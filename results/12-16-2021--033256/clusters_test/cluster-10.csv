"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNFα therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNFα therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNFα therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNFα responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNFα responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNFα therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNFα therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNFα treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Decision Making ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10232047,U01FD007057,[''],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2021,200000
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10223257,R42DA050398,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Belief ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' North America ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment program ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Abstinence ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' implementation science ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' waiver ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' relapse risk ', ' dashboard ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid agonist therapy ', ' opioid agonist treatment ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' treatment services ', ' Suboxone ', ' Bunavail ', ' Zubsolv ', ' buprenorphine + naloxone ', ' buprenorphine and naloxone ', ' buprenorphine with naloxone ', ' buprenorphine-naloxone ', ' buprenorphine/naloxone ', ' phase 2 testing ', ' phase 2 evaluation ', ' phase II evaluation ', ' phase II testing ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Helping to End Addiction Long-term ', ' HEAL Initiative ', ' Helping End Addiction Long-term ', ' Helping End Addiction Longterm ', ' Helping to End Addiction Longterm ', ' gaps in access ', ' access gaps ', ' ']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2021,555498
"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' social factors ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,763554
"PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally. However, a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping (i.e., correctly identifying individuals with a particular trait of interest). Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. However, each requires an extensive investment of time and resources to develop due to the heterogeneity, complexity, inaccuracy, and frequent fragmentation of EHRs. The lack of general, automatic, and portable approaches to enable accurate high- throughput phenotyping is a critical barrier that hampers our ability to leverage valuable clinical data in EHRs for better healthcare. We propose a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that we have developed from public resources and will further refine and implement across various EHRs. We recognize that mass information about phenotypes is often described in significant detail and continuedly accumulated within publicly available resources (e.g., MedlinePlus and Wikipedia). We hypothesize this information can be retrieved, filtered, organized, measured, and formalized into standard EHR phenotype profiles. Indeed, we have used such an ensemble approach to integrate four generalizable online medication resources (e.g., SIDER and RxNorm) to create MEDI--a resource linking 2,136 medications and 13,304 indications. In preliminary studies, we extended this strategy to phenotyping and created a prototype PheMAP. For each phenotype, we identified relevant clinical concepts and weighted each based on its importance to the phenotype. We then mapped all associated concepts to commonly-used clinical terminologies. Our preliminary studies showed an average consistency of 98.6%±0.8% between our early-stage PheMAP and three validated eMERGE algorithms (Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism). We seek support to refine and optimize PheMAP and develop tools to allow researchers to implement PheMAP efficiently in different EHRs. This will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention. Since PheMAP is created using independent resources that are more generalizable than a local clinical dataset, the implementation will generate more consistent outcomes in different EHRs for large-scale analyses.The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to conduct high-throughput genome-wide and phenome-wide association analyses (GWASs and PheWASs). We will use data from multiple biobanks to accomplish these tasks. Specifically, we will achieve the following goals in this grant: 1.refine PheMAP and conduct large-scale validation, 2. implement PheMAP and perform representative GWASs and PheWASs, 3. Use PheMAP to conduct GWASs for unstudied or understudied diseases and phenotypes, and 4. Share PheMAP to facilitate research using EHRs.

"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90).

"Leveraging Electronic Health Records and Genomic Biobanks for Kidney Stone Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Kidney stones are highly prevalent and recurrent. Our current understanding of kidney stone disease risk factors and disease associations has relied primarily on data from chart review, nonspecific administrative datasets, and secondary analyses of observation studies. Current study designs suffer from small sample sizes, heterogenous patient groups, and lack of standardized accuracy data and outcome definitions. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides novel research opportunities for kidney stone disease. EHRs contain a robust clinical repository of data collected over time from clinical care. However, there are currently limited tools to identify and characterize kidney stone patients in the EHR. The objective of this study is to establish feasibility of utilizing EHR data to investigate kidney stone disease. To structure EHR data in an efficient and cost-effective manner, natural language processing and deep learning methods can be designed for identifying and phenotyping kidney stone patients and clinical outcomes. Our de-identified EHR is linked to a DNA biobank that can enable investigation of genetic associations with disease. This project has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform genetic association studies in our EHR and linked DNA biobank. We will replicate previously described associations with genetic variants and kidney stone disease. We will then perform a genome-wide association study to discover novel associations. In Aim 2, our goal is to develop and validate a computable framework to extract clinical outcomes of kidney stone disease from the EHR. Clinically meaningful outcomes include symptomatic stone passage and radiographic stone characterization. We will develop and test natural language processing and deep learning algorithms to extract keywords and context-based information in clinical notes and reports. We will train and test these algorithms using manual annotation as the gold standard. This aim will enable rigorous phenotyping of each kidney stone patient using structured and unstructured EHR data. Successful completion of this project will lay the groundwork towards advancing genomic medicine and precision health to support clinical decision-making in kidney stone patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to establish the feasibility of kidney stone research using electronic health record data. Genetic association studies will be performed to replicate known and discover new variants with kidney stone disease.

"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Dietetics ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Volition ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mimetics ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Update ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Food Energy ', ' obesity management ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' Consumption ', ' human disease ', ' effective intervention ', ' operation ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' robotic system ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' overweight adults ', ' over-weight adults ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research.

"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients.

"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Coughing ', ' Cytochromes ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' isoniazid ', ' Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver Function Tests ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Transferase ', ' Transferase Gene ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Uganda ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' drug-related adverse effects ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' World Health Organization ', ' rifapentine ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pharmacodynamic model ', ' reactivation from latency ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' flu ', ' high risk ', ' alternative treatment ', ' standard of care ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' clinical predictors ', ' human leukocyte antigen testing ', ' HLA testing ', ' HLA typing ', ' human leukocyte antigen typing ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Bibliography ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Bibliographic Databases ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Drug Monitoring ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' rosiglitazone ', ' Avandia ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' systematic review ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' screening ', ' cluster trial ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' trial design ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' adverse event monitoring ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,10127697,R01HL151838,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' aortic valve replacement ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Heart Valve Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Disorder ', ' cardiac valve disease ', ' cardiac valve disorder ', ' cardiac valvular disease ', ' degenerative valvular heart disease ', ' heart valve disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Metabolic ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' LVEF ', ' Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ', ' Complex ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' LV remodeling ', ' left ventricle remodeling ', ' Left Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Structure ', ' cardiac dimension ', ' cardiac size ', ' heart dimension ', ' heart size ', ' heart dimension/size ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' valve replacement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical predictors ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' persistent symptom ', ' chronic symptom ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' proteomic signature ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665495
"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings.

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,10241985,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Home ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,614136
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,10248288,R21AR076612,"['Affect ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Activation ', ' complement pathway regulation ', ' Conceptions ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' France ', ' Future ', ' Germany ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Laboratories ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions.

"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,10113626,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Equipment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Keratitis ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Virulence ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Examination ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self-reflection ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' microbial ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' case control ', ' Provider ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Eye Institute ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' open source ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical risk ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' deep learning ', ' slit lamp imaging ', ' slit lamp biomicroscopy ', ' slit lamp photography ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,397484
"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Archives ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Law Enforcement Officers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' data quality ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' ESTs ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' acronyms ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' coping mechanism ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' course development ', ' class development ', ' course material development ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667
"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,10249946,F31HD102159,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Israel ', ' Joints ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Probability ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Lasso ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' neonatal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' unborn child ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' tailored health care ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' interactive tool ', ' individual patient ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Fetal health ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' neonatal health ', ' newborn health ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2021,34886
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization.

"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation.

"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Auscultation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart murmur ', ' Cardiac Murmurs ', ' Heart Sounds ', ' Cardiac Sounds ', ' Heart Valve Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Disorder ', ' cardiac valve disease ', ' cardiac valve disorder ', ' cardiac valvular disease ', ' degenerative valvular heart disease ', ' heart valve disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Mitral Valve Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Incompetence ', ' Mitral Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Incompetence ', ' Mitral Valve Regurgitation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency ', ' Tricuspid Incompetence ', ' Tricuspid Regurgitation ', ' Tricuspid Valve Incompetence ', ' Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation ', ' Device Designs ', ' Caring ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Adopted ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Eko ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Cardiac ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' cloud software ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical development ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' ']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,860188
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,10215436,R01CA225478,"['Link ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander

"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', '

"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gold ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Histology ', ' Incidence ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Tachycardia ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fiber ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cell mediated therapies ', ' cell-based therapeutic ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' cellular therapy ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Pace Stimulators ', ' Pacemakers ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' RNA marker ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Consequentialism ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' functional loss ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic tool ', ' improved outcome ', ' exercise training ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical translation ', ' preservation ', ' cardioprotection ', ' cardioprotectant ', ' cardioprotective ', ' denoising deep learning ', ' de-noising deep learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor. Monitoring mosquito ecosystems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.  PI: B. Thomas – NIH R21 Project Summary:  Vector control strategies remain one of the most effective ways to protect human populations from the large number of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, zika virus, or West Nile virus. Mosquito populations are generally monitored using physical traps, however this method suffers from many disadvantages. It requires long and expensive laboratory analysis by qualified personnel which drastically reduces the number of observed insects as well as time of trap deployment. Traps also provide a poor estimate of the actual population size or population density because the attractive range of traps is generally unknown and may change with weather conditions. These limitations are strong drawbacks in our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of vector-control strategies (chemicals, biological, environmental modifications etc.). Inferior methods are not necessarily identified which ultimately contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. In this context, we argue that new methodologies to monitor insect population dynamics is key in the necessary effort to improve control program performance.  A team from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Hudson Mosquito Program seeks support to carry out a series of field experiments using a new optical sensor capable of identifying in real-time the family, species, and gender of mosquitoes in its field of view. The laser-based instrument is a dual-wavelength polarization-sensitive stand-off sensor. For each flying insect transiting through the infrared laser beams, the sensor can retrieve the optical properties of the wings and body of the insect as well as its wing beat frequency. Preliminary data from a laboratory prototype and numerical simulations indicate that the instrument, using a supervised machine learning classifier, can identify the species, gender, and gravidity of mosquitoes up to 300 m away. The instrument will be deployed in a high mosquito density area in New Jersey to continuously monitor the mosquito population over the whole season from April to October 2021. Continuous measurements will allow to identify a number of insects that is orders a magnitude higher than physical traps. As the probed volume of air is known, data analysis will provide the population density for each class of insects from which the population dynamics will be derived. In addition, the time and date of each insect transit allow to study the circadian rhythm, peak activities, and behavior as a function of atmospheric conditions measured by a weather station. In 2022, a similar experiment will be conducted at the same location while the Hudson Mosquito Program will conduct a vector control campaign targeting Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, both responsible for the spread of various infectious diseases. The impact of multiple applications of airborne pyrethroid insecticide on targeted and non-targeted insects will be evaluated by studying the mortality rates and population dynamics for each species. Both years, the data will be compared to physical traps on site, the current gold standard method, for further analysis and validation. Project Narrative  Mosquito-borne diseases are a major challenge for Human health as they affect nearly 700 million people every year and result in close to one million deaths; however, lack of reliable data on mosquito populations has become a serious obstacle to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs. The proposed study will make use of a new methodology based on applied optics to remotely count and identify in real-time the species and sex group of flying mosquitoes in their natural habitat. This novel methodology will be used to evaluate the impact of insecticide applications on the population dynamics of key vector of infectious diseases.",Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.,10215105,R21AI153732,"['Aedes ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Culex (Genus) ', ' Culex ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticides ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New Jersey ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Research ', ' Seasons ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weather ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' WNV ', ' West Nile ', ' Wing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Mosquito-borne disease ', ' Mosquito-borne infectious disease ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' Gravidity ', ' flying ', ' Flying body movement ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Property ', ' Habitats ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' egg ', ' optical sensor ', ' prototype ', ' atmospheric conditions ', ' atmosphere conditions ', ' rate of change ', ' Zika Virus ', ' ZIKV ', ' zikav ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue disease ', ' breakbone fever ', ' learning classifier ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' weather stations ', ' meteorological station ', ' ']",NIAID,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,187106
"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[''],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733
"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders. Project Narrative Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy characterized by cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) that often lead to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for treating medically intractable focal onset seizures, this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation can also be used to treat LGS. The intent of the proposed research is to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) involved in GOS, to identify promising detection and stimulation approaches, and to characterize neurophysiological biomarkers of clinical efficacy that will aid future research and clinical practice.",Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for

"Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy Abstract  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of systolic heart failure with poor prognosis and no specific treatment to address the underlying contractile deficit. In addition to the loss of contractility, there is also impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship, an adaptive process that is described as the increase in contractile force in response to increased preload. We are proposing to investigate a novel therapy for DCM that addresses both loss of contractility and impairment in the Frank-Starling relationship. This novel therapy is achieved by increasing intracellular levels of 2-deoxy ATP (dATP) in cardiomyocytes via increasing the expression of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (R1R2), the rate-limiting step in de novo dNTP biosynthesis. Increased intracellular levels dATP in cardiomyocytes increases contraction by enhancing cross-bridge binding and cycling kinetics and improving allosteric activation of contraction. Recent data suggests that in addition to improved contraction, increased dATP level also enhances the Frank Starling relationship. I will propose specific aims to assess the effect of increased dATP on the Frank Starling relationship and contraction in two animal models of DCM. In the first aim, I will use a genetic model of DCM with a D230N mutation in alpha-tropomyosin (D230N Tm). Using recombinant D230N Tm, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation reduces thin filament activation and, as a consequence, the kinetics of contractile activation and relaxation. I will then determine the effect of increasing dATP content on these deficits. Using tissue from transgenic D230N Tm mice, I will test the hypothesis that this mutation decreases calcium sensitivity of force and length-dependent activation. I will correct these functional deficits by increasing dATP content. Using AAV6-cR1R2, an adeno-associated viral vector that restricts R1R2 over-expression to cardiac myocytes, I will test the hypothesis that increasing dATP levels improves contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes, and improves systolic function in both adult and young D230N Tm mice. Similarly, I will use post-infarct model of DCM in rats to evaluate the effect of cross-bridge activation on length dependent activation (LDA)-the Frank Starling relationship at the sarcomere level. Next, I will use alternative agents to increase (dextran, EMD 50733) or decrease (BDM, beryllium fluoride, high inorganic phosphate) cross-bridge recruitment and evaluate their effect on LDA in demembranated post- infarct DCM rat trabecula. I will complete this aim by testing the hypothesis that cross-bridge activation augments LDA in human myocardium from patients with DCM. Extension Project: Use data from above studies in D230N Tm DCM rodent model to simulate realistic cardiac twitches and use machine-learning methods for parameter optimization. Heart failure, the inability for the heart to keep up with its work load, is a growing epidemic in worldwide, with high mortality despite current available medical treatments. In the most common form, the heart is dilated with reduced contractile function. We are proposing a novel mechanism to treat this problem by altering the fuel used for contraction employing the naturally occurring molecule, deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).",Effect of elevated dATP on contractile function and the Frank-Starling relationship in models of dilated cardiomyopathy,10391887,K08HL128826,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' alpha Tropomyosin ', ' α-Tropomyosin ', ' Beryllium ', ' Calcium ', ' Dilated Cardiomyopathy ', ' Congestive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Deoxyadenosines ', ' Adenine Deoxyribonucleosides ', ' Adenylyldeoxyribonucleosides ', ' Dextrans ', ' dextran ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fluorides ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Kinetics ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Relaxation ', ' Ribonucleotide Reductase ', ' Sarcomeres ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Starlings ', ' Sturnidae ', ' Sturnus vulgaris ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Thin Filament ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Recombinants ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Impairment ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K08,2021,44640
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co- occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self- regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than 33% of American adults while weight loss regimens rely on self- monitoring that many people struggle with. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing.,10406434,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,53790
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggest that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcription in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,10404417,R01HD098458,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Association Learning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cytogenetics ', ' Respiratory Diaphragm ', ' Diaphragm ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hernia ', ' Diaphragmatic Hernia ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Syndrome ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' dosage ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' biochip ', ' genome database ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' WNT4 ', ' Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family, Member 4 ', ' WNT4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' microdeletion ', ' Chromosomal microdeletion ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' malformation ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' web based interface ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' parent grant ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Cardiac development ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' SOX7 gene ', ' SOX7 ', ' SRY-Box 7 ', ' septal defect ', ' septum defect ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,121605
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts members of under-represented minority (URM) communi- ties. Unfortunately, URM and other vulnerable communities remain profoundly under-tested. As such, new ap- proaches are needed to disseminate and accomplish testing that could be generalized across the US. New Jersey can serve as a unique, virtual testing laboratory, ranking 11th in the US in population, 2nd in the US (after NY) in the per capita rate of COVID-19 deaths, and 5th in total cases and represents a highly diverse state with substantial Black and Latinx minority populations. At Rutgers, we have assembled cohorts of healthcare workers (HCWs) to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and to enroll subjects for clinical and vaccine trials. While building our cohorts, we recognized many URMs serve as HCWs or personal care aides often in lower-income roles. Further, we also found these workers were more often infected compared with those with higher income occupations. Given these observations, we posit that HCWs in occupations at lower incomes would facilitate testing among their house- holds and their communities. In a sense, these HCWs can serve as ambassadors to catalyze community-based COVID-19 testing. NJ HEROES TOO (New Jersey Healthcare Essential WoRker Outreach and Education Study - Testing Overlooked Occupations) proposes to approach URM HCWs who we have identified as index individu- als who will act as ambassadors to help expand testing in their households and extended networks. In Aim 1, we will co-design, develop and implement an innovative, HCW-centric outreach intervention strategy to engage Black and Latinx minority communities. We will explore community perceptions about COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination to design COVID-19 testing materials and messages that are culturally tailored to address concerns of Black and Latinx minority communities. In Aim 2, we will conduct a mixed methods study to evaluate the effec- tiveness and cost of: (1) the HCW-focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2) standard community engaged outreach, working with community based organizations (CBOs). We will explore contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability. The primary out- come will be uptake of COVID-19 testing in the targeted populations. We propose testing with the novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the first FDA-authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home based self-testing. We hypothesize that a participatory outreach strategy approach focused on identified index HCWs will mobilize quicker uptake of testing within community settings than best-practice CBO recruitment approaches. We also hypothesize that recruitment through index HCWs will be more successful for hard to reach participants compared to a traditional CBO approach. The strategy focusing on HCWs could easily be expanded to other front-line and essential workers, making the strategy generalizable and sustainable. NARRATIVE Through ongoing follow-up of identified under-represented minority members in existing healthcare worker cohorts, we will advance COVID-19 testing in their communities by providing access to testing for their households and extended families. We will compare this outreach approach with other more conventional means of stimulating testing. In light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, this research will help us to find better ways to reach members of vulnerable under-represented minority communities to lessen the impact of

"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society.

"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention.

"Multivariable Artificial Pancreas System to Detect and Mitigate the Effects of Unannounced Physical Activities and Acute Psychological Stress IIT Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated multivariable artificial pancreas that will mitigate meal, physical activity and acute psychological stress challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate glucose levels of people with diabetes. The first generation of artificial pancreas (AP) systems, the hybrid closed-loop AP, collects data from continuous glucose monitoring devices and relies on manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and physical activities. Acute psychological stress and many other physical activities besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to maintaining euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes. Various physical activities and acute psychological stress events affect the metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types, intensities and durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in order to determine the optimal insulin administration. The multivariable artificial pancreas approach provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements. Additionally, this technology would be safer by reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, compared to APs based exclusively on continuous glucose monitoring device data. Such multivariable AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that uses real-time information from continuous glucose monitoring devices and physiological variables obtained from wearable devices worn in free-living daily life.

"Ultrasound clutter and noise improvements applied to echocardiographic left atrial appendage visualization Summary  Ultrasonic imaging is the most widely used advanced imaging modality in the United States, and excluding planar radiography, it represents 44% of all imaging studies. Unfortunately, ultrasound images are often subopti- mal, and some echocardiography studies show degradation in up to 98% of patients. This rate of degradation and the freehand nature of clinical ultrasound means that image quality is more dependent on operator skill than other advanced modalities, but even with the most skilled practitioners, ultrasound completely fails in 11-64% of clinical tasks. Our overall goal for this application is to fundamentally decrease ultrasound failure rates. Low-quality ultrasound is particularly problematic in echocardiography because of its role as a ﬁrst-line tool for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac disease. When transthoracic echo is inadequate more costly and time-consuming exams like transesophageal echo or MRI are required. To (1) facilitate the high volumes of transthoracic echo, (2) im- prove patient comfort and safety (i.e. reduce transesophageal echo), (3) reduce cost and procedure time, and (4) maximize physician efﬁciency, it is crucial to have consistently high quality transthoracic echo. To provide this, we introduce new acquisition and reconstruction solutions for ultrasound imaging.  Echocardiographic imaging of the left atrial appendage is growing in importance in lockstep with the rising incidence of atrial ﬁbrillation, which currently effects as many as 2-6 million Americans and is expected to grow to 6-12 million by 2050. In patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, thrombus may appear in as many as 12-26% of left atria with most appearing in the appendage. Therefore, in patients with current atrial ﬁbrillation the left atrial appendage must be screened with echocardiography for thrombus before cardioversion can be performed to return the heart to sinus rhythm. Further, patients receiving a left atrial appendage closure device due to chronic atrial ﬁbrillation require annual transesophageal echo follow ups to monitor the device. For both cases, the gold- standard and standard-of-care is transesophageal echocardiography, and while the left atrial appendage can be visualized transthoracically, is is rarely used because the image quality is considered too unreliable.  Ultrasound image quality is degraded by both clutter and thermal noise, so to make clinically transforma- tional improvements to ultrasound–and echocardiography speciﬁcally–it is necessary to address both the clutter problem and the noise problem. Addressing both of these issues is becoming increasingly important because recent developments in beamforming have focused on non-linear algorithms (including deep networks), and the performance of these methods are more strongly linked to the noise level compared to conventional beamforming methods. To this end, we introduce both a solution enhancing signal-to-noise ratio using coded excitation and a comprehensive solution for clutter reduction using deep network beamforming. Project Narrative  Ultrasound is the most utilized imaging modality, and echocardiography itself accounts for nearly a ﬁfth of all imaging exams.

"Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep Learning and Commercial Wearables Project Summary/Abstract Research: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality and drivers of healthcare costs in the United States. By 2030, the number of heart failure patients is projected to reach 8 million. If we could predict who will develop heart failure, this would create an opportunity to improve patient experiences and outcomes by initiating earlier behavioral and therapeutic interventions. Electronic health records (EHR) contain information that can be used to predict heart failure before its onset. However, the existing models lead to a large number of false positive predictions, limiting their clinical utility. The PI proposes to augment the EHR data with electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) features to improve the accuracy of predicting the onset of heart failure 12 months in advance. The three modalities of data (EHR, ECG and HRV) will be analyzed using deep learning methods, including novel techniques proposed by the PI. The models will be developed and validated retrospectively using patient data available at Michigan Medicine. The second aim of the proposal is to increase the impact of this research by replacing the clinically measured ECG and HRV with those obtained by consumer wearables such as smart watches. A prospective cohort of patients will wear a wearable device for seven days, which will allow the PI to determine whether the collected information (intermittent ECG, continuous HRV derived from photoplethysmography, and actigraphy), combined with EHR, can provide clinicians with a more effective tool to identify which patients are at risk of heart failure. While this approach will benefit a larger population of patients, it will still be limited to those with past medical history. To further expand the impact of this research to those who wear consumer wearables but have no previous medical history, a limited model that depends only on the information gathered by the wearable device will be evaluated. Thus, the outcomes of this study will include multiple models targeting various populations, such as those with and without prior medical history. Candidate / Career Development: Dr. Sardar Ansari is a computer scientist and statistician with expertise in biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and medical wearable devices. His past research experience includes analysis of ECG signal to improve detection of cardiac arrhythmias and reduce false alarms in intensive care units; detection and removal of noise and motion artifacts in biomedical signals such as ECG and bioimpedance; prediction of hemodynamic decompensation using HRV; and detection of hemorrhagic shock, intradialytic hypotension, and low cardiac index using wearable technology. This award will allow Dr. Ansari to acquire needed additional training in cardiovascular physiology and heart failure pathophysiology through mentorship, didactic training, attending workshops and scientific meetings, and clinical exposure, preparing him for an independent career focused on developing diagnostic and clinical decision support tools for cardiovascular medicine. Project Narrative Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but it is currently difficult to predict who will develop heart failure. In this study, we will apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to multiple types of data (electronic health records, electrocardiography, and heart rate variability) to predict heart failure onset, and we will use wearable devices to improve the predictions and expand their impact to a wider population. We expect the resulting tools will help prevent delayed diagnosis of heart failure, leading to improved medical outcomes, enhanced patient experience, and reduction in healthcare costs.","Prediction

"Population-level Pulmonary Embolism Outcome Prediction with Imaging and Clinical Data: A Multi-Center Study Project Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Risk stratification for acute PE treatment can reduce mortality. Risk scoring systems use clinical and laboratory electronic medical record (EMR) data. In addition, biomarkers on computed tomography imaging can identify which patients with PE are at high risk of death, independent of clinical data. Despite advances in clinical and image-driven scoring systems, improving outcomes in acute PE depends on implementation of patient-specific EMR and imaging data analytic prognostic models at the point of care. The promise of digital medicine stems in part from the hope that by digitizing health data, we can leverage computer information systems to understand and improve care. A method that can make use of these data to predict patient-specific outcomes could not only provide major benefits for patient safety and healthcare quality but also reduce healthcare costs. Unfortunately, most of this information is not yet included in predictive statistical models that clinicians use to improve care delivery. This is because traditional computational methods and techniques are insufficient at accurately analyzing such high volumes of heterogeneous data. The goal of this proposal is to develop an automated precision medicine approach to achieve point-of-care risk stratification for PE patient outcomes using a fusion deep learning strategy that can simultaneously analyze health records and imaging data. An ideal PE risk-scoring system would not only predict mortality, but also assess the risk for the many debilitating long-term consequences of acute PE. Such a system would, therefore, facilitate optimal management and would likely require intelligent use of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data together in order to provide accurate patient -specific risk scoring for multiple PE outcome measures. In order to build a robust model, we propose to apply distributed training of deep learning models across four large US healthcare institutions. By distributing the algorithm rather than the data, we avoid sharing individually identifiable patient information. If successful, this project will be the first endeavor to leverage diagnostic imaging (pixel) data in combination with structured and unstructured EMR data to predict outcomes. We have the ideal research team, experience, and methods to develop an automated risk-scoring system for acute PE patients. Using a powerful combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, this system will provide patient-specific risk scoring for multiple PE outcome measures. Further, this project will foster multi- center collaborations, which will afford us the opportunity to investigate the generalizability of our approach to different populations of PE patients and to train, test, and ultimately deploy our automated predictive model in a variety of clinical environments. Project Narrative Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of death in the United States. This project aims to develop a new ensemble deep learning model and train the model in a distributed fashion on multi-institutional data to automate the risk stratification of PE by integrating diagnostic computed tomography imaging with clinical electronic medical record data. This precision-medicine approach has the potential to rapidly and accurately perform PE risk assessment at the point of care, which could help reduce adverse clinical outcomes and increase our understanding of post-PE complications.",Population-level Pulmonary Embolism Outcome Prediction with Imaging and Clinical Data: A Multi-Center Study,10298306,R01HL155410,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"Deciphering the Endothelial Cell-Cardiomyocyte Crosstalk in LMNA Cardiomyopathy Project Summary/Abstract Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and the leading reason for heart transplantation. Major gaps exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and mutations in the gene that encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C (LMNA) are considered to be the most common cause of DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie “cardiolaminopathy” remain elusive, and it is unknown why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene have such a disproportionate effect on the heart. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), we recently studied a family affected by DCM due to a frameshift variant in LMNA, which showed endothelial dysfunction (Sayed et al. Science Translational Medicine, 2020). This EC dysfunction could be reversed by upregulating Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) by treatment of iPSC-ECs with a subset of statins, including lovastatin. Importantly, this improvement in EC dysfunction had a positive effect on co-cultured iPSC- cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from cardiolaminopathy patients, indicating an intricate crosstalk between the ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy.  Despite impressive progress, little attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in CMs, especially in context to pharmacological stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a multidisciplinary approach that integrates human iPSCs, bioengineering tools, genome editing, and NGS to gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DCM. Using human iPSCs, we propose to decipher the impaired cross-talk between ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy and elucidate the beneficial class effects of statins in improving the EC-CM signaling as a key factor in regulating cardiac function. We will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the genotype-phenotype association of LMNA mutations on ECs and CMs. For this, we will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived cells with 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived EHTs using single-cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA cardiomyopathy by using CRISPR technology and zebrafish animal model. We have provided compelling preliminary data to support the soundness of our hypothesis-driven research proposal, and we are well positioned to achieve the project goals within five years. If successful, our studies will provide a new paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of familial DCM. Project Narrative Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complex cardiac disease is a leading cause of heart failure. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers an experimental human-based model to predict and model individual disease manifestations.

"Reducing cardiac toxicity with deep learning and MRI-guided radiation therapy Cardiac toxicity is a devastating complication of cancer treatment and occurs during, shortly after, or even many years after treatment. Long-term follow up of patients undergoing thoracic radiation, such as lymphoma, lung, and esophageal cancers, has shown that in particular, radiation therapy (RT) can lead to major radiation-induced cardiac toxicities like congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Typically, the standard of care for cardiac dose assessment involves simple heart dose/volume metrics. However, mounting evidence suggests that cardiac substructures contained within the heart are highly radiosensitive and dose to substructures are more strongly associated with overall survival than assessing whole-heart dose/volume metrics. Nevertheless, precise characterization of cardiac substructure dose in routine clinical practice is currently limited because substructures are not visible on CT simulation scans used for RT planning, cardiac MRI are not widely available for cancer patients, and manual delineation is cumbersome, taking 6-10 hours per case. Further, precise localization is complicated by both cardiac and respiratory motion. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate clinically viable novel technologies to localize cardiac substructures for novel cancer therapies and interventions. The rationale for the proposed research is that by developing a robust and efficient clinical framework for cardiac substructure dose assessment, more effective cardiac sparing strategies can be achieved. Our expertise in deep learning coupled with experience in MR-guided RT has laid the groundwork for this paradigm-changing proposal with the long-term goal of optimal cardiac sparing to ultimately reduce radiation- induced cardiac toxicity. To attain the overall objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (i) develop high quality, efficient cardiac substructure segmentation and accurate synthetic CT generation via deep learning, (ii) quantify respiratory and cardiac-induced cardiac substructure motion using a novel 5D-MRI approach and inter-fraction uncertainties to derive margins and planning strategies for robust cardiac sparing, and (iii) evaluate the clinical efficacy of these emerging technologies in a randomized clinical trial for lung cancer evaluating longitudinal changes in cardiac function from MRI, quality of life, echocardiogram, and blood biomarkers between MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy with sparing and standard x-ray based treatment with whole-heart dose metrics. This multi-disciplinary (oncology, cardiology, radiology, and computer science) proposal integrates state of the art technologies while challenging the standard of care of using whole-heart dose evaluations. The research proposed is innovative as it challenges the current, oversimplified classic model of whole-heart dose estimates via several cutting-edge techniques. The research is significant because of its widespread application in other thoracic cancers including lung, breast, lymphoma, esophageal, and future pediatric cancer trials. Ultimately, the overall positive impact is that our pipeline will yield highly effective cardiac substructure sparing to reduce radiation-related cardiac toxicities and maximize therapeutic gains. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it aims to reduce cardiac side effects for cancer patients who undergo radiation therapy. Using advanced image processing methods and a new radiation machine that uses MRI to change the radiation and track tumors during radiation delivery, precise model of sensitive heart components and determine the best way to effectively spare them from radiation. A clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate potential improvements in cardiac function, side effects, and quality of life using our innovative techniques.",Reducing cardiac toxicity with deep

"Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY Hispanics/Latinos are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. While factors underlying this disparity are not well understood, increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Hispanics/Latinos is likely to be a contributory factor. Pathological changes of ADRD begin years before clinical symptoms become evident and interventions are most likely to confer benefit in the earliest stages of ADRD. There is a pressing need to develop tools to detect the earliest manifestations of ADRD, particularly in Hispanics, who develop symptoms of ADRD at earlier ages, yet are diagnosed at more advanced disease stages than other groups. A variety of behaviors show changes in the preclinical stages of ADRD, including sleep, gait speed, and physical activity, among others. Recent innovations in mobile technology now offer novel ways to collect, track, and analyze these behaviors passively and unobtrusively, as a person engages in their daily life. Our preliminary work demonstrated that the application of machine learning models to passively-collected digital health data from smartphones and wearables differentiated persons with and without mild cognitive impairment with 85% accuracy in a primarily non-Hispanic White sample. Guided by the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, we propose to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)-powered analytics and insights, coupled with readily available sensors in consumer electronics (smartphones, wrist-worn wearables), to identify digital biomarkers of ADRD risk, with a focus on vascular contributions to dementia, among Hispanics/Latinos. Augmenting an existing cohort study of Hispanics/Latinos residing in Southern California, the proposed study has three principal aims: Aim 1 involves determining digital signatures of ADRD risk among Hispanics (N=300; aged 50-70 years) using integrated passive mobile sensing features, derived from smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, and machine learning methods. ADRD risk will be defined by cognitive status and CVD risk burden (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking) and will also incorporate apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) and plasma-based AD biomarkers for further classification of ADRD risk. Aim 2 investigates sex differences in digital signatures of ADRD risk and Aim 3 examines the impact of sociocultural factors (e.g., language use, acculturation) on these signatures. We will also investigate whether changes in digital data features predict longitudinal neurocognitive change over a span of three years in a subset of Hispanics with and without ADRD risk. Housed within a renowned research institution at the vanguard of ADRD research and engineering innovations, the proposed study includes a multidisciplinary team with expertise across all aspects of this cutting-edge proposal. Recognizing the value of a community- engaged research approach, we have partnered with community stakeholders to ensure the relevance of our study to the Hispanic community. Our work could revolutionize early detection of ADRD and reduce ADRD disparities by developing a low burden, low-cost approach to identify ADRD risk among Hispanics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is paramount for prevention and treatment efforts, particularly in groups at increased risk for ADRD such as Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States. Consumer-grade mobile technologies present rich sources of data that can be collected passively in real world environments and can overcome the hurdles typically associated with traditional methods for identifying ADRD early. The proposed project will capture and analyze various streams of digital health data, passively-collected via smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, in order to identify digital signatures of ADRD risk in Hispanics/Latinos and reduce health disparities in this vulnerable and understudied segment of the U.S. population.",Identifying Digital Phenotypes of Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Among Hispanics/Latinos,10298104,R01AG070956,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Apo-E ', ' ApoE ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Arteriosclerotic Dementia ', ' vascular contributions to dementia ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' high blood cholesterol ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurofilament ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' tau-1 ', ' p-tau ', ' p-τ ', ' phospho-tau ', ' phospho-τ ', ' phosphorylated tau ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Test Result ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' health data ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Gait speed ', ' secondary analysis ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' social culture ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' community engaged research ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,805050
"Human-AI Collaborations to Improve Accuracy and Mitigate Bias in Acute Dyspnea Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY Acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and hospitalizations each year. Heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common etiologies, representing 2.5 million hospitalizations in the US in 2017. Determining the precise cause of acute dyspnea is critically important but challenging, as presenting symptoms, laboratory testing, and imaging results may be difficult to interpret, particularly in the elderly and patients with comorbid disease or severe illness. Diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment may occur in up to 30% of patients, which is associated with worse patient outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been proposed to augment providers in the diagnostic process and are well-positioned to support the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. However, inaccurate AI tools can also worsen clinician performance. Therefore, simply keeping clinicians “in-the-loop” is not a guaranteed back-stop against a poorly performing model. This proposal seeks to enable effective Clinician-AI collaborations to improve diagnostic accuracy in acute dyspnea. We propose to: 1) evaluate computational strategies to improve the robustness of an AI tool used to support clinicians in the diagnosis of acute dyspnea, 2) test strategies to enhance collaborations between clinicians and AI tools, 3) prospectively evaluate an acute dyspnea AI tool in a clinical environment while evaluating strategies to collect clinician feedback to enable ongoing model improvement. Our multidisciplinary team consisting of experts in clinical medicine, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction are well positioned to tackle these important challenges. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a robust, generalizable acute dyspnea AI tool to augment physicians in the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. More broadly, the proposal will lead to generalizable knowledge to support safer development and integration of AI tools across healthcare settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate diagnosis is critical for patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath), since depending on the cause (e.g., pneumonia versus congestive heart failure) treatment may vary. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can be trained to analyze clinical and imaging data to determine the diagnosis but are susceptible to bias that results in poor generalization performance.

"A MULTIFACETED DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORM TO ADVANCE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT MONITORING, SAFETY, CARE, AND RESEARCH. Project Summary Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 50 million Americans by 2050. In 2019, more than 16 million Americans struggled while providing unpaid care for people with AD/ADRD and they need stigma-free solutions to help remotely monitor challenging AD/ADRD behaviors like falling and wandering. Separate but related, many AD/ADRD clinical trials are siloed and require patient volunteers and their caregivers to travel to in-person appointments. This is burdensome for families, increases the cost to conduct studies, and data collected is often non-representative of daily life. Amissa Inc. has developed a stigma- free, prototype solution to significantly advance AD/ADRD patient monitoring, safety, and caregiving while simultaneously aggregating high-frequency digital biomarkers to advance medical research. Several competitors have developed hardware devices for tracking elderly individuals who wander and/or fall however, AD/ADRD patients express feelings of stress, anxiety, humiliation, burden, and stigma associated with dementia when wearing these “special” devices. AD/ADRD caregivers seek “socially-acceptable” devices that improve health and location monitoring, provide peace of mind, reduce worry, improve patient safety and quality of life without loved ones feeling shame or embarrassment. Amissa’s prototype software application, created for widely available, consumer-grade smartwatches, enables families to remotely monitor when loved ones fall inside or outside the home and help prevent dangerous wandering episodes. Our initial software application also sends emergency push notifications to key stakeholders when loved ones exhibit uncommon behaviors (e.g. sudden change in variable heart rate). This Phase I SBIR proposal is designed to develop a platform which passively and unobtrusively collects time-based behavioral and biometric data from AD/ADRD patient smartwatches in real-life settings to improve caregiving while also establishing a high-frequency cloud database where one does not currently exist for AD/ADRD research. Aim 1 will develop a caregiver-designed AD/ADRD patient monitoring application for off-the-shelf consumer smartwatches and conduct user-experience and user-interface testing to facilitate feedback for iterative product design improvement. Utilizing opt-in user data from Amissa’s caregiver monitoring application, Aim 2 will establish a novel high-frequency behavioral and biometric cloud database to advance AD/ADRD digital biomarker research capabilities to predict patient falls an wandering. Amissa’s project intends to enable faster collection of multimodal data via broader demographic populations to advance AD/ADRD medical research. This Phase I SBIR has the potential for high impact by providing a single, low-cost, digital technology solution to improve AD/ADRD patient care and safety while reducing stress for caregivers and families. Furthermore, this research will improve capabilities and reduce costs of conducting decentralized clinical trials in real-life environments. At scale, our goal is to advance the forecasting of symptom trajectories and enable physicians to suggest personalized preventative treatments to delay onset or prevent AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Utilizing consumer-grade smartwatches and a cloud-based analytics platform to support real-time, real- world, passive and unobtrusive collection of biometric and behavioral data, this project aims to develop and test a free downloadable mobile application to significantly improve remote patient monitoring of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD). This Phase I SBIR aims to reduce caregiver/partner stress and worry by providing a low-cost resource to monitor loved ones with challenging behaviors and, as an easily downloaded mobile application, this project aims to broadly expand capabilities to conduct remote/decentralized clinical trials and support the evaluation of community-based objective outcomes. The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could deliver large sets of high-frequency data to identify and validate digital biomarkers and improve knowledge about the behaviors of people with AD/ADRD in free-living environments.","A MULTIFACETED DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORM TO ADVANCE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT MONITORING, SAFETY, CARE, AND RESEARCH.",10325493,R43AG072981,"['Affect ', '

"A simulation-based technology for stochastic modeling, sensitivity analysis and design optimization, aimed at development of next-generation micro-fluidic devices for biomedical applications. During an epidemic, testing numerous patients puts a heavy burden on the healthcare sector, while infections continue to rise in the absence of a treatment. In such a scenario, micro-fluidics technology can be used to develop affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools for detecting infected patients early, and effective drug discovery platforms for synthesizing therapeutic drugs. The development of such devices is extremely challenging, needing expertise in multiple disciplines (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology), and understanding the interplay between variables that influence operating performance requires computational assistance. While advanced design software may be adopted to simulate the performance of such devices, precise knowledge of prediction reliability is of paramount importance to ensure their suitability for clinical decision-making. Therefore, the long term objectives of this project are to commercially introduce a new paradigm of digital engineering design that focuses on evaluating the fluctuations in performance outputs due to variability in input parameters and to demonstrate the relevance of such a simulation-based technology through specific application to development of micro-fluidic biomedical devices. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a modular computational system with practical commercial applications in the healthcare sector that demonstrates how scientific computing, numerical simulation & artificial intelligence modeling approaches can lead to an increased understanding of the performance of a micro-fluidic system subject to operating uncertainty, and enable robust design optimization. The proposed approach is to employ innovative stochastic spectral methods & advanced numerical schemes to conduct computationally efficient, high fidelity simulations involving uncertainty quantification & propagation, model sensitivity analysis, and finite element analysis for the engineering evaluation of progressively complex micro-fluidic device designs, and to incorporate artificial intelligence based meta-modeling techniques to perform design space exploration for performance improvement of such devices. The R&D efforts would establish the technical merits & feasibility of a simulation- based technology for predictive stochastic analysis & multi-disciplinary engineering evaluation of novel micro- fluidic devices that addresses the need for efficient & accurate performance assessment of such devices in practical (often uncertain/variable) operating scenarios. It could subsequently be utilized by biomedical engineers to foster the rapid development of robust next-generation devices that operate reliably within desired operating performance specifications, such as diagnostic tools with improved detection sensitivity & specificity, and drug discovery platforms with enhanced reconstitution of complex cellular interactions. These can play a crucial role in rapid short-term response to control the spread of infections & to mitigate disease outbreaks, while also offering improved solutions for enhancing long-term access to primary healthcare & comprehensive disease treatment, thereby significantly improving public health, particularly in resource constrained settings. Infectious ailments affect more than 400M people worldwide annually, accounting for almost 30% of disability- adjusted-life-years (DALYs, i.e. number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death), and for many of these conditions, bringing affordable diagnosis & effective therapeutic drugs to the point-of-need is key to reducing morbidity and mortality. In this regard, micro-fluidics technology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for pathogen detection that offer quick turnaround, clinically relevant detection limit, & portability, and drug discovery platforms for therapeutic drug synthesis that offer rapid screening, high throughput, & reduced cost. The rising popularity of such technology and its growing demand is driving innovation toward devices that need to exhibit precision, durability, repeatability & reliability, and the proposed stochastic simulation-based technology would support the development of such robust solutions, resulting in safer, more effective biomedical devices that improve public health globally.","A simulation-based technology for stochastic modeling, sensitivity analysis and design optimization, aimed at development of next-generation micro-fluidic devices for biomedical applications.",10323474,R43EB032276,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemistry ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' polynomials ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Probability ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Thermal Conductivity ', ' Work ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Device Designs ', ' Equipment Malfunction ', ' Device Failures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Space Explorations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' drug discovery ', ' Drug Synthesis and Chemistry ', ' drug synthesis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Address ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' Food Safety ', ' global health ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' disability-adjusted life years ', ' DALY ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' rapid detection ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' scientific computing ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' engineering design ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' simulation software ', ' screening ', ' Formulation ', ' microfluidic technology ', ' µfluidic technology ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' Rapid screening ', ' detection limit ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' ']",NIBIB,SOFTWORTHY LLC,R43,2021,216930
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus.

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Calibration ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Grant ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Manuals ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' falls ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' Artificial Pancreas ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' engineering design ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' risk minimization ', ' risk mitigation ', ' arm ', ' support tools ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Bluetooth ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' Injections ', ' in silico ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diabetes distress ', ' implementation design ', ' implementation research design ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development Project Summary Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm) are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses” between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies, and causal inference. Project Narrative Early human development is a crucial time period in which the structures of primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm are formed and errors in cellular differentiation can have dire consequences. This fellowship proposal seeks to advance our fundamental understanding of how human embryonic stem cells decide specific differentiation fates using advanced machine learning methodologies. The findings from this work will help develop future stem cell therapies for treatment of birth defects and miscarriages in early primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm formation, ultimately

"Skin-like, stretchable, and wearable sensors for monitoring QT interval and hemodynamic variables in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, carries a lifetime risk of 25-33%, and cost the US healthcare system > 6 Billion dollars a year. Morbidities from AF include congestive heart failure, dementia, symptoms due to decreased cardiac output, and most importantly an elevated thrombotic stroke risk due to blood stasis. Recent advances in wearable technology have increased the capacity and accuracy of AF diagnosis through monitoring heart rate variability in an ambulatory setting. However, there remains no available ambulatory technologies that permit continuous assessment of the hemodynamic effects of AF nor measurements of cardiac repolarization that determine the proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. Some treatment aspects of AF have remained controversial due to limited efficacy of rhythm control interventions including cardiac ablation and pharmacologic therapy, both of which have significant risks. Pharmacologic interventions using Class III antiarrhythmics are especially risky due to the proarrhythmic effects on ventricular repolarization which can lead to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. As a result of these issues, careful assessment of ventricular repolarization, as represented by the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), is required during drug initiation. This requires lengthy and costly inpatient monitoring during drug loading and difficulties in maintaining the narrow therapeutic window after discharge. Having a reliable method to quantify measures of hemodynamic instability that leads to some AF- related symptoms, as well as continuously monitoring the QT interval and other clinically important parameters in an ambulatory setting would allow clinicians to tailor their care to the individual. This proposal aims to refine a flexible, non-obtrusive wearable system to continuously monitor these key clinical parameters, help in predicting heart rhythm complications and regulate medication intervention for both rhythm control and rate control of AF. A sensor suite consisting of a small, wireless and flexible chest-worn patch that measures both ECG and accelerometer based seismocardiography (SCG) and a wirelessly time synchronized flexible limb unit capable of monitoring photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals will be used. Aim 1 will quantitatively define the optimal location for QT interval monitoring on the surface of the chest. Aim 2 will combine the ECG, SCG, and PPG data streams and extract both unique and time-relational parameters from the signal streams known to be related to cardiac function and hemodynamics, using machine learning to obtain predictions of hemodynamic instability from these complex relationships. Aim 3 will address the use and compliance of this wearable system in a clinical setting against the standard of care during Class III antiarrhythmic drug loading and pharmacologic cardioversion. The results from this study will provide the first ambulatory measures of AF symptoms and responses to treatment, informing future studies and clinical care teams of the dominant bioelectrical and biomechanical parameters that are the most important in the care of the growing, aging population with AF. Project Narrative  Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent disease in advanced age, a frequent comorbidity to many common diseases, and contributes to increased hospitalization risk and healthcare costs. This project aims to develop a mobile telemonitoring platform to simultaneously monitor symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as hemodynamic instability and rhythm disturbances, as well as allow the patient and clinician to monitor, predict, and intervene to significant side effects of common pharmacologic treatment of the disease.","Skin-like, stretchable, and wearable sensors for monitoring QT

"COVID-19 disease course analysis using multi-site large-scale EHR data Project Summary/Abstract  Since its ﬁrst case reported in December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pan- demic in 188 countries/regions, and has precipitated an unprecedented health, economic and social crisis. In order to cope with the volatile dynamic and severity of the pandemic, it is imperative that we characterize the various clinical courses of COVID-19 infection, and determine whether and how demographic, clinical and other variables inﬂuence them. Knowledge of the disease's transmission, symptomatology, clinical course, treatment and outcomes is rapidly evolving based on many sources. An important source for advancing this knowledge is data from electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE) because they can pro- vide a real-time, unvarnished view of the disease. Using large-scale, well-integrated and rich EHR data enables comprehensive proﬁling and quantiﬁcation of the COVID-19 disease course that can directly inform clinical prac- tice. The long-term goal of our research is to develop Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) tools to facilitate access to and analysis of clinical data. The goal of this application is to develop effective algorithms and tools to mine clinical data to categorize disease courses of COVID-19, and determine the effect of clinical and other variables asso- ciated with them. We will develop our algorithms using data from a large and comprehensive health information exchange, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), which has about 40,000 COVID-19 patients and fairly complete EHR data about them. We will evaluate the algorithms against other data sets, including EHR data from the OSU Wexner Medical Center and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The speciﬁc aims of this project are to (1) develop COVID-19 disease course groupings, (2) relate comorbidities and other clinical variables to the COVID-19 disease course, and (3) validate the developed algorithms on N3C data. This pro- posal is signiﬁcant because the methods developed in this project have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase our capability for computational analysis of large and rich patient data during the pandemic and beyond; the knowl- edge derived from our comprehensive proﬁling of COVID-19 courses over large, inclusive patient populations supported by rich EHR data can positively impact clinical practice; and the tools developed in this project will be released to the public as a free COVID-19 research re- source. It is innovative because our methods integrate novel methods such as patient clustering using clinical variables and disease progression trajectories, and pa- tient trajectory comparison, with established univariate and predictive analysis; our primary approach will lever- age the oldest and one of the country's largest HIEs to derive detailed and comprehensive knowledge about a large patient population; and the strong preliminary data generated by this project can help improve COVID-19 patient phenotyping, disease characterization and diagnosis.

"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life. Promoting adherence with topical medications that lower intraocular pressure, the primary therapeutic target for reducing the risk of glaucoma progression, represents a critical opportunity for technology-driven interventions. The iGLAMOUR (innovations in GLaucoma Adherence and Monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities) Study aims to develop and evaluate a health information technology framework incorporating flexible sensor electronics, machine learning-based predictive models, a patient- facing mobile interface, and a clinician-facing clinical dashboard to facilitate early identification and intervention for

"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Adoption ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Infection Control ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' data resource ', ' screening program ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,10116464,R01LM006910,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' deep learning ', ' clinical database ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' ']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,568584
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Moods ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders,10064583,R01MH116270,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clozapine ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroconvulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Convulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Psychotherapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive treatment ', ' Electroshock Psychotherapy ', ' Electroshock Therapy ', ' Electroshock treatment ', ' electric shock treatment ', ' electro-convulsive therapy ', ' electroplexy shock therapy ', ' shock treatment ', ' Engineering ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care.

"Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiac valves are critical to the maintenance of unidirectional blood flow in the heart. Congenital and acquired valvulopathies are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both the pediatric and adult populations. Current therapeutic strategies are limited, often requiring surgical replacement with suboptimal prostheses. Valvulogenesis begins with formation of the endocardial cushions via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many of the signaling pathways regulating this EMT event have been defined; however, little is known about the molecular regulators of post-EMT valvulogenesis. Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect, is characterized by variably dysplastic, muscularized tricuspid valve leaflets that are often tethered to the underlying myocardium, resulting in apical displacement of the annulus and atrialization of the right ventricle. This defect is often attributed to a failure of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of post-EMT valvulogenesis during which the primordial valve leaflets separate from the underlying myocardium. Previous studies suggest that altered differentiation dynamics of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of this valvular defect. I propose to define the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via a multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly, leveraging an Ebstein’s Anomaly murine model system, primary human tissue, and human genetics data. In my first aim, I will use spatiotemporal single cell RNA sequencing and human genetics analyses to identify the atrioventricular cushion signaling interactions regulating valvular delamination. In my second aim, I will use an integrated single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing approach to define the gene regulatory networks driving VIC fate determination. My primary sponsor, Dr. Deepak Srivastava, has extensive expertise in developmental cardiac biology, human genetics, and stem cell biology. My co- sponsor, Dr. Chun (Jimmie) Ye, has an expertise in experimental and computational single cell genomics. Their collective expertise will assure that I receive the necessary training and mentorship to complete the proposed research. To obtain the rare tissue samples required for my project, I have formed a multi-center collaboration with two high volume Ebstein’s Anomaly patient centers. Additionally, I have secured expertise in human genetics and machine learning from Dr. Jingjing Li, Ph.D., in support of the human genetics component of my project. Concurrently, I am engaging in a longitudinal clinical preceptorship in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery with my clinical training co-sponsor, Dr. Peter Kouretas, Surgical Director of the UCSF Pediatric Heart Transplantation Program. Overall, the proposed research will elucidate previously uncharacterized mechanisms of late atrioventricular valvular morphogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative-medicine based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies. F30 NRSA fellowship support would foster my expertise in developmental cardiac biology and computational genomics, furthering me toward my ultimate career goal of becoming an academic pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The molecular regulators of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of valvulogenesis whose dysfunction underlies a rare tricuspid valve malformation, Ebstein’s Anomaly – remain largely unknown. I will apply an innovative multi-omic approach to identify the intercellular interactions regulating this morphogenetic process and define the gene regulatory networks that drive valvular interstitial cell fate determination. This study will deepen our understanding of valvulogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative medicine-based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies.",Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly,10233685,F30HL158170,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', "" Ebstein's Anomaly "", ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Endothelium ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Heart Valves ', ' Cardiac Valves ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morbidity -

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre-procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed-methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative  With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID-19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Services ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marital Status ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A two-dimensional antiscatter grid for dental cone beam computed tomography Project summary Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a commonly used 3D x-ray imaging modality in dental and craniofacial imaging. While CBCT is primarily employed in evaluating bony anatomy in 3D, soft tissues are often poorly visualized in dental CBCT images. Moreover, tissue densities cannot be extracted accurately from CBCT images. The main culprit behind this problem is scattered radiation. Scattered x-rays emanating from the patient are registered by the x-ray sensor, severely degrading the fidelity of image signals. Thus, in this project, we propose a novel two-dimensional antiscatter grid (2D grid) to substantially improve the dental CBCT image quality. Our proposed 2D grid will attenuate scattered x-rays effectively, while transmitting primary, or useful, x-rays to the image sensor. Once successfully implemented, our 2D grid will provide significantly improved soft tissue visualization, accurate bone density measurement, and will reduce image artifacts. Alternatively, our 2D grid can reduce imaging radiation dose while providing comparable contrast-to- noise ratio with respect to current dental CBCT images. To implement our proposed 2D grid technology, (1) we will investigate the optimal physical characteristics of 2D grids to achieve effective scatter suppression and high primary transmission. (2) We will evaluate the improvement in CBCT image quality provided by 2D grid in phantom imaging experiments. Project narrative While cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the most commonly used 3D imaging modality in dentistry, its utilization is hampered by its poor image quality. The main culprit behind this problem is the high intensity of scattered radiation inherent to CBCT systems.

"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts. We will evaluate the impact of hypothetical lifestyle and clinical risk factors interventions on reducing the racial/ethnic disparities in developing HF.

"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,10227786,K23HL145017,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Flecainide ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10227088,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitals ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Iodine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' time interval ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Preparation ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' standard of care ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2021,1040660
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10220922,R01DA046620,"['Buprenorphine ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Naloxone ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Overdose ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' resource guides ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Academic Detailing ', ' Data ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Sum ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' overdose prevention ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid policy ', ' opioid guideline ', ' opioid law ', ' opioid legislation ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid agonist therapy ', ' opioid agonist treatment ', ' referral services ', ' overdose risk ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,807350
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality.

"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10247089,K01HL150318,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atlases ', ' California ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Modernization ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' pressure ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Process ', ' electronic data ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' genetic information ', ' online course ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' Infrastructure ', ' random forest ', ' long short term memory ', ' multiple data sources ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2021,175284
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10246527,R01HL151277,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', '

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10254271,R01HS027369,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,496877
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities.

"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10372655,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,52000
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world’s population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning (ML) and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of the parent project is to improve human health and positively impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this supplement project is to extend the design of our ‘clinician-in-the-loop’ smart home to include computational methods for recognizing and reporting on bias in ML algorithms. Bias in ML algorithms is a public health hazard. A secondary objective is to add to the scarce body of knowledge regarding ML techniques for assessing and quantifying algorithm bias. In this supplement study, we will demonstrate how to operationalize bioethics principles such as autonomy (the right to make informed decisions about care and right to be informed about any associated risks) into actionable design requirements to close the gap between principles and practice. We will then share these with the ML healthcare application (ML- HCA) research community by creating a new open source online course containing 3 modules. This supplement proposal builds upon our extensive experience in the CASAS lab at Washington State University and prior collaboration on the development of smart home design, activity recognition, and the use of these technologies for functional health monitoring, assessment, and intervention. This supplement effort will allow us to expand our sample size and enhance the robustness of pervasive-computing-based behavior monitoring and machine learning to further advance the quality of health monitoring, including bias recognition. We will offer new advances in computational methods for anti-bias algorithm development using data from smart homes and smart watches that are monitoring the daily activities of underrepresented persons. Our course modules will support knowledge development regarding how to operationalize bioethics principles for practice at each stage of ML-HCA design. In the online course we will also address the importance and impact of multidisciplinary teams in designing for transparency, fairness, and non-discriminatory ML-HCA applications such as the health smart home. Given that ML models are known to introduce bias and risk to members of minority groups and given our national conversation on equity, fundamental human rights, and the risks associated with living as a minority person, it is critical that health technology-human interface with underrepresented persons is improved. Anti-bias ML training techniques that could be broadly applied in the development of ML-HCAs would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and all of society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on the parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use smart home and wearable data from minority persons for developing clinician-guided novel computational methods to train our ML models to recognize and report on bias of sensitive demographic features (e.g., race, low SES) to mitigate the negative impacts of bias on informed consenting and autonomous decision-making regarding health monitoring that uses an intelligent agent. This research is relevant to public health because technologies that do not perpetuate bias would be of significant value to minority individuals and families and to all of society.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,10367017,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Rights ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Intelligence ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Health Hazards ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' parent project ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' course module ', ' class module ', ' online course ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' brain health ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' health assessment ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' smart home ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' intelligent agent ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' Home ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,144139
"Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening PROJECT SUMMARY The CDC recommends that each of the 34.2 million patients with diabetes in the United States is screened annually for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of preventable blindness. Less than 50% of diabetes patients actually follow these guidelines due to lack of access to medical care and eye specialists, time and money constraints, and lack of symptoms with early-stage disease. To address these problems, our team at AI Optics is developing the world’s first artificial intelligence-based handheld retinal camera to allow for point-of-care DR screening. This device is designed to be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly. It performs high-accuracy DR screenings on non-dilated patients, maintaining optimal security and remaining resilient to connectivity issues. Our goal is that this novel diagnostic device will expand DR screenings beyond the offices of eye specialists and into primary care, optometry offices, diabetes clinics, and retail health settings. This increased access to screening will increase early-stage diagnosis rates and avoid preventable vision loss. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop a retinal camera that complies with ISO 10940:2009 standards, which will be able to capture high-quality fundus images in a handheld device. To ensure that full-scale image classification can be conducted, we will also utilize our proprietary, deep-learning artificial intelligence system. Finally, we will ensure that images captured from our retinal camera can be analyzed by our artificial intelligence for the presence of DR. The successful completion of this project will result in an improved and more accessible tool for DR screenings that could lead to earlier DR diagnosis, blindness prevention, and significant cost savings for millions of people with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Less than 50% of the 34.2 million people with diabetes in the United States follow CDC guidelines to get annual screenings for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness that impacts up to 40% of diabetic patients. To address this problem, we propose the development of the world’s first handheld retinal camera that uses artificial intelligence for point-of-care DR screenings in primary care, urgent care, and retail health settings.

"An automated system to interpret echocardiography to predict adverse outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction in daily hospital practice Project Summary Right ventricle (RV) dysfunction is a common and complex form of pediatric heart disease. It is also a common contributor to morbidity and mortality for patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD). Due to the complex geometry of the RV and its relative adaptability to changing physiologic conditions, RV dysfunction is poorly understood and difficult to characterize precisely and accurately, thus diagnosis is often delayed. The most common diagnosis tool is echocardiograms. Manual review of echocardiograms is time consuming, however. Furthermore, there might be uncovered echocardiogram patterns associated with RV dysfunctions. In adult studies, machine learning models (MLM) have been successfully implemented to assess RV functions by echocardiograms. We hypothesize that applying novel MLM to pediatric echocardiograms will allow us to improve the accuracy and reliability of assessment, as well as identify novel markers of RV dysfunction. We propose to develop an automated tool to generate a RV health score to identify RV dysfunction and predict the development and time of adverse outcomes including heart failure, heart and/or lung transplantation, and death. The automated tool will constitute an early warning system module, which will be deployed onto a big-data-based risk prediction platform developed by our small business. The study has three specific aims. First, we will extract echocardiograms and structured electronic medical records from the Stanford Children’s Hospital. Cohorts of children with normal or abnormal RV will be constructed. Second, MLM will be developed and validated to 1) predict the presence of RV dysfunction and the probability of adverse outcomes, and 2) predict the rate of progression to adverse outcomes. A deep learning-based workflow will be established to take input of pediatric echocardiogram and clinical data and generate predictions. Third, we will integrate the models developed in Aim #2 into the HBI Spotlight Solutions. The Spotlight Solutions include a healthcare surveillance platform with high-capacity data infrastructure and risk engines to offer AI solutions to care facilities participating the Healthix, the largest public health information exchange network in the US. This will prepare our algorithms for further clinical validation in other cohorts. Project narrative The machine learning models developed in this study will be applicable to any infant, child or adolescent undergoing an echocardiogram, particularly those requiring serial exams to assess changes from disease progression or treatment effect. It can be adopted by pediatric clinicians to assess cardiac function with a high degree of accuracy and confidence, even for those who have little training in echocardiography, thus improving access to healthcare and potentially reducing costs.",An automated system to interpret echocardiography to predict adverse outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction in daily hospital practice,10326000,R41HL160362,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Automation ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' lung transplant ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Right ventricular structure ', ' Right Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Right Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' billing data ', ' treatment effect ', ' Plug-in ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' electronic structure ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Geometry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' individual patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Precision Health ', ' deep learning ', ' data infrastructure ', ' structured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"MPROBE, INC.",R41,2021,346545
"Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction PROJECT SUMMARY Current treatment options for addiction do not sufficiently address the clinical needs of patients. Due to low efficacy, misaligned treatment objectives, or lack of accessibility, patients are not able to durably abstain from substances or reduce their use to safer levels. Substitution therapy (ST) is a proven treatment approach and has resulted in massive global public health benefits for tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder; however, the potential impact of ST is limited by concerns for causing more widespread harms. Thus substitution therapy is either underutilized or underexplored in other addictions due to risks of abuse, misuse, and diversion. Through implementing safe prescribing systems, health systems have solved for the provision of existing ST like methadone and buprenorphine. Nevertheless, there remains significant potential for broader access to current and novel ST treatments by utilizing advancement in software and hardware technology. Atman Therapeutics is an early-stage company seeking to develop novel therapeutics in addictive disorders. We are developing a platform to enable increased access to as well as novel development of ST. To achieve this objective, our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning methods, patient-centered research, and sophisticated hardware technology. Our technology will also enable the concurrent delivery of contingency management services, thus creating safe, engaging, and durably effective treatments for these complex neurobehavioral disorders. This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) project aims to establish the feasibility of machine learning and integrated sensor technologies to confirm medication adherence in a diverse sample of patients. We will develop a deep-learning algorithm utilizing a feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet- 50, U-NET, PCU-Net, to enact classification of medication ingestion events. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a hardware microcontroller unit with multi-dimensional MEMS sensors into a device that can classify ingestion events in a highly sensitive and specific manner. These efforts will demonstrate the early feasibility of the Atman platform and form the basis for regulated development efforts of ST-enabling products and services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop automated methods to confirm ingestion of medication, as this is a critical step to ensure medication compliance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will demonstrate the feasibility of automated ingestion confirmation and integrate hardware components capable of accurately confirming ingestion to enable a novel

"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Industry ', ' Italy ', ' Leadership ', ' Locomotion ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity -

"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10358343,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10267167,DP1NS122038,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' next generation ', ' brain computer interface ', ' brain machine interface ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' cloud based ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2021,1137500
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,10226146,R01CA225446,"['Appointment ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Ownership ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' socio-linguistics ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Institution ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' UMLS Metathesaurus ', ' Metathesaurus ', ' Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' illness perceptions ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' natural language ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10225458,R21EY031898,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' India ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Ocular Hypertension ', ' ocular hypertensive ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Label ', ' Fundus photography ', ' eye fundus photography ', ' fundus camera ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Fundus ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' cost effective ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Consumption ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal database ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' learning network ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' algorithm training ', ' teleophthalmology ', ' ']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,195212
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart

"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects Project Summary We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects (CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear stress to gene expression.  This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.  Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more effectively. Project Narrative Abnormal blood flow has been shown to play a role in the formation of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, few tools exist to study how forces exerted by blood flow early in heart development result in altered molecular signaling. Our proposal centers on creating optical imaging to investigate mechanical stresses experienced by cells lining the beating, early-stage heart tube and how these cells and adjacent tissues respond in gene expression in each area of the heart during normal, diseased, and rescued conditions.",Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects,10211096,R01HL126747,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Betaine ', ' Lycine ', ' Oxyneurine ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diffusion ', ' DiGeorge Syndrome ', ' 22q11 Chromosomal Microdeletion Syndrome ', ' 22q11 Deletion Syndrome ', ' 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ', ' 22q11.2DS ', ' 22q11DS ', ' Autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome ', ' Cayler cardiofacial syndrome ', ' Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ', ' Di George syndrome ', ' DiGeorge anomaly ', ' DiGeorge sequence ', ' branchial arch syndrome ', ' conotruncal anomaly face syndrome ', ' familial third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' thymic and parathyroid agenesis syndrome ', ' thymic aplasia syndrome ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive

"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction.

"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Update ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' transplant registry ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' organ allocation ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' simulation software ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' transplant centers ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,10086491,K23HL135274,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' preempt ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Theory of Change ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' advanced analytics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital medicine ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,203678
"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV. This R03 proposal focuses on applying advanced clinical informatics to assemble a large AAV cohort and characterizing how complications co-occur (i.e., complication clusters) in AAV.",Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters,10198103,R03AR078938,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Complication ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Clusterings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Remission Induction ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Rheumatologic Disorder ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Vasculitis ', ' Angiitis ', ' vasculitides ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies ', ' ANCA ', ' Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' case finding ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Flare ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' ANCA vasculitis ', ' ANCA associated vasculitis ', ' Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis ', ' Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis ', ' antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis ', ' antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Treatment-related toxicity ', ' therapeutic toxicity ', ' therapy toxicity ', ' treatment toxicity ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' ']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,105843
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices.

"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research.

Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,10149327,R21LM013937,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Iris ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Terminology ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Exfoliation Syndrome ', ' Exfoliative Syndrome ', ' Glaucoma Capsulare ', ' Pseudo-Exfoliation Syndrome ', ' Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' data registry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Data Discovery ', ' clinical decision support ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' deep learning ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' data framework ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' clinical encounter ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,186725
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Calcium ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Catheterization ', ' Cathetergram ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stents ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' attenuation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Reader ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Myocardial ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial

"A personalized preventive care recommendation system by integrating guidelines with the EHR data PROJECT SUMMARY Most health systems globally were designed to be reactive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States reported that 90% of the nation's $3.3 trillion annual healthcare expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions. Therefore, preventing diseases is key to improving people's health and keeping rising health costs under control. The criteria in the preventive care clinical decision support (CDS) modules in most of the EHR systems are limited to age, gender, and screening intervals. This ""one size fits all"" preventive care CDS does not provide any personalized recommendations by considering the risk factors that relate to a patient's family history, social behavior history, ethnicity, and various chronic disease history. Social history, including behavioral and environmental determinants, are increasingly recognized as critical risk factors for many causes of disease, disability, and mortality in the United States. Very little research has been conducted on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and artificial intelligence techniques to extract information from the preventive care guidelines and EHR data to generate personalized preventive care recommendations by considering the risk factors. Since most of the risk factors, such as social behaviors are rarely systematically extracted from the clinical notes, linking this information to preventive care is still very uncommon. The main objective of this research proposal is to develop a system to generate personalized preventive recommendations by using information extracted from the preventive care guidelines and the information, including risk factors extracted from the EHR data. The personalized preventive recommendations will provide the recommendations as well as rationales based on the EHR data and preventive care guidelines. Our long-term goal is to automate the integration of various preventive care guidelines with the EHR data to generate personalized preventive care recommendations, to engage more patients in preventive care, and to reduce the healthcare cost and improve population health. The innovative NLP methods and deep learning- based algorithms can be used to extract information from other narrative guidelines so that they to be analyzed with the EHR data. We will (1) use a proposed EHR component-based data interchange structure to analyze the extracted information consistently; (2) extract information from the clinical guidelines automatically; (3) extract the risk factors, such as social behaviors, symptoms and other risk factors from the structured and unstructured EHR data using innovative NLP processing; (4) evaluate the efficiency, accuracy and usability of the personalized preventive care system through involving both healthcare providers and patients. We will utilize the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) - a statewide clinical data warehouse. Our rigorous methods and the availability of the EHR data make it possible in the future to explore (1) personalized healthcare by considering risk factors extracted from the EHR, and (2) improved patient engagement in disease prevention and management by utilizing EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Generating personalized preventive care recommendations by considering various risk factors recorded in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) has not been studied.

"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,10168666,R01NS107291,"['Algorithms ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epidemic ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Neurology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uremia ', ' uremia of renal origin ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' computer science ', ' Nomenclature ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Subclinical Seizures ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' iatrogenic ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' clinical care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' clinically actionable ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' improved outcome ', ' brain health ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' disability risk ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555363
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' CO2 ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Early Mobilizations ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chest wall structure ', ' Chest Wall ', ' Thoracic Wall ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Choices and Control ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Outcome ', ' coronary perfusion ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ', ' algorithm training ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,608552
"Semi-supervised Approaches to Denoising Electronic Health Records Data for Risk Prediction Project Summary While clinical trials remain a critical source for oncology research, their study findings may not be gener- alizable to the real world due to the restricted patient population. In recent years, due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and the linkage of EHR with specimen bio-repositories and other research registries, integrated large datasets now exist as a new source for translational research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based prediction models for disease progression and treatment response, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice. These models can also be contrasted with models derived from clinical trials, bridging the gap between clinical trials and the real world. However, efficiently deriving and evaluating personalized prediction models using such real world data (RWD) remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, validated outcome information from EHR, such as development of colon cancer and 1-year treatment response, requires laborious medical record review and hence is often not readily available for research. Naive use of error prone surrogates of the outcome, such as billing codes or procedure codes, as the true outcome may greatly hamper the power of EHR studies and produce biased results. Semi-supervised risk prediction methods, leveraging noisy surrogates and a small amount of human annotations on the outcome, may greatly improve the utility of EHR for precision medicine research. Deriving a precise estimate of the risk model becomes even more challenging when the number of candidate features is not small relative to the number of annotated outcomes. Another major challenge with EHR risk modeling lies in the transportability. Complex machine learning models trained in one EHR system often attain low accuracy in another EHR system, due to the heterogeneity in the patient population and healthcare system. Transfer learning methods that can automatically adjust model developed for one EHR cohort to better fit to another EHR cohort is of great value. Synthesizing information from multiple data sources can improve the quality of evidence. However, meta analyzing EHR from multiple EHR cohorts faces an additional challenge due to patient privacy. We address these challenges by developing semi-supervised risk prediction methods with high dimensional predictions in Aim 1; semi-supervised transfer learning methods to enable risk prediction modeling in target populations with no gold standard labels uted learin Aim 2; and distributed learning methods for high dimensional predictive modeling in Aim. Project Narrative The research proposal addresses the pressing need for advanced statistical tools that meet challenges in current development of prediction models with high dimensional predictors using noisy data from electronic medical records augmented by a small amount of gold standard outcomes. By providing statistical tools that enable clinical investigators to effectively develop accurate and interpretable risk prediction models, this proposal will join prior and ongoing research activities towards the goal of finding efficient and cost effective personalized disease management strategies.",Semi-supervised Approaches to Denoising Electronic Health Records Data for Risk

"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,10075985,R01NR016423,"['Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' cost ', ' information display ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' health assessment ', ' Grain ', ' functional independence ', ' Home ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Privacy ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Family member ', ' Self Management ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' fitness ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,474296
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,10136081,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Heart ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachea ', ' Trachea Proper ', ' windpipe ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' fetal diagnosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' model design ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning network ', ' Data Science ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' heart defect ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' data curation ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical center ', ' detection test ', ' detection tests ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,821265
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,10453863,R00LM012926,"['Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' operation ', ' network architecture ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care costs ', ' readmission risk ', ' re-admission risk ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' data complexity ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2021,236550
"Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. This includes patients admitted to intensive care units with primary neurologic diagnoses, those at increased risk based on their underlying disease (e.g. neurotropic viral infections including COVID19), and those where the development of neuromorbidity is occult and unexpected. Neuromorbidity associated with critical illness can be caused by physiologic instability, biochemical derangements, side effects of medications, invasive mechanical support, immobility, and/or other therapies used to prevent death. It spans the age spectrum from neonates to the elderly, occurs across gender and race, and is underrecognized in patients with systemic illnesses (e.g. sepsis, viral infections, and other inflammatory conditions) and critical organ failure (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, hepatic and renal failure). In the U.S. the incidence of neuromorbidity ranges from 5-47% in critically ill children and adults, thus impacting hundreds of thousands of patients annually. Often neuromorbidity evolves undetected until after clinical manifestations emerge and is irreversible. Neuromorbidity can strike acutely, e.g. seizures, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and/or delirium, or in a more protracted fashion, e.g. neuromuscular weakness and/or cognitive decline, and is often permanent, endured throughout the remainder of a person’s lifetime. No standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and many other organs.  To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we developed a Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity (BRAIN) that continuously feeds electronic health record (EHR) variables in 9 clinical domains (A through I) into proprietary informatics and machine learning platforms. Prototype BRAIN A-I models are robust and predict clinician concern for neuromorbidity before clinical action is taken. To link biological and digital signatures, we have defined a panel of serum biomarkers that can identify time-documented neuromorbidity before clinical detection. Using a “Bayesian to Bedside” approach, we have created a live data pipeline bridging the EHR and a dedicated host server, establishing the infrastructure necessary to operationalize BRAIN A-I as an embedded predictive analytic and decision-driving support tool.  In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that digital signatures in the EHR coupled with brain-specific biomarkers can rapidly detect neuromorbidity in critically ill children. Successful deployment of interoperable, 24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity would represent a breakthrough for the clinical management of critically ill patients. The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic.

"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers The population burden of cirrhosis is rising especially related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol- induced liver disease (ALD) and in those living with HIV. The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure. The studies will have a major positive impact by: (1) providing robust outcomes data, (2) supporting mechanistic studies, (3) use of innovations to refine application of NITs, (4) model clinical outcome risk to inform future monitoring strategies, and (5) provide a treatment to slow this progression, thereby providing a way to reduce the burden of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis, which is the end-stage of liver injury can lead to complications and death, but it is difficult to predict which patients are at risk and therefore, to prevent them from happening. As part of this multi-center study, we aim to collect data and samples from hundreds of patients with cirrhosis and follow them over time to better define who is at greater risk for progression. We will also participate in a trial to prevent progression of disease in which a cholesterol- lowering medication, which has positive effects on liver disease, will be compared to placebo in a large group of patients with cirrhosis.",Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Centers,10308126,U01DK130134,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', '

"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer.

"Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention"" Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention Project Summary/Abstract Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 200 million people worldwide. Peripheral vascular interventions (PVI) are the most common procedures that are performed to manage PAD. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of patient outcomes after PVIs all had limited follow-up lengths due to difficulties in long-term data collections. In addition, heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) for stent placement vs. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone has not been well understood with the current approach of effect modifier assessment. Real-world data (RWD), particularly registries linked with electronic health data (EHR), are useful for studying long-term outcomes after vascular procedures. However, methods for working with multiple data sources and analyzing unstructured text data are still evolving. The proposed research aims to address current evidence gaps in long-term patient outcomes after PVI procedures. This will be facilitated by innovatively apply and refine data linkage, natural language processing (NLP), and effect modifier assessment methods. Specifically, this project will link registry and EHR data to 1) examine long-term major adverse limb events after stent placement vs. PTA alone as well as assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by patient characteristics; 2) develop an NLP pipeline with machine learning methods to analyze unstructured text data and examine long-term efficacy endpoints after stent placement vs. PTA alone, and; 3) establish feasibility and updating requirements for the deployment of the NLP tool for long-term PVI outcome assessment to other institutions. To support the research activities and the transition toward independence, the candidate will undertake the following career development activities during the award period: 1) gaining an in- depth understanding of NLP and machine learning methods; 2) refining data science expertise to integrate EHR into medical device epidemiologic research; 3) strengthening knowledge in current and novel vascular disease treatment; 4) developing and improving skills in grant writing and academic leadership; 5) training in responsible conduct of research. The candidate will be mentored by a team of experts with complementary strengths in surgical and device outcomes research, natural language processing and machine learning, and vascular disease and surgery. The proposed career development and research activities will develop the candidate's skillset and expertise and lead to an R01 level application. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher focusing on the development and application of advanced multidisciplinary methods in the evaluation of surgical and device outcomes in the vascular disease area, supporting clinical, patient, and regulatory decision-making. Project narrative The proposed research will evaluate long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease and assess heterogeneity of treatment effect. These will be supported by implementing and advancing data linkage, natural language processing, and effect modifier assessment methods for vascular research. The proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to foster fundamental knowledge generation and innovative research strategies that will ultimately help protect and improve health.","Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention""",10283367,K01HL159315,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Balloon Angioplasty ', ' Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Arterial Dilatation ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Device ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stents ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' electronic structure ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' multiple data sources ', ' unstructured data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,162252
"Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is a disease that results in irreversible blindness and due to its chronic, progressive nature, imposes a psychosocial burden on patients. Appropriately, the focus of ophthalmologists is on controlling the disease to prevent vision loss. Yet, patient’s psychosocial distress during and after therapy has not been routinely addressed and is another important target of care. Psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) negatively impacts all outcomes in glaucoma and is associated with poor follow-up and medication adherence, worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, and faster rates of visual field progression. Direct assessment and treatment of psychosocial distress is likely to improve glaucoma outcomes. While uncommon in glaucoma clinics, psychosocial distress screening has been occurring with some consistency in other medical settings (e.g., oncology) for more than a decade, leading to referrals for intervention and improvements in psychosocial distress and subsequently overall health. Our overarching scientific premise is that a screening program for psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in glaucoma clinics would enhance the patient’s adherence to medical recommendations, and quality-of-life, ultimately leading to improvements in vision-related outcomes (e.g., visual field progression). Patient-reported outcome measures are the gold standard measures of distress, however are not routinely collected in patients with glaucoma due to perceived time and cost burdens. To remedy this, the PI proposes an automated pre-screening framework, motivated by preliminary analyses that demonstrate that distress can be reliably identified using predictive modeling based on glaucoma clinical risk factors from electronic health records (EHR) data. This predictive model will be developed in aim 1 using an existing EHR database, the Duke Glaucoma Registry, and will yield automated risk estimates of distress that can be used to inform clinical decision making, regarding the administration of a distress survey; therefore, limiting distress assessment to a subset of high-risk patients. Secondary aims will focus on external validation of the automated technique, and gauging acceptability to distress screening in a glaucoma clinic (aim 2), and the refinement of a behavioral intervention to improve coping skills for distress in patients with glaucoma (aim 3). This research will positively impact patient well- being in glaucoma, serving as an evidence-based assessment of a distress screening program. The proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of the award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Felipe Medeiros, and multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Tamara Somers (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences), Dr. David Page (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics), and Dr. Kevin Weinfurt (Population Health Sciences). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will provide the PI with highly sought-after skills and experiences to help ensure a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychosocial distress is a common comorbidity associated with the glaucoma experience and left untreated can contribute to worse outcomes, including worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, faster rates of visual field progression, and poor follow-up and medication adherence, and glaucoma comprehension. The work described in this proposal will introduce and validate an automated assessment and treatment screening program for distress in glaucoma, through innovative predictive modeling of existing healthcare and research database systems. The outcome of this project will shed light on the importance of recognizing distress in the course of glaucoma clinical care, and provide evidence to support new approaches and paradigms to assess and treat glaucoma-induced distress.",Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm,10282287,K99EY033027,"['Algorithms ', '

"EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals. Project Summary/Abstract Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating, researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity. With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the eating activity without collecting unnecessary information. To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments. We will compare the performance of this algorithm against both real-time user response and 24-hour dietary recall to objectively evaluate the algorithm's performance. Our proposed system will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions for behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Monitoring an individual's eating behavior will provide detailed understanding of the causal relationship between the eating activity and conditions such as problematic eating and obesity. Manual self-reports are often erroneous and biased. The availability of wearable video cameras makes it possible to objectively capture the eating activity. However, manually observing video frames to obtain the objective measure of eating is burdensome. Additionally, wearable video cameras pose privacy concerns in real-world settings. To overcome these challenges, we are developing an automated eating detection system to monitor real-time eating behavior via a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals will wear. We will confirm eating activities in real time. Such automatic and privacy-conscious real-time eating detection will allow us to advance our understanding of the eating activity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals.,10280789,R01DK129843,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Bite ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Ear ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Crystalline Lens ', ' Eye Lens ', ' Ocular Lens ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Locales ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' food consumption ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,701652
"Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach Project Summary Patients with epilepsy have a 25-fold elevated risk of sudden death. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common disease-related cause of premature mortality in people with seizure disorders, affecting 1 of every 1000 patients annually. Despite this, mechanisms and risk factors of SUDEP remain largely unknown. Having ongoing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and no nocturnal supervision are the only definite risk factors, and reducing seizures is the only currently available preventive strategy. Several other clinical factors and potential biomarkers such as prolonged post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) that follows GTCS, abnormal inter-ictal ECG, and structural brain MRI abnormalities were associated with increased SUDEP risk, but none were rigorously confirmed in a large case-control study. While limitations of single-center studies in accumulating a sufficient number of cases are well recognized, prospective multicenter studies are also severely limited by the time, expense, and loss of follow-up constraining sample size and power. To sidestep these limitations, we propose a retrospective multisite case-control study that will screen >40,000 patients from 86 epilepsy monitoring centers worldwide, with a conservative expected total of >185 SUDEP cases and 370 age/sex-matched controls. Employing our comprehensive approaches to identify SUDEP cases combined with novel data harmonization techniques will allow us to: 1) provide an unprecedentedly large curated dataset of SUDEP, 2) identify clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging predictors of SUDEP using advanced machine learning methods, and 3) develop an individualized model to predict SUDEP risk that can be used in clinic. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that SUDEP cases exhibit different electroclinical and imaging characteristics that can provide an individualized prediction model. We will identify ictal electroclinical and interictal electrophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDEP. We will compare markers of seizure severity between SUDEP cases and age/sex-matched living epilepsy patients, including decerebrate or decorticate posturing during GTCS, PGES duration, postictal bradycardia + asystole and post-convulsive central apnea. Additionally, we will assess putative interictal biomarkers including decreased low frequency power in ECG heart rate variability and decreased MRI-derived volumes in the right hippocampus/amygdala and brainstem. We will also employ machine-learning techniques to uncover novel biomarkers from interictal electrophysiological data. Finally, using a Bayesian framework, we will develop an individualized SUDEP risk prediction tool that combines clinical features with measures derived from routine EEG, ECG, and MRI. Our goal is to create a SUDEP case-control dataset to identify clinical risk factors and biomarkers that will help to create a robust model of an individual’s SUDEP risk based on measures derived from routine clinical care and testing such as interictal ECG, MRI and EEG. Such a tool could transform clinical practice, facilitate trials of SUDEP interventions, and ultimately save lives. Project Narrative One in 1000 people with epilepsy die every year due to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Identifying risk factors associated with SUDEP remains challenging due to the lack of large controlled datasets enabling rigorous analyses and development of comprehensive prediction models. Our study will address this critical unmet need by screening records of >40,000 patients from >85 epilepsy centers worldwide to obtain a nearly order of magnitude more cases and controls than any prior study, and applying innovative methods to test candidate biomarkers, leading to better understanding of SUDEP mechanisms and developing individualized risk models to better target patients for counseling and interventions.",Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach,10290017,R01NS123928,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic -

"Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children with cerebral palsy. Abstract/summary Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children  with cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood, but it is highly  heterogeneous with respect to its severity, response to therapy, care needs, and impact on wellness  for the child and family. To optimize health and wellness throughout life and enable new research  avenues to be effectively tested, it is critical to develop a comprehensive clinical care and  biopsychosocial data model. Development of a comprehensive model would both accelerate and improve  understanding, care, and further research, including the identification of novel targets for  interventions. The overriding objective of this proposal is to develop a precision health model for CP-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will individualize care. To accomplish this objective, we will automate the collection, cleaning, and integration of multi-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-cohort based ""big data"" extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), and combine this EHR data with prospectively  collected, high-resolution clinical, functional, environmental and psychosocial data. The focus of this proposal will be on children between ages 6 and 12 years. Preliminary work indicates that the medical center provides care for  approximately 1,800 patients with CP who are between the ages of 6 and 12 years and have at least  three years of EHR data. From this EHR cohort, we will prospectively recruit 200 children and their  families for detailed phenotyping. Recruitment will be stratified by Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) Levels: 60%  GMFCS I, II, or III (able to walk) and 40% GMFCS IV or V (use a wheelchair). Using this  multi-cohort design will allow for robust characterization of multi-dimensional factors that impact care receipt, functional  outcomes, quality of life and participation. Aim 1 will focus on creating a diverse and comprehensive data repository  using both retrospective and prospective data to characterize actual versus optimal care (defined  by current evidence-based literature). Aim 2 will lead to development of a receipt of care  coefficient score and characterize how the degree of optimal care relates to function, quality of  life and participation, controlling for functional status and age. [Models developed in Aim 2 will  be translated into a clinical decision tool prototype. Aim 3 will demonstrate proof of concept for  scalability of machine learning algorithms with the PEDSnet Learning Health System. This project  innovatively combines retrospective EHR data with prospective clinical data to elucidate  individual, treatment, family, and environmental factors associated with greater receipt of  evidence-based care and/or better outcomes. This project will move the field toward precision  medicine for CP and create a foundation for development of clinical dashboards to optimize practice.] Project Narrative The proposed project innovatively applies machine learning methods to retrospective electronic  health record and prospective clinical data to develop a precision health model for cerebral  palsy-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will  individualize care. This project will move the field toward precision medicine for cerebral palsy  and create a foundation for development of electronic health record-based clinical practice tools.

"Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) Project Summary/Abstract Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and highly morbid condition. Nearly 25% of patients die within 3 years of diagnosis, likely due to a high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events: myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. A significantly larger proportion experience disability due to leg pain, poor mobility and amputation. The cost of PAD-related hospital care alone exceeds $21 billion. However, research regarding long-term survival, CV, and limb outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments remain limited in large part due to the poor accuracy of PAD diagnosis codes. Our team has developed a novel approach using natural language processing (NLP) to identify PAD patients with a high degree of accuracy within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Significance: The Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) study will advance scientific knowledge for PAD in several ways. We will use our NLP tool to assemble one of the largest cohorts of PAD in the world and follow them long-term to assess the trajectory of survival and clinical outcomes, evaluate utilization of recommended treatments (medications, risk factor control and revascularization) and the association of above treatments with the above outcomes. Collectively, our work will address important gaps in PAD research and yield insights regarding strategies to improve care delivery in this high-risk population. Innovation: The use of an informatics-based method to assemble a cohort of newly diagnosed PAD patients in a large integrated health system is highly innovative. We believe that our approach for cohort identification will be transformational and promote big data analytics for research, improving care delivery, and future clinical trials. Specific Aims: A1. Develop a national cohort of Veterans with newly diagnosed PAD using a novel NLP algorithm. A2. Examine patterns of medical and invasive management and determine patient- and facility-level correlates. A3. Determine the impact of medical and invasive management of PAD on long-term outcomes. Methodology: We will implement our NLP algorithm to identify patients with new PAD diagnosis in VHA during 2015-2020 and obtain data on clinical and treatment related variables. We will follow our cohort longitudinally for mortality, CV events (MI, stroke) and limb events (amputation). We will examine utilization of PAD treatments and risk factor control, identify patient-level and hospital-level predictors of treatment using multi-level models. We will use discrete survival models to evaluate the association of PAD treatments with long-term outcomes. Implementation/Next Steps: Key deliverables will include a) an understanding of which patient groups are at greatest risk for mortality and adverse outcomes; (b) determining the relative impact of PAD treatments on long- term outcomes which can be useful for decision-making and c) an assessment of site-level variation in treatment patterns. We envision that our findings will help us develop comprehensive disease management program to improve quality of care and reduce disparities in use of effective treatments. Project Narrative Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and highly morbid condition that is a major cause of leg amputation, and associated with a high risk of heart attack, stroke and death. We propose to create a large cohort of PAD patients who will be identified using a novel method developed by our research team and followed long-term to advance our understanding of the trajectory of survival and clinical outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments on patient outcomes. Our work will advance PAD research and provide important insights regarding how best to improve PAD care.",Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study

"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,10080366,K08HL141598,"['Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Consultations ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hospital Departments ', ' Information Theory ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Probability ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Weight ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' functional status ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Exercise Thallium ', ' Stress Thallium Test ', ' cardiac stress test ', ' nuclear stress test ', ' Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Perioperative ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' treatment center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' risk mitigation ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' perioperative mortality ', ' perioperative death ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2021,161047
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,10168610,R01LM013204,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Influentials ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' operation ', ' treatment choice ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' preservation ', ' unstructured data ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Data Store ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,469927
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' built environment ', ' student training ', ' webinar ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' recruit ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Future ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Measurement ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' patient registry ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Rupture ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' high risk ', ' coronary computed tomography angiography ', ' arm ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' individual patient ', ' prognostic significance ', ' coronary calcium scoring ', ' coronary artery calcium scoring ', ' coronary plaque ', ' coronary event ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Regimen ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' patient portal ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography Proposal Summary There is increasing appreciation of a syndrome in which patients female patients, present with chest pain due to myocardial ischemia and have a normal or near normal coronary angiogram. Termed coronary microvascular dysfunction (MVD) this disorder is not benign with cardiovascular event rates similar to those with established coronary artery disease. Clinical tools are therefore needed to both identify MVD patients and better understand the mechanisms causing myocardial ischemia. There is evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) provides incremental information in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, myocardial viability, or diseases of the microvasculature. Despite data demonstrating the diagnostic and prognostic benefit of MCE in evaluating patients with MVD, its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field, because there are currently no widely available clinical tools to support MCE quantitative analysis and interpretation. The overall aim of this Phase I proposal is to provide clinicians with a new tool to evaluate the myocardial flow-function relationship that is critical to identifying patients with MVD by using echocardiography. We will develop clinical software that can rapidly process MCE data into a standardized, quantitative and easy- to- interpret format. In Aim 1, the power of image averaging and computer aided assessment of radial wall thickening will be used to enhance the current standard of care which relies solely on readers' visual estimation of segmental function. An algorithm will be developed to rearrange the order of images so that images representing the same phase of the cardiac cycle are grouped together. Functional analysis will then be developed using computer-aided tracings of epicardial and endocardial borders. In Aim 2, a software module for quantitative analysis of real-time MCE perfusion will be developed that will incorporate statistical confidence, derived from the performance of image processing algorithms to inform the interpreter about the data strength. Machine learning will be utilized to train and deploy a neural network for the pixel-by-pixel assessment of myocardial perfusion. In Aim 3, we will combine myocardial perfusion and function modules into a novel, perfusion-function mode of imaging (PF-mode). This new mode will be applied to an archival sample of clinically diagnosed MVD cases to demonstrate the feasibility to detect abnormalities in the myocardial flow-function relationship. The composite PF-mode will include a cine-loop rendered for one cardiac cycle where parametric images (perfusion) are superimposed over averaged ultrasound images with an overlay of graphic representation of wall thickness (function). This novel mode of imaging provides the means to diagnose MVD in a single clinical study. Project Narrative Project Title: Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography Despite a wealth of evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography imaging of myocardial perfusion provides incremental information in the evaluation of patients with diseases of the myocardial microvasculature (MVD), its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field. In this proposal, we have created a multidisciplinary partnership between physicians-scientists and engineers with the overall aim to address this clinical gap that exists between a proven echocardiographic technique and the technology necessary to enable widespread adoption of MCE clinically. We will develop a software program enabling a new method for evaluating the myocardial flow-function relationship using echocardiography that will enable the identification of MVD using MCE studies at the level of expert readers.",Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography,10155647,R43HL152939,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' arteriole ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Flow Velocity ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Color ', ' Computers ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Contrast Echocardiography ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Female ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rest ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Vendor ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Guidelines ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Apical ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Process ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user-friendly ', ' standard of care ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' imaging software ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' parametric imaging ', ' neural network ', ' sample archive ', ' ']",NHLBI,"NARNAR, LLC",R43,2021,235887
"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Confidential Information ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Lipids ', ' Logic ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Names ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' San Francisco ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' processing speed ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Exclusion ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Seminal ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' commercial application ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Euclidean Space ', ' 3-Dimensional Euclidean Space ', ' Euclidean 3D Distance ', ' Euclidean 3D Space ', ' Euclidean Distance ', ' Euclidean Feature Space ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' blood pressure intervention ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' ']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,669143
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population.

"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability.

"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10051418,R01ES029950,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Conditioning ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Humidity ', ' indexing ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Local Government ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Temperature ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Government Officials ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' public health emergency ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' extreme heat ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' statistical learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,627397
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,10137995,K01HL136687,"['Affect ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Records ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Resolution ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' prospective ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Prevention trial ', ' health data ', ' respiratory health ', ' Data Science ', ' phenotypic data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' risk prediction model ', ' statistical learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' participant enrollment ', ' patient enrollment ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172704
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' lower income families ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' circadian ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Traumatic Hemorrhage ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Melons ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' simulation ', ' Agreement ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' advanced system ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' signal processing ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Trauma patient ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' in silico ', ' data streams ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Perioperative Care ', ' Custom ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Nurse Anesthesiologist ', ' Nurse Anesthetists ', ' Certified registered nurse anesthetist ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' Network-based ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' health information technology ', ' waiver ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Patient risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' postoperative delirium ', ' post-operative delirium ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' implementation framework ', ' implementation research framework ', ' implementation science framework ', ' remote monitoring ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10267036,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,127961
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10266125,R01AG069734,"['Academic

"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in newly created arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas that are unlikely to mature in patients who need surgical intervention to achieve successful maturation. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of newly created AVF sounds from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with AVFs likely to mature and patients with AVFs unlikely to mature. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring of the maturation process for newly created fistulas. During Phase I of the project, we will recruit study subjects in access centers at the University of North Carolina (UNC). SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' AV fistula ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Auscultation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Fistula ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart Sounds ', ' Cardiac Sounds ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Nephrology ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' patient home care ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Distal ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' analog ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Eko ', ' skills ', ' Study Subject ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' systematic review ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Network-based ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' cloud software ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' cloud based ', ' recruit ', ' Bluetooth ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' data streams ', ' algorithm training ', ' Home ', ' arteriovenous graft ', ' ']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,279774
"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse. BehaVR, LLC will meet this need by translating an evidence-based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD that will increase accessibility to services to improve the patient's chances of long-term treatment success.",Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder,10255561,R44DA053848,"['Affect ', ' Back ', '

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! !

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10239049,R01CA251566,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' thyroid neoplasm ', ' Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Thyroid Gland Tumor ', ' Thyroid Tumor ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Papillary thyroid carcinoma ', ' Papillary Thyroid Cancer ', ' Papillary Thyroid Gland Cancer ', ' Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' tumor growth ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Provider ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' remote laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' side effect ', ' Patient imaging ', ' unethical ', ' dissemination strategy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,517978
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10238838,R61AG068947,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' discounting ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' intervention cost ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' screening disparities ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,294241
"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,10248299,F31LM013403,"['Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Police ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' health equity ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10372247,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Veterans ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' ICD Code ', ' International Classification of Disease Codes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' treatment strategy ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' phenome ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic information ', ' interactive tool ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient variability ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' genetic architecture ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,325000
"HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets PROJECT SUMMARY  The Overarching Aim of the Northwestern HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment targets is to provide overall management and oversight for HeartShare, including coordination and communication across all subsections and cores of the program, and with the 4 HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs).

"Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden Project Summary Globally, Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death and a particular concern in countries with a high HIV burden. With only 57% of cases being successfully treated, multi-drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB) has become a substantial barrier to TB control. High rates of loss to follow up (LTFU) (i.e., missing two or more consecutive months of treatment) are a major contributor to the low MDR-TB treatment success rates. LTFU may lead to additional antibiotic resistance, MDR-TB treatment failure, and death. The World Health Organization recommends that patients at-risk for LTFU be given priority attention, but there is currently no evidence-based way to identify these patients. In order to address this gap, the proposed study will develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment based on characteristics present at treatment initiation. If accurate, this model will identify the patients who are at high-risk for LTFU and who will draw the greatest benefit from interventions that promote care engagement and retention. Although the reasons for LTFU are complex, past research has yielded a number of potential predictors that will inform the proposed prediction model, including male sex, age, housing instability, alcohol use, substance use, employment status, education level, rural residence, and prior episode(s) of TB. In addition to factors present at treatment initiation, the relationship between LTFU and factors that change throughout treatment, including adverse treatment events and treatment regimen, will be examined to develop a broader understanding of MDR-TB care engagement. The proposed study will be nested within the control arm of a cluster-randomized trial of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (R01 AI104488). The specific aims of the proposed study, titled “Understanding and Predicting Loss to Follow-up from MDR-TB Treatment in the Setting of High-HIV Burden”, are to conduct a nested, retrospective cohort study among patients who were LTFU or successfully completed MDR-TB treatment (i.e., cured or completed treatment) to: (1a) develop a prediction model for LTFU from MDR-TB care based on the patient characteristics available at treatment initiation utilizing LASSO regression and k-fold cross-validation; (1b) adapt the prediction model developed in Aim 1a into a tool that can be used by providers at the point of care to estimate a patient’s risk for LTFU; (1c) determine if type of treatment regimen is a risk factor for LTFU and if it improves the fit of the prediction model developed in Aim 1a; and (2) examine the relationship between LTFU and the timing and burden of adverse treatment effects. This study will be the first to take a predictive modeling approach to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying patients at high-risk for LTFU and prioritizing their receipt of support services in order to ultimately improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings. Through the proposed study and training plan, the applicant will gain experience analyzing large, complex longitudinal data and applying machine learning to optimize patient engagement and clinical care. Narrative The World Health Organization estimates that 16% of all multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients are lost to follow up (LTFU), placing them at increased risk for treatment failure, death, and the development of additional resistance to antituberculosis medications. Despite mounting knowledge about the risk factors for LTFU from MDR-TB treatment and the End TB Strategy directive that patients at-risk for suboptimal treatment success be given priority attention, there is currently no evidence-based method that allows for the early identification of patients at-risk for being lost from care. The proposed study will use a nested retrospective cohort design to develop a model for predicting LTFU from MDR-TB treatment that can ultimately be used to guide MDR-TB providers in identifying

"Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies Project Summary / Abstract According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), early detection and timely treatment can reduce the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic retinopathy (DR) by 95%. Yet, DR remains the leading cause of blindness among American adults. By 2030, 54.9 million Americans are expected to have diabetes. The prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes is 4.4% and 10.2% in the US and worldwide, respectively, representing over 28 million people at risk of blindness. Because DR causes no pain, vision loss, or other symptoms at its early stages and only 50% of people with diabetes receive annual eye exams, many will be unaware of their disease until vision loss is irreversible. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI) believes that the root cause of this public health failure is more behavioral and educational than clinical; complete adherence to screening and treatment would prevent nearly all vision loss from DR. However, 100% adherence is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective. Eliminating blindness from DR requires a strategy shift that acknowledges that preventing vision loss from DR does not require a 100% annual screening rate; it requires only that all patients with VTDR are evaluated by an eye care provider and adhere to follow up recommendations. RCI's approach to cost-effectively eliminating blindness from DR is to prioritize patients who are most likely to require immediate attention and devote the resources necessary to ensure they are evaluated by an eye care provider. The proposed project is designed to accomplish this goal through VTDR risk prediction; targeted patient engagement, education, and behavioral interventions; and optimization of the full system to achieve maximum population benefit. In Aim 1, RCI will leverage our existing Data Repository and machine learning methods to predict VTDR risk using electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare insurance claims data, with the initial goal of correctly placing over 90% of patients with VTDR in the highest-risk half of the population when ordered by risk. In doing so, RCI can focus patient engagement resources on patients who are most likely to need immediate evaluation and treatment, rather than diverting resources to patients who are less likely to require immediate attention. In Aim 2, RCI will use mixed methods framed by the Integrated Behavior Model to identify barriers and motivators for screening and assess their relative importance, develop and implement a survey instrument to elicit willingness to participate in screening based on motivating factors and barrier removal, and use natural language processing to detect barriers and facilitators for diabetic eye screening from patient communications. In Aim 3, RCI will create an agent-based simulation tool to guide care coordination recommendations in a way that maximizes population health outcomes subject to constraints on time and cost. The tool will identify optimal intervention strategies and be adaptable to changes in cost, disease burden, patient preference, population characteristics, and other parameters. Decisions that will be optimized include resource allocation as a function of risk, intervention timing, screening modality, communication strategies, barrier removal strategies, and other modifiable aspects of the system. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is expected to affect over 11 million people in the US by 2030 and is the leading cause of blindness in American adults, despite vision loss being almost entirely preventable with timely detection and treatment. To prevent blindness from DR, the Retinal Care-DR program is designed to eliminate the deficiencies of the current care delivery model by implementing a first-of-its-kind, personalized care coordination program guided by individual disease risk and population-level outcomes. This will be accomplished through the application of machine learning to prioritize patients for care coordination by disease risk, development of tools to identify and understand the impact of barriers and motivators for diabetic eye screening for high risk patients, and care coordination decision logic guided by agent-based simulation to maximize population health outcomes subject to financial constraints.",Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies,10324935,R44EY033251,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Mayo Clinic HeartShare Clinical Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the NIH HeartShare Research Consortium as a HeartShare Clinical Center (CC). Our goal is to collaborate with the other HeartShare Investigators to elucidate the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and discover novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Multiple pathophysiologic processes may ultimately lead to different HFpEF phenotypes, though the specific mechanisms remain largely undefined. It is also not known whether standard clinical information can identify patients with different mechanistic etiologies, which is necessary to provide targeted therapies in clinical trials and eventually in clinical practice. Our proposal outlines four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1: We document that Mayo Clinic has the resources and the Mayo HeartShare Team has the expertise and track record of productivity in HFpEF and relevant related diseases, clinical research, patient recruitment and retention, data science, and collaborative team science to help drive the success of HeartShare Network. In Specific Aim 2: We propose a broad mechanistic phenotyping protocol providing quantitative variables reflective of senescence, systemic disease processes, and multi-organ integrity (L2 data), which are used as input variables in unsupervised machine learning (ML) models. We hypothesize that this approach will allow identification of unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroups (clusters). We also propose invasive hemodynamic signatures, trans-cardiac gradients of circulating biomarkers and myocardial, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue characterization (L3 data) be obtained in a subset within each HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroup. We hypothesize these L3 data will enhance identification of targeted therapeutic strategies. Lastly, we outline supervised ML using EHR data to develop automatable algorithms to accurately identify the HeartShare HFpEF pathophysiological phenogroups derived using L2 data. We hypothesize that if successful, this approach will enhance translation of HeartShare findings by allowing automated identification of patients in the different HFpEF phenogroups for enrollment in clinical trials of agents targeting their specific pathophysiology. In Specific Aim 3: We propose that use of circulating proteins alone (n=5000; defined by the SOMAScanTM Aptamer based platform) as input variables for unsupervised ML models will identify unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenotypes (clusters). In Specific Aim 4: We outline the Mayo HeartShare Research Skills Development Program. Providing HFpEF clinical investigators a short-term intensive immersion experience by collaboration with a data scientist intern in the Mayo Cardiovascular Disease AI Internship or a long term dedicated program in data science as a Mayo Kern Center Scholar in Data Science will equip a new generation of HFpEF investigators with a robust data science toolbox to drive future discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ LAY SUMMARY This proposal represents Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the HeartShare Research Consortium, a program established by the National Institutes of Health.

"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are data- driven approaches looking for patterns in massive datasets. While the AI/ ML algorithms rapidly advanced and built successful imaging processing applications, the promise of AI/ML in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance research remains largely unfulfilled. The main reasons stem from deficient, inaccessible and poorly labeled clinical data allowing for only a small portion of the electronic health records (EHR) data to be used. More so, clinical narratives such as notes and imaging reports which contain unstructured data elements in free text format are almost never used. Our parent K08 award aims to identify sepsis phenotypes at risk for MDR GNB that will enable better antibiotic prescribing practices and standardize comparisons across hospitals. We propose to accomplish our goal by leveraging big data and using innovative methods such as ML methods. This supplement will strengthen our project by analyzing in detail the barriers to efficiently using EHR data including unstructured data elements and providing data engineering solutions. The objective is to provide the framework for ML use in sepsis research. Demonstrating reproducibility and rigor of our ML methods and making the algorithms and datasets accessible per FAIR and TRUST principles will be responsive to NIGMS and broader NIH priorities. Our aims reflect these priorities: 1) Analyze barriers to use of EHR structured data and provide data engineering solutions for data enrichment, 2) Extract and assess the importance of unstructured data in developing ML sepsis models, and 3) Compare the ML sepsis models using unstructured and structured data VS structured data only and ensure algorithm fairness by testing it across subgroups of interest based on gender and race. We will incorporate clinical data from the 15 hospitals in our healthcare system serving an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population in rural, suburban and urban hospitals. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in sepsis research. This supplement complements and broadens the initial K08 award. It serves as the natural next step in deepening her expertise in innovative methods. This supplement will provide the opportunity for meaningful collaborations with data scientists with ample expertise in unstructured data methods and data engineers specialized in ML methods. It will help Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to promote clinically applicable algorithms for challenging problems such as sepsis treatment. For this supplement, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet will continue the collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of mentors and add data engineering support. An accredited course in unsupervised machine learning will be added to her career development plan. She will continue her path to becoming an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis with focus on data availability, the experienced mentorship team now incorporating data engineering expertise and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are critical issues. The parent K08 of Dr. Vazquez Guillamet aims to identify sepsis phenotypes at risk for MDR GNB by using mathematical models and machine learning (ML) methods.

"Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the long-term career goal of becoming a leading independent researcher using technology-driven precision medicine approaches to improve obesity outcomes in primary care, the candidate, Dr. Hallie Espel- Huynh, PhD, proposes a mentored research project and career development plan that will prepare her to use advanced analytics to personalize routine clinical care for patients with obesity. Despite the promise of online interventions to maximize access to effective behavioral obesity treatments in primary care, many patients do not benefit due to nonresponse. Evidence-based rescue interventions (EBRI) can improve outcomes for these patients, however, primary care clinicians require guidance on when and how to intervene, and such a tool does not yet exist. Clinical decision support (CDS) has the potential to fill this gap by predicting risk for nonresponse, delivering alerts about this risk to clinicians, and enabling interventions to reverse it. The overall objective of this training application is to develop such a CDS for use in primary care and test its usability with primary care clinicians. The proposal aims to (1) use stakeholder input to align the content and format of the CDS with primary care providers’ needs, (2) build a machine learning model to predict early risk for online obesity treatment nonresponse for integration into the CDS, and (3) design the prototype CDS and test its usability with primary care clinicians, focusing on outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness for the target primary care setting. This project is the first to combine precise nonresponse risk prediction with stakeholder-informed CDS to produce a tool that has the potential to maximize obesity treatment outcomes in primary care via delivery of CDS-facilitated, clinician-delivered rescue interventions. This research will result in a complete CDS tool that is ready for future clinical testing with patients in primary care, and which could greatly enhance the potential impact of online obesity treatment in this setting. The research plan is complemented by career development activities that include formal training in technology-assisted obesity and CVD management in primary care, stakeholder-centered CDS development, machine learning, and mixed methods for patient-oriented implementation research. Under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, execution of the proposed research and training plan will lead Dr. Espel-Huynh to submission of a competitive R01 grant application to test CDS effectiveness in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Behavioral treatment for obesity is being disseminated online to at-risk patients in primary care, yet high levels of nonresponse limit its potential public health impact. The proposed research aims to use stakeholder input to develop a clinical decision support tool that guides clinicians to efficiently and effectively intervene on obesity treatment nonresponse, which will ultimately improve obesity treatment outcomes and reduce weight-related cardiovascular disease risk.",Maximizing Online Obesity Treatment Response in the Primary Care Environment Using Clinical Decision Support,10301403,K23HL155733,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Weight ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' i(19) ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' implementation research ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical effect ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' routine care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' treatment risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' clinical center ', ' online intervention ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K23,2021,187418
"Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record Project Summary/Abstract Over half of adult Americans use dietary supplements. However, little is known about their safety and effectiveness as these products are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and post-marketing surveillance is limited to adverse events. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) seeks to fill in that gap and has identified electronic health record (EHR) data as a potential tool to advance that goal. Preliminary data from our pilot study sponsored by the NIH ODS that used advanced machine/deep learning techniques suggest that magnesium supplements may lower the risk of heart failure (HF) in patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) and may improve outcomes in those with HF. Both HF and DM affect the health and outcomes of millions of Americans. DM is a risk factor for HF and adversely affects outcomes in those with HF. Magnesium is an integral part of over 300 human enzyme systems, which are impaired in magnesium deficiency. Findings from our study suggest that a low dietary magnesium intake is associated with a higher risk of incident HF, especially among those with DM. However, less is known about this relationship in patients with HF. The Specific Aims 1 and 2 of the proposed projects are to test the hypotheses that a new prescription for oral magnesium supplement is associated with a lower risk of incident HF in those with DM and of mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF. Although magnesium is inexpensive and relatively safe, its long-term effects may vary for individual patients. Thus, instead of recommending it to millions of patients, it would be ideal to recommend to individuals who are most likely to benefit. Thus, our Specific Aim 3 is to develop and validate a novel explainable deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine with precision the optimal clinical setting under which an individual may derive clinical benefits from magnesium supplementation given their individual characteristics including multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These aims will be achieved by interrogating the Veterans Affairs (VA) national EHR data that includes over 2 million Veterans with DM and 1 million with HF with ~20 years of longitudinal data on magnesium supplements, serum magnesium, and outcomes. We will use a new-user design, marginal structural model (propensity score weighting) with machine- learning-based estimation and stability analyses to minimize confounding and account for potential biases. The prediction model for individual risk/benefit will be validated using the Cerner Health Facts® data for generalizability in non-Veteran populations. The findings of proposed study will generate new evidence that will have direct clinical implications and those of Aim 3 specifically will provide a novel precision medicine tool to individualize magnesium supplement use. Project Narrative About 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure and one third of the patients with heart failure die within a year of the diagnosis. While lower blood magnesium levels have been linked with the incident and outcomes of heart failure, it is unknown whether magnesium supplements (~$0.05 each pill) may lower that risk. We propose to interrogate national electronic health record data from Veterans Health Administration using novel pharmacoepidemiology methodology and develop explainable deep-learning models to help clinicians and patients make personalized decisions to maximize the health benefits of magnesium supplements.",Magnesium supplement and vascular health: Machine learning from the longitudinal medical record,10301239,R01HL156518,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Calcium ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Magnesium ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium Deficiency ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Serum magnesium level observed ', ' Serum Magnesium Level ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Clinical ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' dietary supplements ', ' diet supplement ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' pill ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' active comparator ', ' Dietary Magnesium ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' therapeutic effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' Mg supplementation ', ' Magnesium supplementation ', ' Supplementation with magnesium ', ' deep learning ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459597
"Risk stratification of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection using clinical and engineering analysis Project Summary  Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is a lethal disease which occurs when a tear develops in the inner lining (intimal layer) of the aorta, causing the layers of the aortic wall to separate (dissect) creating “true” and “false” lumens. Complicated TBADs with presence of either organ malperfusion or aortic rupture have a high in-hospital mortality rate and require emergent surgical or endovascular therapy. Uncomplicated TBADs have been traditionally managed with optimal medical therapy (OMT) consisting of aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy and surveillance imaging. OMT results in low in-hospital mortality rates, but dismal long-term survival rates of 48- 66%, and overall intervention-free survival rates of less than 50% secondary to aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. These poor long-term outcomes support a paradigm change in the treatment of the uncomplicated TBADs. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need for promptly identifying those uncomplicated TBAD patients that will likely fail OMT in the acute phase, and thus benefit from early intervention such as Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR).  Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a risk stratification model for predicting both failure of OMT and the optimal timing of intervention in uncomplicated TBAD patients. To achieve this goal, a retrospective analysis will be conducted for about 500 uncomplicated TBAD patients from the Emory Aortic Databank. Clinical and anatomic data will be harvested from the electronic medical record and image studies to identify predictors of OMT failure. Next, using the same patient database, a series of mechanical experiments will be performed to obtain hyperelastic and failure properties of the TBAD tissues, from which rupture/tear risk metrics will be developed. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses will be validated and applied to obtain “heat maps” of hemodynamic and wall stress fields. The risk indices will be consequently extracted. For patients with longitudinal imaging data, TBAD progression will be predicted using an integrated growth and remodeling (G&R) and dissection propagation model. Critical biomechanical parameters will be identified as potential predictors of OMT failure. Finally, machine learning (ML) techniques will be used to combine clinical and biomechanical predictors to develop a multi-factorial, personalized TBAD risk stratification model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we will recruit and perform a longitudinal follow-up study of 35 acute uncomplicated TBAD patients to validate our approach by comparing the ML-model- prediction results with actual clinical outcomes.

"Integrating Volumetric Light-Field with Computational Fluid Dynamics to Study Myocardial Trabeculation and Function ABSTRACT Integrating Volumetric Light-Field with Computational Fluid Dynamics to Study Myocardial Trabeculation and Function Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) is a disease of endomyocardial trabeculation or known as spongy myocardium. NCC carries a high risk of malignant arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and ventricular dysfunction in association with congenital heart defects or skeletal myopathy. Studies have linked left ventricular non-compaction with autosomal dominant inherited disorders, and mutations in Notch pathways are implicated in defective trabeculation and ventricular NCC. Biomechanical force is intimately connected with mechanotransduction and cardiac morphogenesis. During development, the myocardium differentiates into an outer compact zone and an inner trabeculated zone. Notch receptor- ligand interaction induces EphrinB2-Nrg-ErbB2 signaling to initiate trabecular formation. Our in silico analysis (Alison Marsden, Stanford) revealed elevated oscillatory shear index (OSI) in trabecular ridges, leading to increased viscous dissipation, which was associated with changes in ventricular contractile function and remodeling. However, uncoupling myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics to elucidate Notch-mediated trabecular organization and subsequent associated changes in local hemodynamics remains an unmet biomechanical challenge. In this context, we hypothesize that hemodynamic shear and myocardial contractile forces coordinate trabecular organization needed to preserve the ventricular structure and contractile efficiency. In combination of laser light-sheet and light- field for super resolution and volumetric imaging, we simultaneously captured myocardial contraction and intracardiac flow dynamics. In collaboration with Stanford Cardiac Mechanics, we integrated fluid structure interaction (FSI) with super resolution imaging to demonstrate 4-D endocardial shear stress in the trabecular ridges and grooves as possible developmental modulator. To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that intracardiac shear stress activates endocardial Delta-Notch signaling to promote trabecular ridge formation. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that ventricular contraction activates myocardial Jagged-Notch signaling to organize trabecular groove formation. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate that the combination of trabecular ridge and groove formation leads to optimal local hemodynamics and ventricular energetics. The integration of advanced imaging, fluid structure interaction, and zebrafish genetics is uniquely suitable to unveil trabecular organization in relation to kinetic energy dissipation. Our multi-disciplinary approach provides new biomechanical insights into non-compaction cardiomyopathy with pathophysiological significance to ventricular remodeling and function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure which afflicts nearly 5 million people in the United States, and an additional 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Non-compaction (LVNC) is the third most common cardiomyopathy with an estimated prevalence from 4.5 to 26 per 10,000 adult patients referred for echocardiographic diagnosis; however, there remains a poor genotype-phenotype association in LVNC patients, and a paucity of knowledge on the biomechanical forces underlying the initiation and organization of trabeculation and compaction during cardiac development. For these reasons, our multi-disciplinary team seeks to embrace advanced optics, genetic animal models, and precise computation to provide mechanotransduction insights into the organization of cardiac trabeculation for ventricular structure and function.",Integrating Volumetric Light-Field with Computational Fluid Dynamics to Study Myocardial Trabeculation and Function,10315583,R01HL159970,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Budgets ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diastole ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' indexing ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardial Contraction ', ' heart contraction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' erbB-2 Receptor ', ' ErbB2 receptor ', ' Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' Proto-Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' erbB-2 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' neu Receptor ', ' Ventricular Function ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' ERBB2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER2 ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2/neu ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' NEU protein ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' neu Genes ', ' Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' gene interaction ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Ventricle Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Cardiac Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Myocardial Remodeling ', ' myocardial remodeling ', ' Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Structure ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' shear stress ', ' Animal Genetics ', ' Resolution ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' vector ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' Cardiac development ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Non-compaction cardiomyopathy ', ' noncompaction cardiomyopathy ', ' Left ventricular non-compaction ', ' left ventricular noncompaction ', ' spongy myocardium ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' in silico ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,510487
"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Understanding the Heterogeneity of Disease Expression and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of the myocardium that is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocyte disarray, and fibrosis. It is the most prevalent genetic heart disorder, affecting ~1 in 500 people. HCM has been the focus of intense clinical and basic science study for decades. These efforts have provided remarkable insights into the molecular basis and clinical course of disease-- defining sarcomere mutations as the most common genetic etiology and characterizing the phenotypic spectrum. Additionally, prior studies have underscored the great heterogeneity of HCM. Although many patients have serious outcomes, including arrhythmias, advanced heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, many others experience mild disease with low symptom burden and normal longevity. Moreover, there is striking diversity in cardiac morphology and function, even amongst patients with identical underlying sarcomere mutations. The factors that drive such marked heterogeneity are poorly understood, highlighting the critical need to better characterize determinants of disease expression and clinical outcomes.  This proposal seeks to identify genotypic and phenotypic features that account for the highly diverse manifestations of HCM. These goals will be addressed by leveraging the recently established Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), containing data on over 9000 HCM patients, and applying state-of- the-art genetic, imaging, and statistical analyses. Our aims are: (1) To identify common genetic variation that impacts disease expression in HCM patients both with and without a driving sarcomere mutation (sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric HCM). These analyses will interrogate background genetic variation to examine how an individual’s genetic make-up influences their susceptibility or resistance to disease. We will also develop polygenic risk scores to assess the cumulative effect of common genetic variants on disease expression. (2) To characterize phenotypic factors that influence disease expression by utilizing machine-learning techniques to identify novel, quantitative high-dimensional imaging features from routinely-performed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies. We will then incorporate these features into rigorous prediction models to improve clinical risk stratification. This approach will allow us to look more deeply into the structure and function of the heart by using the full array of digital data available from CMR imaging, thereby drawing new correlations between phenotype, disease manifestations, and clinical outcomes. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of why disease experience can be so different from patient to patient, provide new insights into mechanism and therapeutic targets, and identify novel biomarkers of disease severity. These results will impact clinical management of patients with HCM by improving the precision and accuracy of diagnosis and risk stratification. Finally, insights gained will likely inform more common forms of heart disease, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with similarly highly heterogeneous manifestations. NARRATIVE Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is heart muscle disease that can cause disabling symptoms, dangerous heart rhythm disturbances, and premature death. Mutations in the genes that encode the sarcomere, the molecular motor of the heart, are the most frequent cause of HCM, however, there is tremendous variation in disease experience from one patient to the next.

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection Project Summary Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 687,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2015 and that the HAI prevalence on a given day was one in 30 patients. An estimated 72,000 patients died with HAIs during their hospitalization. In addition, outbreaks in hospitals remain a serious problem but the vast majority of hospitals use antiquated and ineffective methods to detect them. We established the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Acquired Transmission (EDS-HAT) (R01AI127472), which combines bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance (as opposed to reactive WGS) to detect outbreaks with data mining (DM) of the electronic health record (EHR) and machine learning (ML) to identify the responsible transmission routes. We have demonstrated that EDS-HAT detects both serious outbreaks that were otherwise unrecognized and novel transmission routes. Despite this success, additional research is needed to improve upon EDS-HAT and further increase capacity to detect and interrupt hospital outbreaks. For example, hospital outbreaks of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are well documented, but this area of infection prevention is understudied. The addition of respiratory virus surveillance to EDS-HAT would improve detection and prevention of these costly HAIs. In addition, readily-available clinical microbiology data can be incorporated into EDS-HAT algorithms to reduce reliance on WGS surveillance. Finally, WGS surveillance analysis based entirely on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can falsely cluster patients. Therefore, research to investigate the contribution(s) of the accessory genome is necessary to improve discriminatory power of EDS-HAT. In this R01 renewal application, we propose to leverage the success of EDS-HAT by developing additional innovative methods for identification and interruption of hospital-associated transmission. In aim 1, we plan to use WGS surveillance and EHR DM/ML to study hospital transmission of respiratory viruses from retrospective (aim 1a) and prospective collections (aim 1b) of respiratory virus positive specimens at two large academic hospitals (EDS-HAT RV), one for adults and the other pediatric. In aim 2, we will develop advanced analytic methods to create a version of EDS-HAT that relies primarily on DM/ML of the EHR (EDS-HAT Lite) (aim 2a) and improve the discriminatory power of WGS to correctly classify patients who are part of an outbreak (aim 2b). EDS-HAT RV and EDS-HAT Lite will undergo clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the number of cases prevented and healthcare costs averted. These aims will be accomplished by a team with expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, and economic analysis and modeling. Our proposed research will lead to improved patient safety and can serve as a model for how outbreaks are detected and interrupted in hospitals. Project narrative We have demonstrated that the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS- HAT) detects serious outbreaks that are otherwise unidentified.

"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for

"Personalized Rejection Risk Assessment in Cardiac Transplantation Project Summary: Cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) is a serious concern in transplant medicine, representing the leading threat to short- and long-term allograft survival. As a result, CAR surveillance and prevention is a primary focus of post-transplant care, with recipients undergoing frequent, scheduled, surveillance endomyocar- dial biopsy (EMB) for histologic CAR grading along with frequent, scheduled de-escalation of immunosuppres- sion (IS). The uniformity of this standardized approach to CAR mitigation is the result of an inability to employ reliable, proactive, and tailored strategies based on individual CAR risk. Consequently, patients at low CAR risk are exposed to unnecessary EMB procedures and excess IS therapy, while patients at high risk experience inadequate CAR surveillance and early/inappropriate weaning of IS. This exposes patients to potential harm, and highlights the clear, unmet need for precision CAR risk-assessment tools. The overarching premise for this proposal is that contained within the clinical data and EMB tissues already collected as part of usual care at transplant centers exists the means to provide actionable CAR risk assessments. Extensive immunologic, diag- nostic, and pharmacologic data are captured in electronic health records (EHR) at transplant centers, while large collections of EMB histology samples are stored (and often digitized) in pathology archives. This proposal seeks to utilize advanced machine-learning algorithms and in-situ diagnostic methods to deeply mine these archival resources for the purpose of validating novel CAR risk-prediction models. In Aim 1, we will leverage our experi- ence with automated histologic analysis pipelines to develop a ‘morphologic model’ for predicting future CAR using archived H&E slides. Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) histology slides are generated from all EMB events as part of standard-of-care. In published and patented prior efforts, we have extracted quantitative morphologic features from digitized H&E slides which, when modeled, demonstrate excellent performance for diagnosing myocardial injury and CAR grades. In Aim 2, we will move beyond standard H&E, leveraging our experience with quantitative, in-situ immune-profiling of transplant EMBs to develop a ‘morpho-molecular’ model for predicting future CAR. This aim will expand upon exciting pilot work which showed the CAR risk-stratification potential of combining quantitative image-analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a ‘histo-informatics’ model for predicting CAR by integrating data from Aims 1 & 2 with comprehensive clinical informatics data extracted from the EHR. Ultimately, as a result of this work, we expect to validate a novel pre- cision prediction model for use in prospective investigations exploring personalized CAR surveillance and pre- vention strategies. Beyond the potential translational impact, this research plan will build on the Applicant’s knowledge of complex cohort design, integrated data modeling, and transplant immunodiagnostics. Along with planned coursework and a diverse mentoring, advisory, and collaborative team, this proposal provides the opti- mal vehicle for Dr. Peyster’s maturation into an investigator with proven expertise in multi-modality diagnostics. Project Narrative: There is considerable uniformity in the rejection surveillance and prevention protocols used in heart transplant medicine, primarily due to a lack of precision diagnostic tools for assessing individual rejection risk. The inability to provide personalized immunosuppression and biopsy schedules that are tailored to individual risk exposes patients to serious and avoidable opportunistic infections, procedural injuries, and rejection events. This proposal aims to apply advanced informatics, computer-vision, and in-situ diagnostic methods to archived clinical data and biopsy tissues in order to develop a rejection risk-prediction model

"Anticoagulant use, safety, and effectiveness for venous thromboembolism prevention in inflammatory bowel disease patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a profound need to improve venous thromboembolism [VTE] treatment and prevention, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pharmacoepidemiologist committed to improving VTE prevention and treatment in populations who are often excluded or vastly under-represented in randomized clinical trials [RCTs]. Of the 3 million Americans affected by IBD, ~1–7% will develop VTE, a significant source of morbidity and mortality, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings. While attention has been paid to the role of anticoagulants for VTE prevention in IBD patients, there are key barriers to prescribing anticoagulants in this population including: (1) absence of data on the effectiveness of anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE in IBD patients; (2) fear of bleeding complications; and (3) lack of evidence on the safety of anticoagulants in high-risk subgroups such as patients with active disease flares or postpartum IBD patients, who are at an increased risk of adverse complications. The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate the use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in IBD patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The applicant will achieve the proposed aims of this K99/R00 award under the guidance of established researchers who span the disciplines of epidemiology, biostatistics, gastroenterology, and hematology at the University of Pennsylvania. First, the applicant will use a combination of machine learning and advanced methodological techniques to examine predictors of use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in the inpatient setting (K99 phase). In the R00 phase, the applicant will use linked electronic health records/claims database to examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin, and heparins in IBD patients in the outpatient setting. The research proposed in this K99/R00 is critical since it provides timely needed information on the risks and benefits of anticoagulants in IBD patients, data that will not be forthcoming from large RCTs in the foreseeable future. The proposed career development and training goals will provide the applicant with training in predictive modeling, time-varying adjustment, and machine learning. The successful completion of the proposed training, infrastructure, and institutional support at the University of Pennsylvania will guarantee the applicant's success and transition to scientific independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of anticoagulants vastly under-represented patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] despite their increased risk of venous thromboembolism [VTE]. Using inpatient data, outpatient data, machine learning algorithms, and data linkage, the applicant will evaluate the risks and benefits of anticoagulants in IBD patients.","Anticoagulant use, safety, and effectiveness for venous thromboembolism prevention in inflammatory bowel disease patients",10282884,K99HL159230,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Goals ', ' Hematology ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Heparin ', ' Heparinic Acid ', ' Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin ', ' LMWH ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inpatients ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Warfarin ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' prophylactic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' skills ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Flare ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' alternative treatment ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' comparative safety ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2021,91943
"Leveraging the Microbiome, Local Admixture, and Machine Learning to Optimize Anticoagulant Pharmacogenomics in Medically Underserved Patients ABSTRACT  Warfarin remains one of the most commonly prescribed drugs and a leading cause of emergency hospitalizations. Warfarin use is especially common in medically underserved patients such as African Americans (AAs) and Latinos, which is particularly concerning since AAs and Latinos suffer worse outcomes due to suboptimal warfarin therapy. Thus AAs and Latinos can derive a distinct benefit from warfarin pharmacogenomic (PGx) algorithms, which maximize safety and efficacy by predicting individualized warfarin dose. However, currently available PGx algorithms have critical limitations, including a lack of generalizability to non-white populations and a failure to account for 50 percent of variability in warfarin dose. Under-representation in clinical studies, the propensity to cause adverse events, and a lack of consideration of admixed populations in clinical PGx guidelines are all factors that contribute to limited utility of warfarin PGx algorithms in diverse populations. Many potential sources of warfarin stable dose variability remain critically unexplored, including the role of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species, the influence of local ancestry at warfarin pharmacogenes, and the potential for machine learning techniques to enable accurate warfarin dosing algorithms in diverse populations. This proposal addresses the overarching hypothesis that warfarin stable dose prediction can be improved by incorporation of gut microbiome data, measures of local ancestry, and machine learning in diverse populations. We will pursue three Specific Aims (SAs) to test this hypothesis: (SA1) Determine the impact of abundance of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacteria from the gut microbiome on warfarin stable dose and; (SA2) Determine the influence of local admixture on warfarin stable dose in admixed populations; (SA3) Optimize warfarin PGx algorithms for diverse populations using machine learning. In SA#1, we will conduct a clinical study with fecal sample collection at anticoagulation clinic visits and perform whole genome bacterial sequencing to identify the effect of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species on warfarin stable dose. In SA#2, we will estimate African, European, and Native American local ancestry in warfarin pharmacogenes in a large, admixed population (n=1194) and determine its effects on warfarin stable dose. In SA#3, a large, diverse population of warfarin treated patients (n=7366) will be used to develop machine learning models and test improved prediction of warfarin stable dose over existing linear regression models. Our studies overcome major limitations of previous warfarin PGx studies by leveraging gut microbiome data, local ancestry, machine learning, and diverse, admixed populations. The outcomes of this work will provide a framework for local ancestry investigation with other PGx drug-gene pairs, enabling use of clinical PGx guidelines in admixed populations. This research has the potential to identify new sources of variability in warfarin dose, improve the safety and efficacy of warfarin treatment, and reduce disparities in PGx research for medically underserved patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This research project will help define new factors that contribute to variability in therapeutic warfarin dose requirements. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve genotype-guided warfarin dosing algorithms and reduce adverse drug events associated with warfarin therapy. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH mission that pertains to reducing the burden of adverse drug reactions in cardiovascular disease.","Leveraging the Microbiome, Local Admixture, and Machine Learning to Optimize Anticoagulant Pharmacogenomics in Medically Underserved Patients",10270784,R01HL158686,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diet Records ', ' Dietary Records ', ' Food Diaries ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Drug Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vitamin K ', ' Warfarin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Native Americans ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' CYP2C9 ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIC, Polypeptide 9 ', ' CYP2C9 gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' medically underserved ', ' medically under served ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing ', ' 16S gene sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA gene sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA genomic profiling ', ' 16S rRNA sequencing ', ' 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing ', ' 16S sequencing ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' bacterial genome sequencing ', ' bacterial whole genome sequencing ', ' gut bacteria ', ' bacteria in the gut ', ' bacterial community ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' support vector machine ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,419114
"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the Affordable Care Act-mandated Hospital Readmission Reduction Program launched in 2012 has modestly reduced readmissions, an unintended consequence has been the shift of a significant fraction of heart failure (HF)-related care to the outpatient setting.

"Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality Project Summary Climate change is the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. While numerous pathways of the health impact of climate change have been proposed, the “climate penalty” effect, i.e., a warming temperature worsens ambient air quality and consequently influences human health, remains poorly understood, resulting in an underestimated public health burden associated with global warming. Our previous epidemiological studies have reported that higher summer mean temperatures and higher PM2.5 concentrations are each associated with increased all-cause mortality in the Medicare population (aged ≥65) in the Southeastern US (SEUS)1, 2. Satellite and ground-based observations suggest a strong dependence of air pollution on interannual variabilities of summer mean temperature in SEUS3. These findings suggest that the indirect health effect of temperature via the climate penalty on air quality can be potentially important in the SEUS region, in addition to the direct adverse effects that we observed. However, clear epidemiological evidence of the air pollution serving as a mediator for the health effects of temperature, and accurate estimate of this effect is still missing in current literature. Herein, drawing on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that rising temperature can indirectly affect all-cause mortality via worsening both PM2.5 and ozone levels in the SEUS. We propose a study that will leverage the Medicare cohort from 2000-2016 (124 million person-years), the largest longitudinal cohort available for the SEUS and the high-resolution temperature, PM2.5, and O3 data, to investigate all-cause mortality in response to the “climate penalty” effect using a mediation statistical analysis. Specifically, in this project we will (1) update the present- day temperature and ozone predictions at 1-km2 grids across the SEUS through 2016 by incorporating ensemble averaging of machine learning models; (2) quantify the health effect of “climate penalty” on all-cause mortality using a mediation analysis, and explore whether mitigating anthropogenic air pollution emissions might serve as a pathway of climate change adaptation; (3) perform a risk assessment on the excess deaths related to the climate penalty on air pollution for the mid- (2050) and late-21st century (2100), using climate model output, chemical transport modeling, along with the top-down estimate of “climate penalty” from Aim 2. The proposed research will improve understanding of the interplays between climate, air pollution, and human health based on real-world big data, and provide epidemiological evidence of an important pathway that climate change adversely affects human health, with immediate relevance to climate and environmental policymaking. Project Narrative This project aims to estimate the health effect of “climate penalty”, i.e., the rising temperature indirectly affects human health via worsening ambient air quality (primarily PM2.5 and ozone levels) using a mediation analysis based on satellite-retrieved exposures and Medicare all-cause mortality. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the indirect health effect of a warming climate by worsening air quality can be a major public health burden of future climate change, and 2) improving air quality by reducing anthropogenic emission can mitigate the health effect of climate penalty. We will also forecast the excess deaths in 2050 and 2100 related to the climate penalty on air pollution using climate model ensembles simulated for different emission scenarios.",Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality,10218738,R21ES032606,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' NO2 ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' oxidation ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Suggestion ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Global Warming ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pollution ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Reaction ', ' air pollution control ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' anthropogenesis ', ' anthropogenic ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' warm temperature ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' atmospheric chemistry ', ' atmosphere chemistry ', ' tropospheric ozone ', ' ground-level ozone ', ' tropospheric O3 ', ' climate impact ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' ventilation ', ' ']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,260895
"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,10218265,R01HL146754,"['Adult ', '

"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost.

"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation.

"Machine learning approach to non-invasive MRI-based blood oximetry PROJECT SUMMARY Measurement of blood oxygen (O2) saturation, the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin in blood, provides information on whole-body and organ-specific O2 delivery and consumption and is used to guide therapy and intervention. Blood sampling and analysis by invasive catheterization performed under X-ray fluoroscopic guidance is the standard method used to measure O2 saturation in multiple anatomical locations in the cardiac chambers and major blood vessels. Non-invasive measurement of O2 saturation using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was first proposed nearly 30 years ago; however, previous techniques have relied on fitting the Luz- Meiboom model and other model variants using traditional linear and non-linear regression model approaches. Although the model captures the basic underlying biophysical principles, it does not fully characterize the complex relationship between blood O2 saturation and the MR signal. Despite being a non-invasive, non- radiating alternative to invasive catheterization, the low accuracy of MR oximetry, due to inadequacy of the model as well as estimation methods, have prevented the technique from gaining clinical acceptance. We propose to overcome this critical limitation by meeting our overall objective; to deploy a model-free approach based on machine learning (ML) to develop and implement an accurate, clinically feasible, MR oximetry technique. We hypothesize that ML algorithms provide greater flexibility in parameter estimation than traditional methods, and can be trained to learn and map the true in vivo relationship that describes the sensitivity of MR blood signal to O2 saturation. We intend to achieve our objective through the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a supervised ML algorithm for MR oximetry. Pre-training will occur with training data simulated using the L-M model and then augmented with in vivo data via transfer learning. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will design and implement a 3D MR oximetry method for volumetric data acquisition. A volumetric map will facilitate O2 saturation measurement throughout the vascular system, and will support the combination with 4D flow to evaluate O2 delivery and consumption. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed ML-based 3D MR oximetry technique in a small cohort of patients referred for catheter-based O2 saturation measurement. For the first time, our proposed work will apply machine learning to accurately characterize the in vivo sensitivity of the transverse relaxation time (T2) weighted MR blood signal to O2 saturation, using a unique combination of simulated and in vivo training data. ML-based MR oximetry will provide the accuracy of measurement required for clinical use, and therefore will be able to replace or reduce the frequency and duration of an invasive, radiation-based method with a safe, non-invasive alternative. ML-based MR oximetry as an imaging tool is expected to significantly improve the diagnostic value of an MR exam, and will be especially valuable in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. Our work thus aligns with the mission of NIBIB to have a positive impact on human health with the development of novel technology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work is relevant to public health because it will lead to a non-invasive, non-radiating biomedical technology to measure blood oxygen saturation at multiple locations within the heart and other blood vessels as an alternative to invasive catheterization. The project aligns with NIBIB’s goal to improve disease detection and management as this is the first application of machine learning to refine a novel 3D volumetric magnetic resonance technique to accurately determine oxygen saturation in the blood.

"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10231252,R21HD103039,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Couples ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eastern Europe ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ownership ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Tests ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Romania ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' postnatal ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' International ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tobacco control ', ' pilot trial ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' iterative design ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' public health intervention ', ' peer support ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' adaptive learning ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' smoking during pregnancy ', ' prenatal smoking ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' prepregnancy ', ' prenatal cigarette smoking ', ' pregnant cigarette smoker ', ' pregnant smoker ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' feasibility testing ', ' telephone coaching ', ' coaching calls ', ' telephone counseling ', ' ']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,170078
"Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise. There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES, the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise- specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real- world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage during exercise, and few validated tools exist to recommend treatment options to avoid dangerous complications resulting from low blood glucose. This proposal combines physiological modelling and deep learning to develop a novel artificial intelligence decision support system to help multiple daily injection users maintain safe blood glucose levels during and after exercise. We will build and validate this system in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes,10231944,F30DK128914,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Jogging ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Structure of beta Cell of islet ', ' Pancreatic beta Cell ', ' Pancreatic β-Cell ', ' pancreas beta cell ', ' pancreas β cell ', ' pancreatic b-cell ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Cutaneous ', ' diabetic ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' glucose uptake ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' physiologic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' resistance exercise ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Injections ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients ABSTRACT Pregnant people are a vulnerable population: healthcare professionals must exercise caution in prescribing many common pharmaceuticals to expectant patients, given potential risk of injury to a developing fetus. Arguably, teratogenicity is the most serious manifestation of fetal toxicity, as teratogens lead to fetal malformation and are implicated in physical and mental disabilities throughout the life course of an affected child. Consideration of teratogenicity, however, is a largely nonsystematic process. While regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration have established discrete teratogenicity scores for evaluating drug safety, these classification criteria provide little concrete distinction among score classes, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to systematically determine the teratogenic potential of a drug. This effect ripples to the bedside, as providers lack robust data on most drugs to inform their judgements of safety, efficacy, and risk in recommending therapies to expectant patients. Consequently, treatment of many diseases during pregnancy remains understudied and uncertain, for fear of causing harm. To address these shortcomings and improve quality of care for pregnant patients and their unborn children, we propose the development of a holistic, generalizable framework for the identification of teratogenic drug exposures via a new paradigm of clinical pharmacovigilance. Therefore, given our inability to evaluate drug safety in pregnant patients in real time, the objective of our investigation is to develop an observational platform to uncover new drug safety information through strategic, associative analysis of medication history within the electronic health record (EHR) of a pregnant patient and developmental diseases within the EHRs of their neonates. This approach will harness 48,434 linked maternal and neonatal EHRs within the Research Derivative, a databank of identified EHRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, across which we plan to apply and appropriately validate a medication-wide association study to uncover new, data-driven associations between maternal medication exposures and teratogenic health outcomes. To date, we have employed this technique to discover 129 associations between maternal drug exposure and neurodevelopmental diseases from existing primary care data, which recapitulate teratogens well-known to clinical practice that also serve as positive controls for our model. Now, we hope to expand our platform to encompass more advanced techniques of clinical trial emulation; if successful, we anticipate that discovering new toxicants through retrospective data modeling will greatly enhance our goal of systematically clarifying cases of suspect drug safety in pregnancy. In the long run, we hope this approach will allow clinicians to embrace a more accurate knowledge base in their evaluation of the risks and benefits in prescribing drugs with unclear teratogenic risks to their pregnant patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE From the perspective of regulatory agencies for public health and safety, it is unethical to perform clinical trials on pregnant people to assess drug safety and efficacy for the treatment of diseases of pregnancy; paradoxically, while this policy recognizes the vulnerability of an expectant mother and her unborn child, it has created a public health emergency for millions of pregnant patients, as clinicians lack robust data on treatments for these conditions and still do not know whether many common drugs are safe to prescribe to their pregnant patients. To address these problems, this project aims to harness the burgeoning science of machine learning to create a surrogate for randomized, controlled drug trials in pregnant populations, via the development of a “target trial” platform to discover new drug safety and efficacy insights from medication and disease data in linked maternal and neonatal electronic health records that were originally collected during routine medical care. Upon completion of this project, pharmaceutical scientists may employ the resulting target trial framework to clarify drug safety concerns for pregnant patients, and clinicians may benefit more definitive data in their choice of safe and effective medications for expectant mothers.",Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients,10232840,R21HD105304,"['Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant Care ', ' baby care ', ' infant health care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' newborn care ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity -

"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiopulmonary Bypass ', ' Heart-Lung Bypass ', ' heart bypass ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' natural hypothermia ', ' Hypothermia ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity -

"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,10231227,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Organ Failure ', ' MOF syndrome ', ' Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ', ' multiorgan failure ', ' multiple organ system failure ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Ventricular Function ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Refractory Disease ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Data Science ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' rural setting ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' Infrastructure ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' computable phenotypes ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,817390
"Deep Learning Approaches to Risk Stratification in Acute Gastrointestinal Bleeding PROJECT SUMMARY  Acute gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for over 2.2 million hospital days and 19.2 billion dollars of medical charges annually. 52% to 55% of patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding are unnecessarily hospitalized, leading to wasted resources. Although risk stratification of patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding is recommended, risk-assessment scoring systems are not commonly used in practice, have sub- optimal performance, may be applied incorrectly, and are not easily updated.  Most current risk scores were designed for use based on the location of the bleeding source: upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. However, the location of the bleeding source is not always clear at presentation. A risk score that bases initial assessment on presenting symptoms (e.g., hematemesis, melena, hematochezia) is more relevant and useful in clinical practice. The electronic health record can be used to identify patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms and extract clinical data to automatically calculate risk scores that are made available to providers. Machine learning (field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed), particularly deep learning using neural networks (collection of nodes that process and transmit information), can create electronic health record-based models that perform better than clinical risk scores for gastrointestinal bleeding and are well-suited for learning from new data.  This proposal will use deep learning tools on electronic health record data to decrease unnecessary hospitalization in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding by identifying low risk patients. The goals are to 1) Develop and validate an accurate and clinically useful deep learning algorithm for initial risk stratification superior to existing clinical risk scores 2) Develop and validate a dynamic deep learning tool to model risk over time, and 3) Pilot the best performing algorithms in the electronic health record. Deep learning algorithms will be developed using a dataset of electronic health record data of 7,000 patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding from two academic hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System. Validation will be performed on a separate dataset of patients at Partners Healthcare in Boston, Massachusetts. Neural network approaches will be applied to patients’ data updated over time to evaluate the trajectory towards requiring transfusion of red blood cells. Finally, a pilot study will implement the best-performing algorithms in the electronic health record for a 3-month period to test feasibility of deployment and acceptability to providers and patients. Planned coursework includes deep learning with biomedical data, risk assessment and longitudinal analysis.  This work has potential to generate cost savings through better integrated risk stratification of patients presenting with overt gastrointestinal bleeding. To meet the research and educational goals of this proposal, the mentorship team includes a primary mentor in gastrointestinal bleeding and co-mentors in deep learning, electronic health record-based clinical trial design of prognostic algorithms, and implementation science. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIH Artificial Intelligence Working Group recently challenged the medical community to train researchers in both healthcare and computer science, proposing that dual training is fundamental to advance artificial intelligence into healthcare and assure these models are safe, interpretable, and effectively integrated into real- world systems. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause of hospitalization for gastrointestinal diseases and many patients are unnecessarily hospitalized. A symptom-based risk assessment tool is more clinically useful than existing scores; this can be developed with deep learning approaches and deployed on the electronic health record to decrease unnecessary and costly hospitalizations.",Deep Learning Approaches to Risk Stratification in Acute Gastrointestinal Bleeding,10215914,K23DK125718,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Boston ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Goals ', ' Hematochezia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Melena ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Erythrocyte Transfusion ', ' Red Blood Cell Transfusion ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Transfusion ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Lower Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' Lower GI Tract ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' gastrointestinal symptom ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' implementation science ', ' tool development ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' clinical risk ', ' Patient Triage ', ' Patient risk ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' acute symptom ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193538
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Defecation ', ' bowel movement ', ' Diuretics ', ' Engineering ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Potassium ', ' K element ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Urination ', ' micturition ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' patient monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Collection ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' patient population ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health data ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical decision support ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' classification algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' remote monitoring ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,210277
"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications.

"Developing a clinical decision support tool for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of critical illness in hospitalized patients PROJECT SUMMARY Up to 5% of hospitalized adult patients on the medical-surgical wards develop clinical deterioration requiring intensive care. Medical errors are common before deterioration events, including delays and misjudgments in identification, diagnosis, and treatment, and these errors lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is critically important to improve the care of high-risk ward patients to decrease preventable in-hospital deaths.  The current paradigm for attempting to decrease mortality from deterioration has several limitations. First, most early warning scores designed to identify high-risk patients are based only on vital signs and have limited accuracy. Clinical notes are an underutilized, rich source of information comprising nearly 80% of electronic health record (EHR) data. Natural language processing (NLP) can extract important risk factors from clinical notes for machine learning models to improve accuracy over existing tools. Second, current early warning scores only tell clinicians that a patient is at high risk but provide no information regarding what clinical condition is causing a patient’s deterioration. This leads to diagnostic and treatment errors, which results in worse patient outcomes. Developing tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy for high-risk ward patients could lead to fewer medical errors, decreased costs, and improved outcomes. Third, the initial treatment decisions for deteriorating patients are made by clinicians with limited experience caring for critically ill patients, which can result in delays of potentially life-saving therapies. By utilizing a large, granular, multicenter dataset, algorithms to predict the treatments a patient should receive can be developed, resulting in early, targeted, potentially life-saving therapy.  The long-term goal is to develop and implement clinically useful decision support tools to decrease preventable death from deterioration. The overall objective of this project is to develop a clinical decision support tool for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of patients at high risk of deterioration. This objective will be pursued in the following three specific aims: 1) Develop machine learning models to identify patients at high risk of deterioration using both structured data and unstructured clinical notes; 2) Develop models to predict the diagnosis that is causing the deterioration event and the potentially life-saving treatments that should be provided to high-risk patients; 3) Develop a clinical decision support tool with a graphical user interface incorporating the models from Aims 1 and 2 via user-centered design principles and then test its effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction in a case-based simulation study. This research is innovative because it will utilize NLP, reinforcement learning, interpretable machine learning, and multi-task transfer learning approaches. The proposed research is significant because it will provide clinicians with powerful new tools that can be implemented in the EHR to identify, diagnose, and make treatment recommendations for high-risk patients. This will result in the delivery of early, personalized care to decrease preventable death from deterioration. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on developing a clinical decision support tool for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of hospitalized patients at high risk of clinical deterioration. This work will result in novel algorithms that can be implemented to deliver early, personalized care to decrease preventable morbidity and mortality from deterioration. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.","Developing a clinical decision support tool for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of critical illness in hospitalized patients",10182492,R01HL157262,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' satisfaction ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' ward ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' case-based ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' high risk ', ' common treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' cost outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' structured data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,574395

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Weather ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' care costs ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prealbumin ', ' Proalbumin ', ' Transthyretin ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technetium ', ' Tc element ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Mediating ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Tc 99m ', ' Technetium 99m ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Afro-Caribbean ', ' black Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Adopted ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Nuclear ', ' Penetrance ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Recontacts ', ' Address ', ' Amyloid Fibrils ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' population health ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' underserved minority ', ' under served minority ', ' racial minority ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antihistamines ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Incidence ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Torsades de Pointes ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Translating ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' Measures ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' delayed rectifier potassium channel ', ' delayed rectifying potassium channel ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' drug market ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' heart cell ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' complex data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device Safety ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Device Designs ', ' Device Safety ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' systems research ', ' post-market ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' surveillance study ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Injections ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,10206237,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Data Collection ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' national surveillance ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' risk minimization ', ' surveillance data ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' comparative treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,486155
"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Family ', ' Forehead ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Running ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Sleep ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Auras ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Subclinical Seizures ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Modeling ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' encryption ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Secure ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' Bluetooth ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' digital health ', ' remote monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,934442
"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring

"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,10114147,R01HL141892,"['Affect ', ' Albumins ', ' Restrictive Cardiomyopathy ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' lung transplant ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Perfusion ', ' Prostitution ', ' commercial sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' survival sex ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Liver Failure ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' forest ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Caring ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Hypoalbuminemia ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' time use ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transplant registry ', ' transplant database ', ' transplant data base ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' cardiac cachexia ', ' improved outcome ', ' transplant centers ', ' cardiac device ', ' cardiodevice ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' survival disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,526607
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' side effect ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Meningoencephalitis ', ' Cerebromeningitis ', ' Encephalomeningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prospective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical practice ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' computational intelligence ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231
"Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders Opioid addiction is a major crisis of epidemic proportions and drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that has been shown in recent studies to be equivalent in efficacy to buprenorphine. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Project Narrative Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders,10376890,UG3DA048502,"['Brain ', ' Brain

"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antirheumatic Agents ', ' Anti-Rheumatic Agents ', ' Anti-Rheumatic Drugs ', ' Antirheumatic Drugs ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insurance ', ' arthropathies ', ' Joint Diseases ', ' arthropathic ', ' arthropathy ', ' joint disorder ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mission ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Drug Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs ', ' DMARD ', ' DMARDs ', ' Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Cachectin ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' TNF ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNFA ', ' TNFα ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' TNF gene ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' spondyloarthropathy ', ' Spondylarthropathies ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' NIAMS ', ' cost ', ' epidemiological model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' electronic structure ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' clinical predictors ', ' genetic predictors ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' patient screening ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' joint inflammation ', ' inflamed joint ', ' joint swelling ', ' infection risk ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"A clinical prediction rule for identifying South African colorectal cancer patients who will fail to engage in oncology care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health problem in South Africa (SA). Preliminary research from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), SA shows that 23% of newly diagnosed CRC patients in the public healthcare sector will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC). This complicates oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this setting. There are a variety of resource-intensive interventions for addressing FEOC. However, implementing these in all newly diagnosed CRC patients would be unfeasible, given the high patient volumes and existing resource constraints in the SA public healthcare sector. A clinical prediction rule (CPR) is proposed for identifying newly diagnosed SA CRC patients who are at high risk of FEOC, thereby enabling more efficient targeting of these specific, high risk patients for interventions which seek to address FEOC. The CPR will be developed by: 1) Identifying potential predictors of FEOC in CRC populations through a systematic review of the literature and a survey of 109 patients; 2) Constructing an appropriate electronic data collection tool that will streamline prospective data collection for these potential predictors and the study outcome, FEOC, from a cohort of 398 newly diagnosed CRC patients; and 3) Applying machine learning methods to the data to derive and internally validate the CPR. The CPR will be an important first step in tackling the high FEOC rates amongst newly diagnosed CRC patients in KZN, SA and will ultimately contribute toward improving both CRC disease management and patient outcomes in this setting. The proposed K43 research has the potential to be scaled up to the national level, and this will be the basis of a future R01 grant application. Dr. Moodley (K43 applicant) wants to become an independent gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs, particularly CPRs that seek to address breakdowns in linkage to care and reduce the burden of disease attributed to gastrointestinal cancers, such as CRC. This award will provide him with protected time to conduct the proposed research and engage in an intensive career development program while based at one of the top universities in SA, the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He will be mentored by esteemed senior researchers from SA (Prof. Thandinkosi Madiba, University of KwaZulu-Natal) and the US (Prof. Ravi Pokala Kiran, Columbia University) who have a strong track record of mentoring young researchers. A research advisory committee, comprised of other senior researchers, will provide additional research and career guidance to Dr. Moodley. This will be coupled with didactic and “hands on” training in the core competencies required to develop CPRs. It is envisioned that by the end of his K43 training, Dr. Moodley will have developed the proposed CPR and generated new preliminary data. He will use this new data to successfully apply for an R01 grant, thus establishing his independence as gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE An unacceptably high proportion of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa (SA) will fail to engage in oncology care (FEOC), thereby complicating oncologists’ and oncologic surgeons’ efforts to effectively manage CRC disease in this resource-limited setting. A novel clinical prediction rule (CPR) will be developed that will allow for specific CRC patients who are at higher risk of FEOC to be identified and efficiently targeted for resource-intensive strategies which seek to reduce FEOC rates.

"Cardiovascular MRI Characterization of the Arrhythmogenic Heart in Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) is responsible for 50% of deaths in patients with structural heart disease. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established therapy for reducing arrhythmic mortality. Current guidelines for use of primary prevention ICD (i.e., patients without VT/VF history, but at risk) mainly emphasize left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, only a small percentage of ICD recipients actually receive appropriate ICD shocks, resulting in unnecessary costs and morbidity. While there is strong evidence that ICDs reduce mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, the benefit of primary prevention ICDs in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) is less robust. Furthermore, SCD mostly occurs in patients with moderate systolic dysfunction who are currently not eligible for an ICD, further highlighting the limitations of LVEF to choose appropriate ICD candidates. Given the limitations of LVEF, there is a pressing need for better risk stratification strategies to identify which NICM patients are most likely to benefit from ICD therapy. Our three specific aims seek to 1) identify the biological basis of cardiac MR (CMR) radiomic phenotyping of the myocardium by investigating the association between endocardial/epicardial electrograms (EGM) and CMR radiomic markers; 2) investigate CMR imaging markers that can identify patients with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction (LVEF of 36% to 50%) at risk of ventricular arrhythmia, who are likely to benefit from prophylactic ICD therapy and ultimately reduce total SCD burden; and 3) identify NICM patients with LVEF 35% undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who are less likely to benefit from ICD by developing a novel risk prediction model integrating CMR markers. Precise identification of individuals who are at risk of SCD will (a) reduce mortality by offering ICD therapy to patients with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction who are currently not eligible, and (b) reduce morbidity and healthcare costs in ICD-eligible patients who are at low risk of SCD and unlikely to obtain a worthwhile benefit. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is responsible for 50% of deaths in patients with structural heart disease. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an established therapy for reducing arrhythmic mortality.

"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10188632,R01HL154744,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Ischemia ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Fostering ', ' Impaired Renal Function ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' magnetic field ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modeling ', ' patient safety ', ' Heart Muscle tissue ', ' Myocardial tissue ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' individual patient ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' radiomics ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,864762
"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity.

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools PROJECT SUMMARY  Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,10117719,R01NS094399,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Single Seizures ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' technology/technique ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' clinical care ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,512781
"Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports Abstract Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP, medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. Project Narrative Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy to the patient in the short or medium term, but also may lead to overtreatment, which comes with substantial downstream expenditures as well as patient anxiety. In this project, we will build natural language processing approaches to extract cancer related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and create the first large scale incidentaloma database for half-a-million patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center between 2007 and 2019 (Aim 2).

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10192507,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Calibration ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lithotripsy ', ' Litholapaxy ', ' Methodology ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Ramp ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', "" Bowman's space "", ' Urinary Space ', ' Painless ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' re-treatment ', ' Retreatment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' patient safety ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Detection ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' P01 Program ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Renal Tissue ', ' in vivo ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' safety study ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Wait Time ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' complex data ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2021,1563076
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder.

However, these methods require an expert-operator and are expensive, and aortic aneurysms are considerably underdetected at present and may become even more underdetected in the future as the disease prevalence increases with societal aging. The broad goal is to establish a point-of-care device that is convenient in use and cost (e.g., in a smartphone form factor) for aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. The underlying hypothesis is that arterial waveforms, which can be obtained with such a device, constitute a non- imaging solution for indicating aneurysm size. This new hypothesis will be efficiently and effectively tested by leveraging a wealth of existing patient data. These data include high-fidelity, non-invasive waveforms from four arterial sites and reference imaging measurements of aneurysm size from at least 217 patients and 217 matchable controls. The specific aims are to develop and validate (1) physics-based methods and (2) machine learning methods for predicting aneurysm size from arterial waveforms. The physics-based methods will fit tube-load models of arterial wave transmission and reflection to the waveforms to estimate parameters indicative of aneurysm size. The machine learning methods will employ linear regression or a neural network and take inputs comprising waveform features such as pulse wave velocity, which decreases with increasing aneurysm diameter as predicted by the well-known Moens-Korteweg equation, and number of local waveform maxima, which may increase with enhanced negative wave reflection induced by aneurysm growth, as well as confounding factors such as blood pressure and age, which also alter pulse wave velocity, to predict aneurysm diameter. These methods will be optimized using a portion of the patient data for application to various combinations of the arterial waveforms (e.g., proximal and distal waveforms or single waveforms). The developed methods will then be tested using the remaining data, while blinded to the reference aneurysm measurements, in terms of their ability to track aneurysm diameter and classify patients versus controls and patients before versus after endovascular repair. The final method will be chosen as the one that best balances accuracy of aneurysm monitoring with convenience of arterial waveform measurements. Successful completion of this project will guide the design and justify the development of a point-of-care device that may ultimately help mitigate aortic aneurysm mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE An aortic aneurysm – a balloon-like bulge in the body’s main blood vessel – is at risk for rupture, which often leads to death. However, taking a picture of inside the body to make a diagnosis requires an expert-operator and is expensive, and the condition is often left undetected. Research will be performed towards technology that is convenient in use and cost for monitoring aortic aneurysms.","Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms",10125246,R21EB029376,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Aortic Aneurysm ', ' aorta aneurysm ', ' Ballistocardiography ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Palpation ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Veterans ', ' Blinded ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Measurement ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Elderly man ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Rupture ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' prospective test ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,410344
"Personalized Risk Predictions with Deep Learning Methods in the Presence of Missing and Biased Electronic Health Record Data Abstract Since 2010, clinical medicine has benefited from a rapid surge of clinical research on chronic diseases using data from electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are appealing because they can offer large sample sizes, timely information, and a wealth of clinical information beyond that obtained from either health surveys or administrative data. However, while millions of patient records are included in large EHR records, they are not population-representative random samples, a constraint that potentially biases inferences based on such data and, therefore, has limited their utility for population health research. EHR data typically contain multiple types of biases, particularly: 1) sampling inclusion bias: EHR data only include information on patients visiting participating medical systems, and they primarily capture data when patients are ill. Even among populations with a particular disease, patients represented in EHRs tend to over-represent individuals who are sicker and have higher health care utilization; 2) sampling frequency bias: the numbers of patients’ encounters and features in EHRs are at various frequencies and these frequencies correlate with both patients’ characteristics and outcomes; and 3) institution bias: EHR samples of any hospital reflect the characteristics of patients population served by that specific hospital. Consequently, EHR-based risk prediction models will have 1) biases in risk factor selection and estimation for population inferences; 2) disparate mistreatment (unfairness) in terms of variation in a model’s prediction accuracy across patient subgroups (such as gender, race, and age) with various sampling inclusion probabilities or frequencies; 3) biased prediction model to reflect characteristics of patients served by the local hospitals. We propose to develop: 1) effective sample-weighting method to correct biases in risk factor selection and estimation for population inferences (Aim 1), 2) flexible deep learning method for EHR personalized risk prediction with fairness criteria (Aim 2); and 3) innovative calibration method to improve reproducibility of EHR-based risk models between institutions (Aim 3). We will predict risk of subsequent incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as a demonstration of methodology development. Broader use of these methods will be generally applicable to other diseases outcomes and population of interest. To develop and validate these methods, we propose to analyze three unique datasets: 1) the New York University Langone Health EHR data (NYU-CDRN, 2009 to now) including demographics, vitals, diagnoses, lab results, prescriptions, and procedures; 2) the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN)—an EHR network comprising 20 NYC healthcare institutions, including the NYU-CDRN, with longitudinally linked data on >12 million patient encounters under a Common Data Model, and 3) the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS, begun in 1992 and ongoing), as a benchmark population- based cohort, that has nationally representative health interview data for over 20 years, as well as biomarkers, physical assessment information, prescription drug data, and claims linkages. Project Narrative In this proposal, our interdisciplinary team proposes to develop and validate innovative methods to advance personalized risk prediction models in the presence of missing and biased EHR data We propose to develop: 1) effective sample-weighting method to correct biases in risk factor selection and estimation for population inferences (Aim 1), 2) flexible deep learning method for EHR personalized risk prediction with fairness criteria (Aim 2); and 3) innovative calibration method to improve reproducibility of EHR-based risk models between institutions (Aim 3).

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,10116356,R21DA050761,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physical Education ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Misinformation ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' satisfaction ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' treatment program ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' treatment center ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' urgent care ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' data resource ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' treatment services ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,202917
"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible. The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches. The use of this examination to predict difficult intubation is considered the of care in modern anesthesiology practice.

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10421230,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,138041
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy inducedneuropathy,10364532,R01CA249127,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Numbness ', ' Loss of Sensation ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Platinum ', ' Platinum Black ', ' Pt element ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Vinca Alkaloids ', ' Vinca Alkaloid Compound ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' taxane ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' analog ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' experience ', ' math ability ', ' math achievement ', ' math competence ', ' math competency ', ' math proficiency ', ' mathematic ability ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' number sense ', ' numeracy ', ' proficient in math ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Provider ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Motor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' chemotherapy induced neuropathy ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' chemotherapy ', ' high risk ', ' community based practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ', ' treatment choice ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' side effect ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,689634
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interoperability ', ' encryption ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' data access ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963
"Wake Forest Atrium HeartShare Clinical Center Project Summary Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF in the US and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, its pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and most trials have been neutral such that few evidence-based treatments exist. In response, NIH convened 2 workshops co-led by Dr. Kitzman (PI). The highest priority research recommendation was a coordinated effort to create a large cohort of HFpEF patients and controls and perform comprehensive, deep phenotyping. This became the basis for HeartShare, whose ultimate goals are to discover novel HFpEF mechanisms, subtypes, and therapeutic targets. Our Wake Forest - Atrium HFpEF team is highly qualified to serve as a Clinical Center and make robust, over-arching contributions to HeartShare. Dr. Kitzman is internationally recognized as a thought-leader in HFpEF with a sustained track record of developing novel concepts regarding HFpEF pathogenesis, mechanisms, and outcomes and designing and conducting innovative studies to test them. His team has extensive experience in all key aspects of the HeartShare program, particularly in recruiting, retaining, and phenotyping diverse populations of HFpEF patients and controls, often significantly exceeding goals for racial and gender diversity. Our institutions have ~15,000 HFpEF clinical visits annually. In all, our team has led or helped lead recruitment and phenotyping for 69 studies, mostly NIH-sponsored, with 15,354 participants, demonstrating our ability to fulfill HeartShare recruitment and phenotyping goals. Data from these studies will be contributed to the Cohort phase of HeartShare. We will make robust contributions to HeartShare by achieving 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Provide ‘thought leadership’ in collaboration with the HeartShare Steering Committee; Aim 2) Contribute data, images, and stored specimens cohort phase of HeartShare from our numerous studies of HFpEF and controls, and identify and phenotype HFpEF patients and controls from the electronic health record using robust bioinformatics tools; Aim 3) Recruit, consent, enroll and follow at least 250 HFpEF patients plus controls (type and number to be determined by consensus); Aim 4) Conduct state-of- the-art deep phenotyping exams using a collaboratively determined protocol. Our phenotyping proposal is highly innovative, with advanced echo-Doppler and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, CPET, physical activity monitoring, remote and artificial intelligence electrocardiography, sampling of skeletal muscle, adipose, blood, and microbiome, and mitochondrial energetics, and brain structure/function. Our diverse, cross- disciplinary team has the full range of complementary expertise and access to the robust resources of two large, closely affiliated health systems to ensure fulfillment of all HeartShare’s goals. We will help accelerate and optimize the program’s success with our insight, creativity, and sustained track record of collaboration, innovation, and dissemination. Project Narrative Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common, its mechanisms are not well understood, and there are few proven treatments; this problem will be addressed by HeartShare.

"Mobile oral cancer screening system for low-resource settings Two-thirds of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the 5-year survival rate is only 10-40. Enough is already known about the disease and its prevention for action to be taken. The poor survival rate in LMICs is mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative to detect precursor and malignant lesions early and expeditiously. To meet the need for technologies that enable oral cancer screening and diagnosis in low resource settings (LRS), Light Research Inc (LRI) will develop, validate, and commercialize a low-cost smartphone-based imaging system that provides remote specialist access and triage decision-making guidance tailored to non-specialist use in LRS. To achieve the project goal, LRI will license technologies from University of Arizona (UA), and partner with UA and Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center (MSCC) (Bangalore, India) to develop and validate a multimodal mobile oral imaging system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis in LRS. In the past few years, the project team has developed and evaluated a dual-mode (polarized white light imaging [pWLI]) and autofluorescence imaging [AFI])) mobile imaging device that specifically addresses critical barriers in LRS to improve oral cancer screening. To address one of the key hurdles in adopting optical imaging techniques for oral cancer screening in LRS, the team has also developed and evaluated cloud-based and mobile-based deep learning image classification methods for guiding patient triage. Since the key techniques proposed in this mobile imaging system have been successfully evaluated for oral cancer screening with 3,000 high-risk population in LRS, the potential of successfully transitioning it to the low- resource regions for accurate, objective and location-resolved detection of oral cancer is very high. The project objective will be achieved through three Aims: (1) to optimize a mobile intraoral imaging system for LRS, (2) to optimize deep learning-based dual-modality image classification methods, and (3) to validate the clinical usefulness of the mobile oral imaging system for oral cancer screening and triage in LSR. Successful completion of this project will lead to a mobile oral imaging system with deep learning image classification method that delivers urgently-needed capabilities to the end users in LRS. LRI will partner with Jana Care Inc (New Delhi, India) for low-cost production, with Ergo Healthcare (Mumbai, India) for product distribution in south and southeast Asian, and with DentalEZ Group for product distribution in America and Europe. The use of this mobile-based screening approach for early detection and triage of oral cancers will eventually improve oral cancer detection rates, treatment outcomes, and quality of life of patients in LRS. Project Narrative Light Research Inc (LRI) will develop and commercialize a mobile oral imaging system to address the urgent need of a low-cost, portable, easy to use, and reliable imaging device and deep learning image classification method for oral cancer screening in low resource settings (LRS).

"Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this proposal is to design and validate a Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) device which can non-invasively measure periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss based on cementoenamel junction (CEJ) location, gingival biotype and inflammation. Current periodontal evaluation methods are inaccurate because they are based on visual inspection and periodontal probing. While radiography offers detailed information about hard tissues such as bone and teeth, more detailed information about soft tissue is usually missed in radiography. Ultrasound/photoacoustic approach has been used in soft tissue imaging but rarely in dentistry because they have a large size transducer which limits the entire oral cavity scan. This is a fundamental limitation of existing technology. To solve this problem, StyloSonic LLC will construct and validate a miniaturized handpiece with a compact laser diode for ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging to provide key periodontal metrics. PUPI offers real-time, accurate, and repeatable measurements with utility in diagnosis and therapy monitoring. That is the value of this proposal. The workflow will include two parts: Aim 1 will design and fabricate the PUPI prototype and Aim 2 will evaluate the fundamental functionality of the device and confirm the validation in a pilot clinical study in collaboration with Dr. Casey Chen at University of Southern California. 100 teeth (5-10 patients) with moderate periodontitis (pocket depth: 4-6 mm) will be evaluated with PUPI and manual probing method before and 4-week after the nonsurgical treatment (i.e., scaling and root planning). That will give us 80% statistical power assuming an alpha of 0.05 based on our preliminary data. Our goal is to build a handpiece that can easily scan the entire oral cavity. We will test the designed miniaturized handpiece using an oral care manikin. We hypothesize that the correlation coefficient between probing and PUPI is R2 > 0.8. We also hypothesize that the PUPI will show a significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival biotype and inflammation before and four weeks after treatment (p <0.05). This approach is innovative because for the first time, the miniaturized handpiece of PUPI will provide anatomical and functional information of the entire gingiva architecture. In addition, PUPI will enable accurate diagnostics and therapy monitoring which add enormous value for recommended treatment and ensure best outcomes. The clinical impact is the proposed device will assist dentists and periodontists to accurately diagnose gingivitis in the early stage and reduce the rate of advanced periodontitis. This work will introduce a non-invasive and non- ionizing dual modality imaging technique which has significant impacts on oral health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dental health is critical to quality of life, but the tools that dentists use for periodontal exams are largely anatomical and inspect the gingiva by eye or periodontal charting.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load.

"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications. The system also paves the avenue for investigations of therapeutic potential for cardiac disease.",Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac

"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10263307,K01AG068361,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Influentials ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Workers ', ' Stress ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Logistics ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Familiarity ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' electronic structure ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' health data ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' predictive tools ', ' readmission risk ', ' re-admission risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' unstructured data ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,130140
"Digital Biomarkers of Ulcerative Colitis Flare This project will evaluate longitudinally collected physiological metrics, with a focus on autonomic nervous system function (heart rate variability [HRV]), using wearable devices. It will investigate the ability of these physiological metrics to identify and predict symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC) flares. It will explore the modifiability of these metrics through a HRV directed biofeedback intervention and its impact on UC symptoms. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support the development of Dr. Robert Hirten into an independent patient-oriented researcher in the field of digital health and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research. Dr. Hirten’s career goal is to be an independent researcher and leader in leveraging the dense physiological data acquired through novel wearable technologies in IBD research. Dr. Hirten’s proposed training activities are in five areas: (1) Advanced statistical methodology, (2) Digital health, (3) Clinical trial design, (4) Behavioral intervention science, (5) Career development. To achieve these goals Dr. Hirten has assembled a mentorship team led by Dr. Bruce Sands, Chief of Gastroenterology at The Mount Sinai Hospital who has expertise in longitudinal and clinical trial research in IBD. Environment: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has a strong tradition of research and is a top 20 medical school in NIH funding. The Mount Sinai Division of Gastroenterology is a top 10 division in the country by US News and World Report and is a leader in IBD research and clinical care. The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai is an international institute with expertise in data science, biomedical and digital engineering. Research: UC is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colon with symptomatic flares characterized by diarrhea, blood per rectum and abdominal pain. Flares are frequent, occurring in at least 30% of patients per year, and are associated with morbidity and impaired quality of life. Current methods to identify and predict flare are suboptimal and limited. If flares can be identified earlier and predicted strategies for mitigation or prevent could be instituted. Advances in digital and wearable technology allow for collection of continuous, non-invasive physiological parameters potentially linked with disease activity. Therefore, our specific aims are to (1) To determine the association of physiological metrics, including HRV, with symptomatic flare in UC, (2) To assess the predictive ability of physiological metrics, with a focus on HRV, for the development of symptomatic flare in UC, (3) Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and effect size of a HRV biofeedback intervention in subjects with symptomatic UC. To accomplish this we will perform a longitudinal cohort study enrolling 160 subjects with UC in remission and follow them for 12 months or until flare, collecting physiological indices from a wearable device (Apple Watch) and survey metrics from a smart phone application. In addition, we will perform a HRV directed biofeedback intervention in 23 subjects with UC and symptomatic flare. The general approach and skills acquired during this award can be applied to future R01 grants aimed at building upon the findings from this work. There are not effective strategies to identify or predict flares of ulcerative colitis (UC), which are common and result in morbidity. We aim to identify and modify readily obtainable physiological metrics, focusing on autonomic nervous system function, to recognize flares early, predict their development and improve symptomatology.

"The Long-Run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden Among US Elderly and Disabled Adults OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Long-run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden among US Elderly and Disabled Adults Natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity in recent decades, a trend projected to intensify under climate change. The risks these disasters pose to individual health and well-being are heightened among older adults with age-related disabilities or chronic illness, such as those living with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Public policies regarding disaster preparedness and response serve an important role in avoiding or reducing the health impacts of disasters and improving individual health resiliency. The optimal design of these policies depends crucially on quantifying the short- and long-run health risks imposed by disasters, precisely identifying the most vulnerable populations, and understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive and mediate outcomes. However, much remains unknown about these important dimensions. This project will use individual-level administrative Medicare data on all elderly (65+) and long-term disabled beneficiaries from 1992– 2017 to estimate the short- and long-run effects of a broad range of natural disasters – such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods – on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly. The study will compile a comprehensive and spatially detailed database of US natural disasters from a variety of data sources. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit ZIP code of residence, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of victims more precisely than prior research. The project will track individuals living in disaster-affected areas before the disaster regardless of where they move, and a control group of unaffected elderly will be used to establish how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of the event. The project will also use a new machine learning approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations based on individual health characteristics (e.g., pre-existing chronic conditions), demographic traits (e.g., age, race, sex), and local economic and public health circumstances (e.g., per capita income, prevalence of obesity, community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System). The project will also assess several continuity-of-care mechanisms that could moderate or exacerbate post-disaster mortality and disease impacts, including damage to health care facilities, loss of access to one’s physician, and health plan network restrictions. This analysis will be performed for the whole population of beneficiaries and for subpopulations thought to be particularly vulnerable to continuity-of-care disruptions, like adults with multiple pre-existing chronic conditions. Finally, the project will estimate the extent to which certain characteristics (e.g., health care availability, local government expenditure, and healthy behaviors) in areas where victims relocate to following a disaster can explain their health outcomes.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients.

"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['Animals ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Cannabidiol ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Isoflurophate ', ' Di-isopropylphosphorofluoridate ', ' Diisopropylfluorophosphate ', ' Diisopropylphosphofluoridate ', ' Fluostigmine ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Status Epilepticus ', ' Generalized Status Epilepticus ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' valproate ', ' 2 propylvalerate ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' Intoxication ', ' Modeling ', ' nerve agent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurologic Effect ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' parent grant ', ' screening ', ' Drug Screening ', ' medical countermeasure ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' acquired epilepsy ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798
"Operationalizing Machine Learning and Discrete Event Simulation Models to Improve Clinic Efficiency PROJECT SUMMARY Physicians often report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Systematic data-driven methods for efficiently scheduling patients are important as physicians are pressured to see more and more patients. We propose that real time prediction models of patient visit lengths, the likelihood of missing appointments, and of patient wait times will help schedule patients more efficiently. Clinics will be able to safely overbook to avoid empty slots from missed appointments, have guidance for scheduling urgent add-on patients, and provide wait time estimates for patients when there are delays. We will develop methodologies for accessing data needed for these predictions in real time and propose that the integration of these models into workflows will improve scheduling accuracy, patient wait time, and patient satisfaction, while also increasing clinic volumes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physicians report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Machine learning and discrete event simulation model predictions can help schedule patients more efficiently, but need to be integrated into the EHR and scheduling workflows to be effective.

"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics.

"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Sweden ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' QRS Complex ', ' EKG QRS Complex ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Width ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785
"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,10229408,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Intestinal Diseases ', ' Intestinal Disorder ', ' intestine disease ', ' intestine disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver ', ' Primary liver cancer ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nodule ', ' Pancreatic Diseases ', ' Pancreatic Disorder ', ' pancreas disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs

"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Bundle-Branch Block ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Mosses ', ' Bryophyta ', ' Bryophyte ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Ventricular ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' patient population ', ' arm ', ' clinical predictors ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' study population ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' cardiac implant ', ' kidney dysfunction ', ' renal dysfunction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,10199037,K25HL152006,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' functional status ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' Medicare claim ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' signal processing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' data warehouse ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' random forest ', ' Data Scientist ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2021,143762

"Predicting and Preventing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers an advanced treatment option for conditions that are otherwise incurable. Pulmonary complications are common following HSCT and severely compromise its overall success rate. The most severe end of this spectrum is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs in 5% of patients following HSCT, with a mortality >60%. As effective treatments for ARDS are lacking, developing new ways to prevent ARDS is likely to be more successful in improving patient outcomes. Two critical knowledge gaps make developing successful prevention strategies difficult: 1) an inability to reliably identify high-risk patients before ARDS has developed and; 2) an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and subtypes of post-HSCT ARDS. The scientific objectives of this application are to address these critical knowledge gaps through the following Specific Aims:  1) Develop and validate a risk-prediction model incorporating pre-transplant, post-transplant and in-  hospital risk factors that can help identify which patients are most likely to develop post-HSCT ARDS.  2) Prospectively evaluate metabolomics in patients at high-risk of developing post-HSCT ARDS and utilize  clinical, biomarker and metabolomics data to explore endophenotypes of post-HSCT ARDS. Aim 1 leverages highly innovative data extraction techniques to develop a real-time continuous ARDS risk surveillance system for patients who undergo HSCT. Aim 2 evaluates the role of metabolomics, an emerging analytic tool, in advancing mechanistic understanding of why patients develop post-HSCT ARDS, as well as whether recently described ARDS endophenotypes can be identified post-HSCT ARDS. The applicant’s long-term goals are to: 1) become an independent translational clinician-scientist leading a multidisciplinary research team focused on improving outcomes of patients who develop respiratory complications after HSCT, and 2) develop effective strategies to prevent post-HSCT ARDS, one of the most significant post-transplant complications today. The training goals of the applicant are to develop advanced skills in statistics, biomedical modeling, machine learning, and metabolomics to facilitate these long-term goals. To address these training needs, the applicant has constructed a comprehensive career development plan that includes targeted didactic opportunities in the areas of training need above, with additional “hands-on” experience in all of these areas. The mentorship team and research environment is uniquely well suited to the applicant’s needs, combining expertise in critical care informatics and metabolomics at a high-volume academic transplant center. The proposal supports the NIH mission by striving to improve outcomes of patients who develop respiratory failure after transplantation, while training a junior investigator in the essential skills necessary for his transition to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Respiratory complications after stem cell transplantation remain unacceptably common and are associated with substantial patient suffering, healthcare utilization, and mortality. In this proposal, we explore how best to predict which patients develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) – one of the most severe forms of respiratory failure – after transplant and use these clinical prediction tools to better study the mechanism of ARDS development through a novel analytic technique (metabolomics). We will then combine clinical and metabolomics data to help identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from targeted preventative interventions, the implementation of which will be the goal of

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources. We will also conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities, use machine learning for risk predictions, and implement active surveillance for devices and technologies.",Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs).,10209943,U01FD006936,[''],FDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U01,2021,230000
"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of

"mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Preventable Childhood Hearing Loss in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ABSTRACT Hearing loss is the second leading impairment worldwide. Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications and disproportionately affects individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Up to 75% of childhood hearing loss in LMICs is preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, where newborn screening is unavailable. However, most screening programs only use pure-tone screening that does not identify middle ear disease widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This is because tympanometry, used to clinically identify middle ear disease, is expensive and designed for trained professionals. Our goal is to develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs, where the burden of hearing loss is greatest and is not addressed by current hearing screening methodology. Our study team is comprised of international leaders in hearing loss, audiology, data science, engineering, user- centered design, and device development in LMICs. We have also partnered with hearX, a University of Pretoria spinout company that developed the only validated mHealth pure-tone screening device. To test this new device in an appropriate LMIC setting, we have partnered with the South African site from the Global HEAR Collaborative, our consortium of collaborators from 28 countries that is the only international research network dedicated to hearing loss. We documented the need for this device in a large cluster randomized trial recently completed in rural Alaska, where tympanometry significantly improved the accuracy of school hearing screening in a population with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. Using data from this trial and pilot funding, we are developing a machine learning tympanometry algorithm for lay screeners, and early hardware prototype fabrication is underway. In Aim 1, we will refine the hardware prototype using a user-centered design approach, cyclically incorporating feedback from South African team members during testing in a lab environment. In Aim 2, we will develop software through user-centered design that integrates the machine learning algorithm and refined hardware prototype. The resulting mHealth tympanometer will advance to the R33 phase. Technology development will be completed in Aims 3 and 4 through integration of the mHealth tympanometer with existing health information technology and an early feasibility study in 15 preschool children in South Africa to optimize device design for lay users. In Aim 5, we will validate the mHealth tympanometer with lay screeners through a clinical performance study in 500 preschool children in South Africa. This technology, developed through partnership and testing in an LMIC setting, will empower teachers and community health workers to identify children at risk for preventable hearing loss. The Global HEAR Collaborative will provide infrastructure for future studies with the proposed device across LMICs, directly addressing disparities in childhood hearing loss globally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Childhood hearing loss disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where up to 75% of cases are preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss.

"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10252902,K08HS027837,[''],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,152581
"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets.

"SCH: Harnessing Tensor Information to Improve EHR Data Quality for Accurate Data-driven Screening of Diabetic Retinopathy with Routine Lab Results Project Summary / Abstract Despite the high prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the recommended annual ophthalmic exam for diabetic patients has a very low compliance rate, only around 43%. Many patients do not seek proper medical attention because DR is asymptomatic in the early stage, and thus they miss the most effective period to halt DR progression and prevent vision loss. Moreover, ophthalmic equipment for DR exams is predominantly limited to urban areas, restricting access by patients in rural communities with limited incomes. All of these issues create an urgent need for cost-effective, widely-available approaches that enable early detection of DR. Our long-term goal is to develop a non-image-based, artificial intelligence (AI) tool for primary care physicians to assess patients' risk for DR using comorbidity data and routine lab results, which are widely available. It will help physicians recommend ophthalmic exams and individual screening frequency for at-risk patients confidently. The accuracy of our approach is close to the fundus-image-based DR detection tools, and it is much easier to use and more cost-effective. Preliminary studies demonstrated the feasibility of detecting DR with 90% accuracy. Our approach is promising to increase the compliance rate of the recommended ophthalmic exams among asymptotic patients, break the barrier to ubiquitous diabetic eye care in rural communities, and save thousands of people from blindness. If successful, our approach has the potential to transform future DR care from reactive to proactive. It will identify the causative and clinically modifiable factors of DR. This will lead to a proactive DR prevention and management tool to reduce avoidable DR and defray healthcare costs. As the next step in pursuing our long-term goal, we will develop predictive models for DR and extract training data from Cerner Health Facts, a comprehensive, relational database of real-world, de-identified, HIPAA- compliant patient data. However, similar to other electronic-health-record (EHR) databases, its quality suffers from missing values, imbalanced and unlabeled data. In addition, although EHR data are multi-dimensional, due to technical challenges, they are often examined in two-view features (either longitudinal or cross-sectional). Thus the high order statistics (correlation information) are not well utilized in healthcare analytics. Tensor information is important to optimize medical decision making and provides a unique angle to address the problems of missing, imbalanced, or unlabeled data. The progression of a disease or the outcome of treatment not only depends on the patient's current health conditions, but also his or her medical history. To realize the full potential of EHR data, this project will study novel imputation, augmentation, classification, and machine learning techniques by simultaneously handling the longitudinal information. The methodology developed from this study will help improve the quality of EHR data and the accuracy of the predictive models for a wide range of diseases. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Liu, Tieming Narratives Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness among American adults, many diabetic patients do not comply with the recommended ophthalmic exams because DR is asymptomatic in the early stages, and thus patients miss the most effective period to halt DR progression and prevent vision loss. To improve the compliance rate of the recommended ophthalmic exams and detect DR early, our long-term goal is to develop a cost-effective, non- image based, artificial intelligence (AI) tool for primary care physicians to assess patients’ risk for DR using routine lab results, and recommend ophthalmic exams and personalized screening frequency for at-risk patients confidently.

"West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute: Improving Health through Partnerships and Transformative Research Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) in the United States, more than 33 million cases have been confirmed, and the death toll has climbed to over 600,000 persons. The Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRs) are located in diverse areas of the US, serving rural populations as well as other underserved groups, including Native Americans, Hispanic individuals, and persons of color. Many states served by IDeA-CTRs have been among those hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) has been established by the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) in partnership with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) as a centralized national data resource for the study of COVID- 19. Over the past year, the 8 IDeA-CTRs participating in National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) have contributed electronic health record (EHR) data on more than 175,000 individuals infected with SARS-COV-2. IDeA-CTR investigators have led multiple N3C Domain Teams, participated in many data projects, and engaged more than 150 IDeA state investigators across the US. Moreover, N3C has served as a stimulus for the IDeA CTRs to work as a highly collaborative network. IDeA CTRs are now well poised to build on this experience to enable inclusion of EHRs from additional areas of the United States, broaden engagement of diverse investigators throughout IDeA states, and most importantly, to drive science relevant to minority and underserved IDeA state populations with communication of results to those communities. We will accomplish these broad objectives through the following aims: Aim 1 - Build IDeA-CTR infrastructure to organize collaboration among IDeA CTRs for purposes of driving relevant science; AIM 2 - Expand IDeA-CTR data contributions to N3C, thereby, increasing representation of minority, rural, and other underserved populations in the N3C dataset; Aim 3 - Provide the necessary analytic support to conduct cutting-edge big data research using a range of techniques, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), to answer important research questions regarding impact of SARS-CoV-2 in IDeA states; and Aim 4 - Actively engage investigators in IDeA states to enable conduct of high quality COVID-19 data projects (through N3C) relevant to populations in their respective states while facilitating investigator development. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) has been established by the National Institutes of Health as a centralized national data resource for the study of COVID-19. Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRs) are well poised to build on their previous N3C experience to enable inclusion of electronic health

"A Hand-held, Portable Robotic Device for Automated Venipuncture. Abstract Venipuncture, the process of obtaining intravenous access for either catheter placements or blood sampling, is one of the most standard clinical procedure performed worldwide. It is also the leading cause of both patient and practitioner injury in healthcare facilities. This is because successfully identifying and cannulating veins relies heavily on clinician expertise and patient physiology, where non-visible, non-palpable, or rolling veins create challenges for clinicians to quickly and safely obtain venous access. My thesis project is involved with the development of an ultrasound image-guided hand-held device for safely and efficiently obtaining venous access in patients. The device works by using ultrasound imaging to identify vessels for cannulation in order to robotically guide an attached needle safely to the vein center, all comprised within a hand-held, easy to use portable device. The proposed research here involves the development of the hand-held device, including 1) development of a puncture prediction software for assuring first-stick accuracy and 2) development of the hand-held robotic device for portable use and performing catheter insertions. The outcome of this work will be the groundwork for a hand- held automated venipuncture device for safe, quick, and simple venous access. Our hypothesis is that a device utilizing ultrasound image guidance and robotic needle placement will increase first-stick accuracy and safety for patients while simplifying the entire venipuncture process and reducing procedure time for clinicians. Project Narrative One of the most common medical practices in healthcare facilities are blood draws and IV catheter insertions. However, failed venipunctures and injuries to patients happen frequently because of how difficult it is for clinicians to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a hand-held, robotic venipuncture device to assist doctors and clinicians to simply, quickly, and safely obtain venous access in any difficult situations.","A Hand-held, Portable Robotic Device for Automated Venipuncture.",10461711,F31HL149219,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Needles ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Puncture procedure ', ' Punctures ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Veins ', ' Work ', ' Catheters ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Venous ', ' Intravenous ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Venipunctures ', ' eye/hand coordination ', ' hand and eye coordination ', ' hand/eye coordination ', ' eye hand coordination ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cannulations ', ' patient safety ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' robotic device ', ' human study ', ' Consumption ', ' arm ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' clinical translation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' force feedback ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2021,35045
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10460760,K08DK119475,"['Algorithms ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Penicillins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Generations ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Fluoroquinolones ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,112783
"Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy Project Summary: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones. Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown. As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples and fast ripples. If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1 Project Narrative Overall, this proposal will investigate the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs by capturing them with a new implantable system (Brain Interchange - BIC of CorTec), which can sample neural data at higher rates >=1kHz and deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. In contrast to current closed-loop systems (RNS), which wait for the seizure to start before delivering stimulation, the BIC system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these HFO generating areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implantable BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1",Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy,10290984,UH3NS117944,"['Amplifiers ', ' Austria ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Visual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' neurotechnology ', ' clinical practice ', ' neural implant ', ' brain implant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,UH3,2021,980214
"Using community health centers to mitigate the impact of snakebite envenoming in low resource areas Abstract Globally, more than 90% of all snakebite envenomation (SBE) occur in low resource settings. This neglected tropical disease, affects 2.7 million people, with 81,000-138,000 deaths, and approximately 400,000 permanent disabilities annually. Antivenom is a safe, efficacious, time- dependent, and evidence-based treatment, but the availability and timely access to this standard of care is inadequate. It is critical to engage local communities to improve timely access in remote, low resource areas where most SBE morbidity occurs. This proposal will develop and evaluate an innovative multi-modal intervention to improve SBE care, including decentralized antivenom distribution among the existing community healthcare center (CHC) network in the Brazilian Amazon. This novel intervention will integrate (a) advanced geospatial artificial intelligence to create decentralized antivenom distribution models using existing CHCs that optimizes population coverage and time to reach care, (b) a cost-effectiveness evaluation model developed with key stakeholders, and (c) a culturally relevant SBE care package containing education, treatment guidelines, training on antivenom delivery and interfacility care coordination. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct a formative evaluation of this multi-modal intervention and prepare an implementation strategy for the Brazilian Amazon, as well as prepare to scale up to other low resource locations. Consequently, we will have a standardized approach to use advanced analytics to optimize healthcare delivery in low resource settings that can be used in other countries and with other healthcare interventions.

"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health.

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC

"DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) are characterized by a localized dilation and thinning of the blood vessel, and although they only affect 6% of the population, bleeding from them accounts for about 25% of cerebrovascular deaths. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes one of the most lethal types of hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage-SAH. Despite improvements in SAH management, mortality and morbidity rates remain high, largely due to delayed ischemic complications. Although symptomatic in up to 40%, because of its severe consequences and because we cannot identify who will develop spasm, all patients are subject to extensive monitoring protocols, entailing enormous resources and additional risk for monitoring and treatment.  This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics, integrating quantitative angiography, non-invasive imaging, and clinical data, to improve outcomes for patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage by providing real time patient-specific guidance. Our central hypothesis is that angiographic parametric imaging (API) hemodynamic biomarkers correlate with vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which are associated with poor outcomes in delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). API provides a set of maps of image-biomarkers that may be combined with patient-specific clinical information to robustly predict poor outcomes due to DCI. The proposal’s objective is to develop, standardize, and validate a diagnostic pipeline that uses image-based biomarkers and patient characteristics to predict patient-specific risk of developing DCI, as well as functional and cognitive outcomes.  Our application is significant since there is currently no reliable way to predict DCI early in a patient’s course, and reliable predictions could help to guide therapy and resource allocation. To achieve this, we propose two aims. In the first aim, we will expand on prior work using a machine learning framework to predict which patients are at lowest risk of developing DCI. In aim two we will develop tools to extend predictions to functional and cognitive outcomes. If successful, this will be one of the first machine learning applications to produce an integrated prediction tool that allows clinicians to modify treatment plans in real time to reduce patient risk and resource utilization. This proposal seeks to develop predictive analytics using quantitative angiography to identify vasospasm and impaired cerebral autoregulation, both of which can be used to predict at a patient- specific level who is at highest and lowest risk of poor outcomes due to delayed cerebral ischemia.",DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO PREDICT DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA AFTER SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE,10288178,R21NS123478,"['Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' Patient risk ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' improved outcome ', ' parametric imaging ', ' Affect ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Intracranial Aneurysm ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' indexing ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Vasospasm ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Cerebral Ischemia ', ' Cerebral Aneurysm ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' ']",NINDS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2021,251625
"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10224747,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Veterans ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' ICD Code ', ' International Classification of Disease Codes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' treatment strategy ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' phenome ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic information ', ' interactive tool ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient variability ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' genetic architecture ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,479368
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,10218258,R01HL140731,"['Affect ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Two-Dimensional Echocardiography ', ' 2-D Echocardiography ', ' 2D Echocardiography ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' interest ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' patient registry ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' clinical imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' statistical learning ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,646449
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients. Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This study will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT).

"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' defined contribution ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' preservation ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' genetic architecture ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS:

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Competence ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' cognitive function ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Bias ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Regaine ', ' Rogaine ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' ventilation ', ' emotional functioning ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000
"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Impaired cognition ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' light intensity ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' circadian abnormality ', ' circadian disruption ', ' circadian disturbance ', ' circadian dysfunction ', ' circadian impairment ', ' Circadian Dysregulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' Circadian desynchrony ', ' circadian desynchronization ', ' circadian misalignment ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' patient mobility ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' deep learning ', ' circadian ', ' circadian regulation ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cues ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' Noise ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics Project Summary Epilepsy is the world’s most common, serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For one-third of patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite maximal medical management. In these patients, seizures often arise from a localized brain region, and neurosurgical interventions are the most effective treatment option. When successful, surgical interventions provide cure from seizures, and also prevent or reverse the disabling consequences of uncontrolled seizures. Critical to successful intervention is accurate identification of the core tissue responsible for generating seizures (i.e., the epileptogenic zone). Traditionally, this tissue would be surgically resected, but modern approaches aim to focally disrupt this tissue with targeted electrical stimulation (i.e. neuromodulation). Improvements in epilepsy care are now limited by (i) the inability to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone; (ii) a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying epileptiform activity; (iii) a lack of understanding of how to target these mechanisms with neurostimulation. The most common approach to identify the epileptogenic zone is through continuous recording of a patient’s cortical electrical activity to capture seizures. However, because seizures are infrequent, this approach is expensive, time consuming, and unpleasant for patients. Moreover, this approach often fails to identify the epileptogenic zone, resulting in unsuccessful neurosurgical intervention in 20-70% of cases. To address this, interictal biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone that manifest between seizures are required. Two such biomarkers have been proposed: (a) interictal discharges or spikes, and (b) high frequency oscillations or ripples. While both signals have been extensively studied, neither accurately delimits the epileptogenic zone. Spikes are specific for epilepsy, but too spatially diffuse to identify the epileptogenic zone. Ripples are spatially focal, but represent both pathologic and physiologic processes. We address these limitations by focusing on the simultaneous occurrence of a spike and ripple, “spike-ripple” discharges, as an improved biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Spike-ripples commonly occur in patients with epilepsy, improve the spatial specificity of spikes for the epileptogenic zone, and disentangle physiologic from pathologic ripples. Our interdisciplinary team will apply expertise in epilepsy, neurophysiology, neurosurgery, animal experiments, modeling, and statistics to: (i) develop a fully automated spike-ripple detector and compare its clinical utility to predict surgical outcome to spikes and ripples alone, (ii) identify the biological mechanisms that generate spike-ripple discharges using novel voltage imaging techniques in animal models combined with computational models; and (iii) develop principled neurostimulation protocols to disrupt the mechanisms that generate spike-ripples. Completion of these Aims will represent significant progress towards resolving fundamental questions in modern epilepsy research, an understanding of mechanisms in the core epileptogenic network that generate spike-ripples, and a principled approach to neurostimulation to focally disrupt these pathologic dynamics.

"Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ongoing rise in both AD and CVD has been ascribed to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. To understand the links between AD and CVD in human subjects, non-invasive imaging methods such X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are essential. Cardiac CT is one of the most powerful applications of these methodologies at both clinical and preclinical levels, but it is currently limited by its low contrast resolution. Our primary objective in this proposal is to improve the current status of cardiac CT based on photon counting detector technology and demonstrate its capabilities in preclinical studies focused on studying the interaction between CVD and AD. Our central hypothesis is that cardiac photon counting CT will provide low dose spectral characterization of atherosclerotic plaques together with cardiac function, while enabling longitudinal monitoring of interventions such as exercise. We will pursue three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will develop the theoretical foundation and GPU optimized tools for reconstruction of cardiac 5D (3D + Time + Energy) photon counting CT data. We will incorporate deep learning solutions to overcome fundamental barriers to the advancement of this technology: regularization to deal with image noise associated with photon binning, robust material decomposition to combat spectral distortion, and automated cardiac function and plaque analysis to handle data dimensionality. During the second specific aim, we will characterize the performance of our novel cardiac photon counting CT imaging using simulations, phantoms and animal experiments to show its benefits for atherosclerotic plaque characterization and cardiac function estimation. Finally, in specific aim 3 we will investigate if cardiovascular risk impacts brain phenotypes in animal models of genetic risk for AD. CVD and AD share a genetic link via the ApoE gene and its isomorphic allele 4 (APOE4). We will use APOE3/HN and APOE4/HN mouse strains that express the corresponding specific targeted-replacement human APOE allele, on a humanized Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (denoted here as HN) background. Using these models, we will first assess the impact of a high fat, high sugar diet on cardiovascular phenotypes (atherosclerotic plaque size, numbers; cardiac function measured with CT) and how these genetic differences are reflected in behavior and brain MR based biomarkers compared with control mice in the same background. Finally, we will also investigate the potential to rescue these phenotypes using exercise as the intervention. The impact of the proposed research will validate the usage of photon counting CT technology to enhance routine cardiac CT imaging applications. Our project will enable new powerful integrative approaches to examine the impact of environmental stressors to alter APOE genotype- specific vulnerability, or resilience to CVD and AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical, pathological and epidemiological evidence clearly show overlap between cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases caused by a critical genetic link: the apolipoprotein E gene. We will develop novel photon counting cardiac CT imaging and use it in combination with brain MR imaging and behavior assessments to study the impact of APOE genotype in mouse models and to provide data on phenotypic differences in these mice when exposed to a high fat/high sugar diet and the role of exercise in protecting against Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases.",Cardiac photon counting

"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Fluorocarbons ', ' Perfluorocarbons ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incubators ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' NADH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' insight ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Viral ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cardiac metabolism ', ' heart metabolism ', ' voltage ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput technology ', ' functional genomics ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics ', ' cardiac electrophysiology ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques ', ' drug discovery ', ' heart cell ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanocarrier ', ' nano carrier ', ' transcriptomics ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' stem cell technology ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' biophysical model ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,690516
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,10091381,R01AG060993,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alabama ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Descriptor ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' model development ', ' Ally ', ' Provider ', ' ward ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' virtual ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' confusion assessment method ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care costs ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' acute care ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,376860
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest.

"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Physical activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Tactile ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose sensor ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Dose ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' 2-arm study ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' fitbit ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' shear stress ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Receptor Inhibition ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' trauma care ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Trauma patient ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' microsensor ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' nanonewton ', ' nano newton ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' platelet function ', ' machine vision ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' force sensor ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' point of care testing ', ' Adhesions ', ' ADP Receptors ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arachidonic Acids ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood Clotting ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Engineering ', ' Freezing ', ' Gold ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Platelet aggregation ', ' Platelet Function Tests ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' seal ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Transfusion ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Point of Care Technology ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' blood product ', ' ']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults.

"Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT More than 1 million Americans are hospitalized with sepsis each year, and nearly one in five don’t survive. Most efforts to reduce sepsis deaths begin with the premise that patients are largely similar, and that ether moving treatment earlier or targeting therapeutics to a single mechanism will improve outcomes. In prior work funded by a NIGMS R35 award, we derived sepsis endotypes using a suite of machine learning methods inside the electronic health records (EHR) in a large integrated health system. These endotypes differed in biology, outcomes, and treatment response, and were reproduced in thousands of patients. But how will they lead to precision care? In this Renewal, we will leverage our clinical translational laboratory and remnant blood collection to better understand the biology of sepsis endotypes and explore new domains related to pathogen, microbiome, and molecular mechanisms. We will use Bayesian causal networks and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment policies over endotypes in more than 10 million EHR encounters. Finally, we will move learning online and embed endotypes inside the EHR at the point-of-care. These steps will take the science of sepsis endotypes and inform clinical decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty. By testing endotype treatment policies at the “live-edge”, we will strengthen causal inference, mechanistic insight, and learn while doing. My program will be supervised by external advisory boards with expertise in machine learning, inflammation, immunology, computational and systems biology, causal methods, artificial intelligence, and health information technology. This work will further develop my clinical-translational laboratory and cross-cutting mentorship of junior scientists.

"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches.

"Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians Project Summary The Emergency Department (ED) is a central pillar of the health care system. ED physicians and nurses are exposed to high work-related stressors in addition to disruptive day-night shifts. The well- being of the 150,000 ED clinicians in the U.S. is important for public health with significant downstream effects on the well-being of the 145 million patients that are served every year. Of the 1 million U.S. physicians, 45% are reporting burnout symptoms and the number increases to 70% in ED physicians and up to 82% in ED nurses. Clinician burnout is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, mortality, medical errors, but also stress-mediated physiological alterations and cognitive decline. Yet, the knowledge about the long-term development of burnout is limited. To effectively intervene, the timely identification of ED clinicians at risk for burnout is a critical prerequisite. This study proposes an innovative approach using digital phenotyping to discover and test Digital Biomarkers as predictors of burnout symptoms and cognitive function.  This proposed prospective longitudinal study will chart cognitive functioning and burnout symptom trajectories in a cohort of 350 ED clinicians to inform when, where, and how to intervene. We will use advanced computational methods to extract objective markers for burnout and cognitive decline from video and audio data. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that voice and speech content, head movement, pupil dilation, gaze, and facial landmark features of emotion provide probabilistic information that will allow us to identify digital biomarkers for burnout and cognitive function.  We will test the relevance of the discovered digital biomarkers and determine their discriminatory accuracy to distinguish between risk for clinically relevant vs. non-relevant burnout symptoms. We examine the association of digital biomarkers with physiological markers of chronic stress (i.e., hair cortisol concentration). We will also assess the association of digital biomarkers with the long-term job-related stress load of individual ED clinicians such as high ED crowding, patient acuity level, ED staffing, sleep, and shift schedules. This research program aims to deliver an objective, accurate, and reliable digital measure for clinician well-being. Such digital biomarkers will enable more efficient ED clinician self-management and will promote low-threshold prevention strategies. The mental and physical well-being of ED clinicians is of high value to those who work day in and day out to save the lives of others and is the foundation of a well-functioning, high-quality emergency care system. Project Narrative Clinician burnout has reached endemic levels and is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but knowledge gaps in assessing and understanding the longitudinal development of burnout hamper risk-based prevention and targeted interventions. We propose a novel digital phenotyping approach using deep learning based on a video-recorded interview about the experiences of emergency clinicans at work with the aim to identify objective digital biomarkers that predict burnout and cognitive functioning in emergency clinicians. We will determine how candidate digital biomarkers relate to physiological markers of chronic stress, and test the potential of digital biomarkers to self-manage burnout risk and promotes low-threshold burnout prevention.",Early Signs: digital phenotyping to identify digital biomarkers for predicting burnout and cognitive functioning in ED clinicians,10298751,R01HL156134,"['Affect ', '

"Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in diabetes care technology over the past several decades, including improvements in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), have led to more streamlined treatments and reduced burden for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As the field moves toward increasingly autonomous, closed-loop systems for management of T1D, infusion set failure (ISF) remains a health risk to patients and a barrier to the development of artificial pancreas systems. ISF, the disruption of fluid flow from insulin pump to patient causing loss of glycemic control, affects an estimated 50% of pump wearers, placing them at risk for hyperglycemia and life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Because modern insulin pumps are not equipped with a mechanism for monitoring infusion performance, patients may not know an ISF has occurred until experiencing symptoms of hyperglycemia. There is no existing technology capable of accurately identifying ISF in real-time, before dysregulation of blood glucose (BG). Diatech Diabetes is addressing this unmet need with SmartFusion, an AI-based platform to monitor infusion performance, immediately alert patients when ISF occurs, and help users infuse confidently and safely. Diatech’s novel algorithm leverages tissue counter pressure (TCP) and CGM data to offer a superior method for ISF detection. The company’s long-term vision is that by detecting ISF in real time, SmartFusion will improve patients’ glycemic control, prevent complications of hyperglycemia, and reduce excess medical costs. Diatech has already collected preliminary data to show that TCP waveforms can feasibly be leveraged to differentiate healthy and malfunctioned infusions. The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to collect increasingly complex and representative preclinical data to train and optimize the TCP-CGM algorithm and demonstrate proof-of-concept that it can accurately detect ISF. Diatech will pursue this goal through the following aims: 1) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and x-ray imaging data of typical and malfunctioned infusions, 2) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and BG/CGM data of failure modes consistent with ISF in immobilized diabetic swine, and 3) collect 3-day TCP and BG/CGM data from ambulatory diabetic swine with failure modes consistent with ISF. Successful completion of the project will result in a novel TCP-CGM algorithm to accurately detect ISF in closed- loop systems. The algorithm will be further optimized through collection and integration of clinical data in Phase II. SmartFusion will ultimately be integrated into insulin pumps and diabetes management platforms to provide real-time ISF detection and personalized recommendations for ISF prevention. Further, by enabling new avenues for control of closed-loop systems, SmartFusion can offer a significant leap forward for implementation of artificial pancreas technology, leading to improved health and quality of life for patients living with T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than one million type 1 diabetes patients throughout the world rely on insulin pumps to deliver their vital medication, but infusion failures are common and can lead to serious and costly complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. There is no existing technology that accurately detects infusion failures and alerts patients to disruptions in treatment before they develop elevated blood glucose. To address this unmet need, Diatech Diabetes is developing SmartFusion, a first-of-its-kind, algorithm-based software platform that uses fluid pressure to monitor infusion performance, identify infusion failures, and alert patients before blood glucose is adversely affected, enabling better management of their type 1 diabetes.",Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management,10296116,R43DK130036,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Infection ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Miniature Swine ', ' Minipigs ', ' mini pig ', ' mini-swine ', ' miniswine ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' diabetic ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Artificial Pancreas ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' irritation ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Cannulas ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' fluid flow ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Skin ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' prototype ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDDK,"DIATECH DIABETES, INC.",R43,2021,280364
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed.

"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

"Long-term effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies and using machine learning based predictive analytics to tailor treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This Career Development Award will support Dr. Marvin Langston in his transition to independence as a translational researcher. His long-term research goals include understanding the etiology and outcomes of urologic conditions with an emphasis on prostate diseases (prostate cancer, prostatitis, and lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS)); developing and validating clinical tools to improve and personalize treatment options; and implementing these tools in “real world” clinical settings.  BPH/LUTS is an extremely common set of conditions among older men and can be considered a progressive disease, mainly characterized by deteriorating LUTS over time which causes considerable bother and decreased quality of life, urinary retention, and death in rare cases. Conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. Despite a high volume of pharmacological research, there have been very limited advances in therapy for BPH/LUTS in recent years. Therefore, innovative and well-designed studies are needed to understand the long-term comparative effectiveness of contemporary BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies while leveraging the clinical covariates that can be captured in “big data” sources such as the electronic health record.  To address these limitations, In Aim 1, Dr. Langston will evaluate the long-term comparative effectiveness of BPH/LUTS pharmacological therapies in an observational study drawn from the Kaiser Permanente membership population, a fully integrated healthcare network. If well designed studies demonstrate that contemporary pharmacological approaches are not more effective at preventing long-term BPH/LUTS progression than conventional approaches alone, then personalized treatment options may ultimately provide the best strategy for reducing long-term BPH/LUTS progression. Therefore, in Aim 2 Dr. Langston will develop and validate predictive models using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data available at the time of BPH/LUTS diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of long-term BPH/LUTS clinical outcomes (acute urinary retention and BPH surgery) using machine learning based predictive analytics.  As the volume, availability, and access to electronic data increases, so does the need for scientists with the content and methodologic expertise to correctly use and translate these data into improved urology care. This K01 provides the training for Dr. Langston to meet this challenge as a translational researcher and compete successfully for future R01 funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS) is an extremely common set of conditions among older men, yet conventional pharmacological treatment strategies fail in preventing long-term clinical outcomes in about 30% of treated patients. This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of contemporary treatment strategies and use predictive modeling to determine which patients are likely to exhibit long-term BPH/LUTS progression.

"TRiPOD: Toward Reusable Phenotypes in Observational Data for AD/ADRD - managing definitions and correcting bias Project Summary Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for conducting observational AD/ADRD studies is about phenotyping – there is a lack of a centralized repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical modeling. To achieve that goal, we propose three specific aims in this study: (1) Aim 1 - Collect, normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational research; (2) Aim 2 - Develop novel algorithms to correct bias associated with phenotyping errors when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement. We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Observational data, including electronic health records (EHR) and claims data, provide tremendous opportunities for clinical and translational research for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD).

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"BGscope: a non-invasive, continuous, and accurate O2 AND CO2 sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Blood gases are the primary indicators of effectiveness of ventilation, circulation and perfusion in neonates. Every year ~ 4 million babies are born in the United States. Of these, 15% (~500,000) suffer from respiratory distress mainly due to prematurity and/or low birth weight. These babies are transferred to the neonatology intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth, for whom approximately 10 million blood gas tests are performed annually. The gold standard of measuring blood gases are invasive procedures where blood is drawn through arterial lines connected to the umbilical cord, through needle pokes of the heel (known as heel stick) for capillary blood or through a venous line. While arterial sampling provides the highest accuracy, it is not easy to perform and poses a high risk of infection; capillary sampling is the most frequently performed procedure, with the consequences of being painful and a high chance of sample clotting; venous sampling is very easy to perform with the least accuracy among all the previous methods. Therefore, non-invasive, continuous monitoring devices are essential to avoid the adverse effects of the blood gas test. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), are the most important respiratory gases, and their partial pressures (PO2 and PCO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) collectively reflect the overall adequacy of respiratory function. Conventional O2 sensors (popularly known as pulse oximeters) are based on optical spectrophotometry technology and are relatively large to be placed on the limb of the premature/ preterm neonate and consequently lose signal integrity. CO2 sensors (popularly known as transcutaneous CO2) detect the dissolved CO2 gas in blood through skin by depositing heat onto a localized capillary bed. In both cases, the blood gas measurement is at the capillary level and is unable to provide the accuracy of the gold standard. In addition, these sensors are capable of only measuring one of two blood gases. Moreover, continuous operation of these sensors generates heat and may damage the sensitive skin of neonates. Therefore, frequent repositioning of the sensor is required, and further blood draws are necessary for the sensor recalibration. Our product non-invasively measures arterial blood gas; partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2) and SO2. It is a simple wristband that can be used at the wrist or ankle. It does not generate heat or damage sensitive tissue. It continuously measures arterial blood gases (O2 and CO2) with high accuracy. Our proposed device will help reducing the blood draws from NICU babies by ~75%. We have named it BGScope for Blood Gas Scope. BGScope works based on the principles of multispectral photoacoustic imaging. Our short-term goals are: (i) to develop the BGScope device and a computational kernel to non-invasively measure arterial blood gases including, partial pressures of O2 and CO2 and oxygen saturation (SO2); and (ii) to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the BGScope on rabbits.

"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,10440236,F30HL151074,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Budgets ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' impression ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' patient registry ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Trauma ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' data registry ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' trauma induced coagulopathy ', ' traumatic coagulopathy ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2021,51036
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed health systems, caregivers, and patients for over a year. Hundreds of thousands have died, and millions more have been impacted by the threat of infection and efforts to mitigate disease spread. In response to these challenges, the Medicare program introduced emergency policies that permitted greater flexibility in the provision of outpatient and inpatient care, including relaxing rules governing the remote delivery of outpatient care and increasing hospital capacity. Unfortunately, there is limited information on how the changes in care delivery made possible by these temporary policies have impacted patient outcomes during times when viral spread and mitigation policies both waxed and waned. In this project, we will examine the impact of changes in outpatient and inpatient care on clinical event rates and deaths among older patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) living in the community. These patients are particularly vulnerable to social isolation or disruptions in their care, and might not be able to articulate their needs. Those with yet additional disadvantages such as frailty or lower incomes appear to have been even more susceptible to adverse effects of COVID-19 infections. Some care delivery changes, however, might have increased the number or quality of clinician interactions with patients, e.g., more frequent tele-health visits because of less need to travel. Thus, to examine the impact of the changes in care delivery under the emergency Medicare policies, we will address three aims: 1) To assess and refine study variable definitions given data collected during the pandemic; 2) To examine the impact of changes in outpatient care on clinical event rates, e.g., emergency department and hospitalization rates; and 3) To examine the impact of changes in inpatient care on mortality. Notably, changes in visit and referral patterns during the pandemic could impact information capture; thus, diagnosis-based definitions of AD/ADRD status, frailty, or delirium developed in the pre-pandemic era could be less accurate when using pandemic era data. We will examine these care patterns, assess the accuracy of claims-based measures, and develop prediction models using machine learning methods and linked, overlapping datasets; we also will account for temporal variation in documented COVID-19 infections and employment at the county level across all aims. Given these complex data and analytic issues, we will work with NIH’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium to improve the data resources and methods for this type of work. The information from this large natural experiment is critical for preparing for future outbreaks or other shocks to the health system, to determine which of the emergency policies, if any, should be extended, and to inform debates concerning the balance between local flexibility and national standards within Medicare. Narrative. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak overwhelmed many health care systems despite the increased ability to deliver care remotely and expansions in hospital capacity that the public health emergency made possible. There is, however, limited information on how vulnerable groups of patients fared during the pandemic or why patients in some areas had better or worse outcomes than those in other areas. The complexity of the issues and data to address them makes working together with a national consortium the logical way to address questions of how to manage future outbreaks and identify which changes made during the pandemic should be kept when the pandemic ends.",Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related

"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary: The goals of the parent PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) study are to discover novel biomarker signatures after cardiac arrest that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Improving survival and functional recovery are critical public health objectives. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical and that through innovative, multi-parametric data- driven approaches we will be able to identify novel signatures to identify distinct patient subgroups. The PRECICECAP analysis plan allows us to meet our study needs but is not intrinsically generalizable or usable by others. An ever-growing number of NIH-funded projects amass and analyze related datasets from hospitalized patients and develop their own custom solutions. Such an ad hoc approach is costly, inefficient, and threatens research rigor and reproducibility. The objective of this supplement to PRECICECAP is to develop a freely-available software platform that allows artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis of complex neurocritical care data and to provide a curated dataset from PRECICECAP ready for AI/ML. The knowledge learned here will be applied to help achieve NIH goals for modernizing the biomedical research data ecosystem by developing a software product that can handle AI/ML on this type of complex neurocritical care data. It will also allow the sharing of a cleaned, annotated comprehensive data set. Through a thoughtful collaboration between clinician investigators, data scientists and industry, we will take NIH-supported data from the PRECICECAP study and make it broadly available and easily usable. The project will deliver an important software tool that can be used by others conducting similar research, advancing the NIH’s mission to make complex data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). We will develop a series of modular functions (for example, to support data harmonization, annotation or visualization) that permit users to graphically construct processing pipelines maximizing automation where appropriate and allowing facile interaction with data when needed. We will develop a user-friendly dashboard interface to allow individual study sites and coordinating hubs to understand complex data, inspect key meta-data features, and identify potential errors. Modular design facilitates dynamic configuration of AI/ML architectures within the same interface, allowing individual modules to combine synergistically to maximize efficiency and reproducibility. The result will facilitate an open, wide collaboration between scientists using similar data. Project Narrative: Patients with severe acute brain injury require intensive care where the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs are continuously monitored to guide treatments to reduce death and disability. The data generated from this monitoring are complex and information rich. This project will develop rigorous, freely available software tools to facilitate reproducible curation of AI/ML- ready data and a large ready-to-analyze dataset from patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, which together will have a major impact on public health by advancing efforts towards data-driven precision medicine.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10412861,R01NS119825,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' cardiac resuscitation ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' natural hypothermia ', ' Hypothermia ', ' Industry ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Manuals ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Terminology ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Ontology ', ' Monitor ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' data visualization ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' dashboard ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' EEG-based imaging ', ' EEG based imaging ', ' EEG imaging ', ' electroencephalographic based imaging ', ' electroencephalography based imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' data pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' feature extraction ', ' complex data ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,329031
"Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health Informatics PROJECT SUMMARY Substance misuse comprises a complex set of conditions, often associated with comorbidities and social factors, that are the root cause of misuse and can lead to poor outcomes. Opioid misuse, non-opioid illicit use, and alcohol misuse can also lead to repeated encounters with hospital emergency departments or first-responders. Although substance use disorders are a leading cause of repeat hospital visits, our fragmented data systems do not generate comprehensive information on the scope and character of this poorly treated condition that would allow providers to improve and monitor the quality of care. Crucial social and behavioral determinants strongly linked with substance use (e.g., pre-hospital behavioral events) are not readily available to health systems, but they are important data that can be used to better train artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) models. In principle, hospitals are well-positioned to address these challenges. In practice, these opportunities are frequently missed given the fragmented structure and design of current data systems. Many patients living with substance misuse visit a specific hospital for the first time after an overdose or a related medical condition of drug use such as infection or trauma. Substance use-related conditions are among the top reasons for repeat visits to the hospital. This supplemental will expand on the existing work of the Parent R01, which is focused in clinical informatics, and build an AI/ML-ready public health informatics Substance Use Data Commons and share a novel, all-inclusive prediction model that will help guide clinical interventions and regional health policy. We aim to foster an academic-public-private collaboration to build a data ecosystem in this supplemental grant that will harmonize data across a Wisconsin regional hospital, pre-hospital agencies like fire, and public health agencies for the first time. We will build a cohort with substance misuse with linked data that are engineered as an AI/ML-ready data commons. During our one-year timeline, we will train and test an AI/ML model that can prioritize those at the highest risk for poor outcomes and uncover important biases in our data sources with input by health equity experts. The following goals are to be accomplished from the supplement proposal: (1) build a Substance Misuse Data Commons across a major hospital system and Wisconsin agencies; (2) develop and validate a machine learning tool for substance use-related health outcomes; and (3) examine model performance across health disparate groups (race/ethnic groups as well as neighborhoods). Access to combined data from hospitals, public health agencies, and first responder agencies could provide a comprehensive data resource that would allow us to reliably identify, risk stratify, and prioritize care for some of Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents through AI/ML modeling. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to establish a comprehensive Substance Use Data Commons that combines health system data with public health agency data for a platform designed for machine learning activities to provide health system and public policy leaders guidance on clinical interventions and regional health policy change. We anticipate that the research proposed will surface important biases and lead to novel tools in artificial intelligence that leverage both the electronic health records (EHR) and pre-hospital data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Emergency Medical Services. Ultimately, the tools developed from this proposal will be used to address NIH's special research interest (NOT-OD-21-094) to support collaborations that bring together expertise in biomedicine, data management, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to make NIH-supported data useful and usable for AI/ML analytics",Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health

"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10379705,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' mortality ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' programs ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Opioid Rotation ', ' Narcotic Rotation ', ' Narcotic Substitution ', ' Narcotic Switching ', ' Opioid Substitution ', ' Opioid Switching ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' commercialization ', ' FDA approved ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' relapse risk ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' overdose risk ', ' methadone treatment ', ' methadone maintenance ', ' methadone maintenance program ', ' methadone maintenance therapy ', ' methadone maintenance treatment ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to leverage deep-learning algorithms on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy with high mortality and morbidity. Although numerous risk factors have been identified, PDAC is most often found in later stages when effective treatments are not feasible or their survival benefit is limited. In this R21, we aim to develop novel structured methodologies for systematically incorporating feature grouping strategy from expert domain knowledge into the training procedure of deep-learning algorithms for improving PDAC diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis for this study is that the groups of highly correlated variables will combine to form superior and interpretable predictors compared to individual clinical variables (current proposal). Furthermore, these new predictors represented by the group of related data will be useful for other downstream tasks such as risk factor identification via causal discovery (future research). The proposed research presents an innovative approach towards unifying human and artificial intelligence, using explainable algorithms to build interpretable prediction models, in contrast to conventional deep-learning algorithms which are non-traceable by humans due to their black-box nature. An optimal strategy for creating composite (grouped) variables should maximize both predictive power as well as human-interpretability. We will thus explore a variety of grouping strategies relying heavily on human-expert knowledge (e.g. clinical workflows) as well as auto-correlation tests. An effective grouping strategy will allow our prediction model to learn the relative importance of both individual measurements as well as interpretable groups of measurements in predicting PDAC. Examples in the literature show that such grouped predictors often have superior predictive power compared to their individual components, which can be attributed to the mutual information shared within the group. Different types of explainable (attention) neural networks may also be applied depending on the group characteristics to further improve interpretability as well as prediction accuracy. We believe that similar methodologies applied to predictive modeling in healthcare data have the potential to fundamentally advance clinical decision making with improved model interpretability. The success of this proposal will be leveraged in a larger ongoing project which aims to establish new causal relationships between various risk factors associated with PDAC. This involves an advanced graph-based approach for building interpretable models. Our direct application of causal discoveries in the future research will be a program for collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) for PDAC early diagnosis. The goal of this proposal is to develop new protocols for the early detection of pancreatic cancer using a novel strategy for combining human-expert knowledge with deep-neural embeddings. Our study involves a structured exploration of feature grouping strategies using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to develop predictive and potentially insightful deep learning models. We will be able to propose new predictors represented by groups of related data that are expected to have superior predictive ability for improving pancreatic cancer diagnosis.",Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer,10317236,R21CA265400,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Statistical Study ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' direct application ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' electronic structure ', ' data format ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' Data Analytics ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' feature extraction ', ' pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model ', ' PDA model ', ' PDAC Model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,176874
"Use of a Novel Toilet Seat to Passively Collect Digital Biomarkers in Assisted Living Settings ABSTRACT In senior living facilities, some of the most common health related problems stem from the GI tract and urinary system including Clostridium difficile Infections (CDI), Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), Constipation and Colon Cancer. The best way to lower costs and treat these conditions effectively is early diagnosis and treatment. Current clinical management for these conditions, as well as many others, include monitoring of specific excreta characteristics including urine color, urination frequency, urine duration, stool color, stool frequency and stool consistency. These logs are the best tool doctors currently have to screen for conditions such as UTIs, infectious diarrhea, dehydration, chronic kidney disease, GI bleeding, GU surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and constipation, that can lead to hospitalizations and readmissions. However, these logs are on average 61% inaccurate at reporting adverse episodes such as diarrhea. Toi Labs has developed the patented TrueLoo technology to take pictures of excreta and, using machine learning algorithms, classify the toileting event using Digital Biomarkers (DBMs). The ability to create an excreta log to accurately deliver detailed information to doctors and healthcare providers can revolutionize healthcare by notifying when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. This novel, low-cost approach of machine learning and image identification technology that requires no change in behavior of the user will enable currently undetectable links between medical records and specific excreta patterns. In the future, the machine learning algorithm may be able to determine links between these excreta logs and the onset of specific diseases. In this study we will be collecting manual excreta records and automated TrueLoo digital excreta records in memory care and assisted living facilities, and compare them against each other and against patients’ deidentified medical records. We will determine correlative data between excreta logs and adverse events to establish conditional threshold for each type of adverse event and, using ML, try and establish individual conditional thresholds for reporting to caregiving staff. We will compare the manual and digital logs to assess the difference between speed of adverse episode identification when using TrueLoo as compared to manual logs. NARRATIVE (max 3 sentences) Assisted living facilities and memory care facilities have a high rate of health problems stemming from GI tract and urinary system issues including diarrhea, constipation, urinary tract infections, and colon cancer to name a few. The ability to create a digital bowel movement and urine log to accurately inform doctors and healthcare providers detailed and correct information can revolutionize healthcare by providing information on when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary.

"Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL) remains the limiting factor for achieving optimal glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with nocturnal hypoglycemia being particularly dangerous. Nocturnal hypoglycemia may result in physical injury, poor sleep quality, fear of hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia unawareness. Severe episodes can cause seizures and unconsciousness requiring emergency care, and even death (dead in bed syndrome). While automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have shown benefits in glucose control during the night, nighttime hypoglycemia still occurs. Moreover, many people with T1D manage their glucose with continuous subcutaneous infusion pump (CSII) therapy or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) therapy. Data updated between 2013 and 2014 from 16,061 individuals with T1D participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry showed that approximately 40% participants managed their glucose with MDI. In this project, we propose to develop and evaluate a personalized decision support tool that collects and analyzes glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and physical activity data to predict at bedtime the likelihood of overnight hypoglycemia and recommend a proactive carbohydrate intervention to substantially reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. In the engineering development phase of the project, we will use unique datasets of time-matched glucose management data (i.e., continuous glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and exercise) from pump, closed- loop and MDI users to extract information about the major contributors to nocturnal hypoglycemia risk and train a population-based prediction model that will be personalized over time to better capture inter-subject variability. We will design a bedtime intervention consisting of a bedtime smart snack with variable nutrient content that can prevent nighttime hypoglycemia. Snacks will vary by macronutrient content and size to optimize time to peak post-prandial glycemia that will match the timing to predicted episode of hypoglycemia. We will conduct a randomized cross-over study to evaluate our smartphone-based decision support tool on a cohort of 20 people with T1D who are MDI users and are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia. Participants will be randomly assigned to either first use CGM only (control period) followed by a smartphone- based decision support tool + nocturnal hypoglycemia intervention (intervention period), or vice-versa. The control and intervention periods will have a duration of three weeks each. We will measure the effect of the intervention by comparing the percent time in nocturnal hypoglycemia during the control period vs. the intervention period. We will also retrospectively measure the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia using data from the control period. We expect that the proposed bedtime intervention will lead to a significant reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia overnight of at least 50% reduction relative to baseline. Project Narrative Nocturnal hypoglycemia is one of the most challenging side effects of insulin-intensive diabetes therapy and accounts for more than 50% of level 2 hypoglycemia events (glucose < 54 mg/dL). Despite new glucose sensing technologies and automated insulin delivery systems, nocturnal hypoglycemia is a common problem for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with potentially fatal consequences as symptoms and sensor alarms may not be detected while sleeping. We propose to design a personalized decision support tool to accurately predict and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia in people with T1D who are using either multiple daily insulin injections, pumps, or closed-loop control; and we will evaluate the developed machine learning based prediction models and a smart snack bedtime intervention within a clinical study involving people on multiple daily insulin injections therapy.",Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,10373516,R21DK128582,"['compare intervention ', ' poor sleep ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Sleep ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Update ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' hypoglycemia unawareness ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' support tools ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Injections ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' side effect ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,162600
"CICADA: clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning of AD/ADRD Project Summary This proposal seeks support for developing advanced clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The proposed project directly addresses the areas of emphasis in PAR-20-156 to “develop computational methods such as artificial intelligence/machine learning to investigate new uses of FDA-approved drugs or candidate drugs from failed Phase II/Phase III clinical trials through analysis of multimodal data.” The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug repositioning of AD/ADRD. Specifically, we will develop statistical methods and ontology technology to extract drug-repositioning signals from multidimensional data (e.g., pharmacy-linked genetic data and biobank data, historical trials, and EHR data). The proposed framework is novel because it integrates advanced statistical inference procedures with semantic technology for data-driven and reproducible drug repositioning for AD/ADRD. We have three aims: We have three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop signal detection methods using multi-modal data (pharmacy-linked genetic data, genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data, and BioBank data). Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs via historical trials and EHR data. Aim 3: Develop novel semantic and natural language processing (NLP) methods for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction. The success of this project will lead to novel computational methods, KG, and software for facilitating drug repositioning for AD/ADRD based on multimodal data. If successful, the proposed method could identify novel drug repositioning signals and generate novel hypotheses for prevention and treatment intervention of treat AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals. This project is novel for integrating evidence synthesis methods with signal detection methods using advanced multimodal modeling, and it is potentially transformative for advancing prevention and treatment for AD/ADRD.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",10268162,R18HS026886,[''],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2021,444010
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19

"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Quick Test for Liver Function ', ' Quick Test ', ' Caring ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' suburb ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Dementia rating scale ', ' Clinical dementia rating scale ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cost effective ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' patient screening ', ' societal costs ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', "" Alzheimer's disease therapeutic "", "" Alzheimer's therapeutic "", ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978
"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10265522,R01HS027811,[''],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386126
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10266775,R61AG069770,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Printing ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' support tools ', ' Theory of Change ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2021,581392
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10221055,R01LM013325,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Morality ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Physicians ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Right to Treatments ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Societies ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Drops ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' network architecture ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,232216
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and

"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients.

"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.

"Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting urinary continence status with sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin treatments,10141226,K01DK121866,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Animals ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nocturia ', ' Nycturia ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Residual volume ', ' Testing ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urodynamics ', ' Urology ', ' Woman ', ' Urinary Retention ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' alpha Toxin ', ' α-Toxin ', ' Measurement ', ' Anti-Cholinergics ', ' Anticholinergic Agents ', ' Anticholinergics ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic Human Experimentation ', ' Therapeutic Research ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Botox ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Overactive Bladder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' shared decision making ', ' Regimen ', ' signal processing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' infection risk ', ' feature selection ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,K01,2021,137785
"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,10228607,R01AI150295,"['Tegretol ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dermatology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Administration Routes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eosinophilia ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ', "" Lyell's Syndrome "", ' Nonstaphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class I ', ' Class I Antigens ', ' Class I Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Complex Class 1 ', ' MHC Class I Molecule ', ' MHC Class I Protein ', ' MHC class I antigen ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class 1 ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Mission ', ' Monobactams ', ' Lactam Antibiotics ', ' Monobactam Antibiotics ', ' Monocyclic beta-Lactams ', ' beta lactam antibiotic ', ' Morbidity -

"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

In this study, we will use machine learning and predicting modeling and modern causal inference methods to determine which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive systolic blood pressure treatment and if angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)- vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-based antihypertensive medication regimens have greater beneficial effects on cognitive and brain structure outcomes, independent of their similar BP lowering effects.",Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens,10225636,R01AG065805,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Angiotensin II Receptor ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Animals ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium Channel Blockers ', ' Calcium Channel Blocking Drugs ', ' Exogenous Calcium Antagonists ', ' Exogenous Calcium Blockaders ', ' Exogenous Calcium Inhibitors ', ' calcium antagonist ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diuretics ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' brain volume ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' active comparator ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' comparative ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' secondary analysis ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' blood pressure intervention ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,671692
"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return. Project Narrative As part of the eMERGE IV (E4) Network clinical trial, we propose to develop 5, and investigate the implementation of 15, “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a large set of diverse participants.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endocrine System Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases and Manifestations ', ' endocrine disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colorado ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design The primary purpose of this project is to develop new metrics and mechanisms for the evaluation of conflicts of interest (COI) risks in the biomedical research enterprise. The innovation in COI risk evaluation and communication will draw on a shift away from the conceptualization of COI as a problem of individual researchers toward an understanding of COI as network phenomena. The pressing problems of COI and the bias it inculcates stem not from individuals but from the aggregation of COI across networks of researchers and funders. The research team will leverage machine-learning and high performance computing to (1) track the circulation of COI within biomedical decision networks, and (2) evaluate the extent to which certain conflict network profiles predict increased risks of patient harm. The team will test candidate COI metrics with U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Events Reporting System drug safety data. Using these data as a foundation, this project will also (3) develop and evaluate strategies for communicating COI risks of bias designed to safeguard against the perverse outcomes in current disclosure practices. The results of this research will underwrite novel evidence-based recommendations for COI policies in biomedical research as well as recommendations for more effective disclosure practices. To achieve these aims, this project will leverage machine-learning to identify systemic COI networks within the biomedical research enterprises for specific drug products. The research team will then evaluate to what extent network metrics predict relative increases in adverse event rates and severity for identified products. Concerns over the potential effects of industry funding and COI have been a recurrent feature in the study of the biomedical research enterprise and related clinical practice. Empowering researchers and policymakers with evidence-based approaches for the management of COIs in networks of research is essential for safeguarding the study of health and medicine and reducing the risk of negative effects on the practice of science and patients who rely on that science.","A Network Science Approach to Conflicts of Interest: Metrics, Policies, and Communication Design",10202242,R01GM141476,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Communication ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fees ', ' Industry ', ' Ink ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Conflict of Interest ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' New Drug Approvals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Committee Members ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' financial relationship ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,215960
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE).

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10251921,R01HS027375,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,490881
"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"Commercializing In-Home Supportive Technolgy for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias, or mild cognitive impairment is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including declines in mental and physical health, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects can compromise care quality for people with dementia (PWD). Empirically-supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms and pathways shown to connect troublesome behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers; (b) make low demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy; (c) can be personalized and adapted to the needs of different caregivers and PWDs as they change over time; and (d) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) application, we seek support for technical assistance and late stage research and development activities prior to the commercial launch of People Power Caregiver (PPCg). PPCg consists of a hardware system (sensors, monitoring devices, wearables), apps, and cloud services that combine Internet-of- Things (i.e., devices that communicate automatically over the internet) technologies with machine learning algorithms that run in the home and in the cloud to create a more supportive home environment for caregivers and people in their care. PPCg was developed with support from an SBIR Fast Track award to People Power Company and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (BPL) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology. BPL has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWDs and their caregivers for almost 20 years. CRP funding would enable us to commercialize PPCg successfully by supporting three specific aims: Aim 1: Increase PPCg accessibility. We will develop new versions of PPCg and conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in underserved populations that evaluate effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction in rural homes (Study 1) and Spanish language homes (Study 2). Aim 2: Increase PPCg support for wearable devices. We will evaluate PPCg with two wearable devices that monitor PWD movement and location, analyzing CareActive watch data (Study 3) as a way of improving alerting of worrisome events (e.g., wandering), and conducting an RCT with Apple watches (Study 4) to determine effects on caregiver health, well-being, and user satisfaction. Aim 3: Readying People Power for commercializing PPCg. To prepare People Power to commercialize PPCg successfully, we will: (a) add Spanish-speaking customer service staff; (b) increase intellectual property protection by filing 5 non-provisional PPCg patent applications; and (c) partner with companies that serve large numbers of older customers (e.g., telecom companies and utilities) and have deep senior care expertise (e.g., professional caregiver agencies) to market and distribute PPCg. Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Commercializing assistive technology that monitors worrisome behaviors, improves safety, and reduces social isolation in the home environment can improve the lives of caregivers and people with dementia worldwide.",Commercializing In-Home Supportive Technolgy for Dementia Caregivers,10259751,SB1AG059458,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Intellectual Property ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' monitoring device ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' psychoeducation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' commercialization ', ' loved ones ', ' community setting ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' Cloud Service ', ' Internet of Things ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Apple watch ', ' applewatch ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' emotional functioning ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,SB1,2021,1489745
"Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine ABSTRACT Despite annual investments of >$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products, and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting, labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities, but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies, mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria. Malaria claims upwards of 600,000 human lives each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials. The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based crucially involves a currently labor-intensive process of mosquito salivary gland extraction entirely by manual dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first introduce an interim semi-automated dissection fixture for this process. In parallel efforts, incorporating automation in key steps of mosquito decapitation, and extraction of glands will lead to greater efficiencies, reduce timeframes, greatly reduce training times, mitigate human error and operator fatigue while maintaining product purity and quality that is thought to underlie an incredible safety record of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines. These outcomes will accelerate Sanaria’s march to licensure and production of commercial-scale volumes required to meet demand for post-licensure distribution to populations with greatest need, world- wide.",Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine,10258416,R44AI134500,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Automation ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dissection ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' cGMP ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Licensure ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Needles ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Production ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Stainless Steel ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Decapitation ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Body part ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' phase III protocol ', ' tool ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Combs ', ' Comb animal structure ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Sporozoites ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Microdissection ', ' Devices ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Gland ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Authorization ', ' Permission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' fight against ', ' feeding ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Plasmodium falciparum vaccine ', ' PfSPZ Vaccine ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' cGMP production ', ' protective efficacy ', ' process optimization ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Geometry ', ' Injections ', ' human error ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' robotic system ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",R44,2021,934579
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10238833,R61AG068951,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-economic disparity ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' regression trees ', ' feature selection ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2021,283016
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Development ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Right Ventricular Function ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Right ventricular structure ', ' Right Ventricles ', ' Right Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' Nature ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ', ' Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' performance tests ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Ventricular ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' pulmonary arterial hypertension ', ' pulmonary artery hypertension ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' hands on research ', ' Data Science ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' study population ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Predicting Short- and Long-term Future Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation from Single-Lead ECG in Normal Sinus Rhythm with an Explainable Deep Learning Model. Project Summary/Abstract More than 30 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, another 13% of individuals with AF are left undiagnosed. People with AF have a five-fold increased risk of stroke with up to one-third of all strokes shown to be related to AF. Timely administration of appropriate preventative therapies, especially anticoagulants, can significantly decrease the complications of AF, including strokes, by 65% and mortality by 30%. Digital health technologies offer new approaches to identify individuals with undiagnosed AF, in particular paroxysmal AF (PAF), characterized by occasional episodes of limited duration, for whom a 10-second 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed in the clinical setting is unlikely to overlap with an AF event. Continuous monitoring is promising, but still costly and burdensome for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk. To maximize the diagnostic yield of these technologies, we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from a single-lead ECG during normal sinus rhythm. Only recently it was shown that it is possible to predict the future occurrence of AF from 12-lead ECGs in normal sinus rhythm collected in a clinical setting. Here, we propose to predict the occurrence of AF with commercially available single- lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting. To achieve this goal, we will analyze retrospectively the raw single-lead ECG data of 10,000+ individuals with PAF over 14 days of monitoring. Validation work will then be carried out in a unique set of 1,718 asymptomatic individuals who participated in the prospective mSToPS clinical trial of AF screening (mean age 73), with full clinical information and co-morbidities. The three aims of this project are:  1. Compute the probability of a future AF event in the short-term for an individual in normal sinus rhythm using classic single-lead ECG features and representation learning based features.  2. Develop a method for long-term prediction of AF onset by evaluating individuals with AF detected in 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial monitored period of normal sinus rhythm and by validating the algorithms using the mSToPS dataset with 3 years of clinical follow-up and annotated co-morbidities.  3. Develop a technique to provide a preliminary interpretation of representation learning features for time-series data applied to the short- and long-term prediction. This retrospective study will develop and optimize new predictive techniques from single-lead ECGs, available through consumer devices, with the goal of identifying individuals at high risk of developing AF. A future direction to build on from this study's results would include a prospective study of AF prediction using consumer single-lead ECG to improve clinical outcomes.

"Personalized Predictions for Glaucoma Progression Using Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Health Records Project Summary/Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 60 million people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's success in becoming an independent clinician-investigator integrating ophthalmology and informatics. Project Narrative/Public Health Statement: This project is relevant to public health in focusing on developing and evaluating predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression, which are necessary to tailor treatment approaches to individual glaucoma patients' needs and achieve optimal treatment outcomes to prevent blindness. The powerful artificial intelligence techniques we will develop and use for large-scale data from electronic health records can be extended to include a wide variety of data sources and shared with the research and clinical community to answer ophthalmic questions in many domains.

"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35) PROJECT SUMMARY The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2) monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots, determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions. This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers. The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions, and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way.

"Precision Medicine Approach to Glucocortisteroids in Sepsis PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis is a disorder that contributes to approximately 1 in 3 hospital deaths in the United States and 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Advancing sepsis management has been challenging in part due to the heterogeneity of septic patients in demographics, comorbidities, infectious source, microbiologic etiology, and level of organ dysfunction. Our group has previously identified sepsis subclasses that differ in prognosis and response to treatment, suggesting that precision medicine may improve sepsis care. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used in septic patients despite inconsistent results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and they are an ideal candidate to develop a precision medicine approach. Recently, two of the largest RCTs ever conducted to test efficacy of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS and ADRENAL) also demonstrated conflicting results. Reconciling discordant results between trials has proved challenging with traditional methods but may be facilitated by state-of-the-art computational approaches which incorporate machine learning to estimate the conditional average treatment effect based on individual covariate patterns. In this proposal, we will create a ‘knowledge network’ using clinical and biologic data from 4 RCTs of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS, ADRENAL, ESCAPe, HYPRESS) and electronic health record data (Sepsis Endotyping in Emergency Care project). In Aim 1, we will utilize unsupervised and supervised learning approaches using clinical data from RCTs to characterize heterogeneity of treatment effect, identify subclasses that benefit, and develop a treatment policy to reduce 90-day mortality. In Aim 2, we will use causal Bayesian modeling approaches that incorporate RCT and EHR data to identify effect modifiers and confounders of GC therapy and mortality. We will use these results to develop a treatment policy to reduce 90-day mortality. Secondary analyses will compare RCT-only policies in Aim 1 to RCT-EHR policies in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will perform cytokine assays and RNAseq using samples from the ADRENAL, ESCAPe, and HYPRESS trials to identify endotypes that benefit from GCs. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of clinical trialists, biostatisticians, computational biologists, and critical care specialists with an established track record of collaboration for this proposal. Successful completion of our Aims will reconcile discordant results of prior RCTs testing GCs in sepsis, develop a treatment policy that can be deployed in EHRs, and improve design of future RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized medicine holds the promise of improving care for patients with severe infections (sepsis). Glucocorticoids (often referred to as steroids) are commonly used in the treatment of septic patients, but it is unclear which patients benefit and which patients may be harmed. We will use datasets and blood samples from several US and international studies with novel machine learning assisted mathematical techniques to develop approaches that will help doctors personalize steroids for septic patients.",Precision Medicine Approach to Glucocortisteroids in Sepsis,10181350,R01GM141081,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' cytokine ', ' Specialist ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' treatment effect ', ' pre-clinical therapy ', ' preclinical therapy ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' demographics ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' secondary analysis ', ' clinical decision support ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,663908
"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Privatization ', ' Reading ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Device Designs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Food Patterns ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes Abstract Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus (hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE). Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe between group differences in HbA1c, β-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out- of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in β- cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing, the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease progression in those with early-stage T2D. Project Narrative Limiting blood sugar peaks following meals is an important treatment goal in the management of type 2 diabetes, but evidence is mixed regarding the best dietary approach to achieve this goal. One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations may fail to limit blood sugar peaks because individuals differ greatly in their blood sugar responses to the very same foods. In this study we will compare two Mediterranean-type diabetic diets, one that has been standardized and one that has been personalized using a gut microbiome-based algorithm to limit blood sugar peaks

"Developing and Evaluating a Machine-Learning Opioid Prediction & Risk-Stratification E-Platform (DEMONSTRATE) Project Summary/Abstract An unprecedented rise in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health crisis in the US. In response, health systems, payers, and policy makers have developed or adopted measures and programs to target individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. However, significant gaps exist in the current approaches to identify individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. First, the definition of ‘high-risk’ currently used by payers and health systems varies widely (ranging from high opioid dose to the number of pharmacies or prescribers a patient has visited). Second, little is known about how accurately these measures truly identify patients with overdose or OUD, and there is some evidence showing they perform poorly, missing 70% to 90% of individuals with an actual OUD diagnosis or overdose. Third, our NIDA-funded work (R01DA044985) using national Medicare and Pennsylvania Medicaid claims data has shown that machine-learning algorithms can achieve better performance for risk prediction for opioid overdose and OUD. Thus, the immediate next step is to expand our algorithms to other data sources (e.g., electronic health records [EHR]), as well as to apply state-of- the-art longitudinal neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to further improve prediction accuracy. In addition, we aim to translate these risk scores into a clinical decision tool to be used by health care systems to automatically analyze and visualize the relevant information regarding risk prediction and stratification for opioid overdose or OUD, using either claims data, EHR data, or both in real time. Leveraging our NIDA-funded work on developing machine-learning algorithms to predict opioid overdose and OUD, we propose to “develop and evaluate a machine-learning opioid prediction & risk-stratification e- platform (DEMONSTRATE)” that can be used by health care systems to identify patients at high risk for opioid overdose and OUD. We have 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will refine and validate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose/OUD using 3 different datasets (i.e., 2011-2020 Florida all-payer EHR, Florida Medicaid claims, and Florida Medicaid claims linked with EHR data) from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. We will expand our current algorithms by applying state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NLP) to improve prediction. In Aim 2, we will design and prototype a DEMONSTRATE clinical decision support tool to incorporate the best prediction algorithms to provide automatic warnings to primary care providers of patients at high risk of overdose/OUD. An iterative user-centered design approach will be used to enhance DEMONSTRATE’s functionality and usability. In Aim 3, we will integrate DEMONSTRATE into the University of Florida Health’s EHR system, and deploy and pilot test DEMONSTRATE in three primary care clinics. We will assess DEMONSTRATE’s usability, acceptability, and feasibility. Our proposed research is highly innovative in its expansion, translation, and application of a promising NIDA-funded machine-learning opioid prediction and risk stratification tool into a software platform to better inform clinical practice for improving safety of opioid use. NARRATIVES The proposed study aims to harness advanced natural language processing and longitudinal neural network approaches to build on our previously developed machine-learning prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk for opioid overdose or opioid use disorder. We will develop the prediction tool using all-payer electronic health records (EHR), Medicaid claims, and Medicaid claims linked with EHR data from the One Florida Clinical Research Consortium and translate the risk prediction algorithms into a clinical decision support platform integrated into the EHR system to identify patients at high risk of overdose and opioid use disorder.

"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event.

"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,10118152,K23DA045242,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' biosensing ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Evolution ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Italy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans.

"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Affect ', ' Blood coagulation ', ' Blood

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders,10074155,R01MH116269,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clozapine ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroconvulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Convulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Psychotherapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive treatment ', ' Electroshock Psychotherapy ', ' Electroshock Therapy ', ' Electroshock treatment ', ' electric shock treatment ', ' electro-convulsive therapy ', ' electroplexy shock therapy ', ' shock treatment ', ' Engineering ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary Vessels ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Endothelium ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' indexing ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Microspheres ', ' Microbeads ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Systole ', ' Testing ', ' Vasodilator Agents ', ' Vasodilating Agent ', ' Vasodilator Drugs ', ' Vasodilators ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' sequence learning ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' recruit ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Palate ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' dietary adherence ', ' diet adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision

"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis.

"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,10221548,P30AG034532,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Exercise ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccination ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Workplace ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Discipline ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Research Activity ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Categories ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' career life balance ', ' work life balance ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' provider networks ', ' Infrastructure ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2021,531220
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Boston ', ' Capital ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Persons ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Drops ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' Regimen ', ' operation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' exercise training ', ' resistance exercise ', ' Cloud Service ', ' Android ', ' clinical development ', ' Bluetooth ', ' Infrastructure ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' remote monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,210000
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart Project Summary Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Aging ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Color ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ischemia ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lysosomes ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Names ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Physiology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Tachycardia ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Glean ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Dorsal ', ' Surface ', ' Series ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart rhythm ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Ischemic Preconditioning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' preconditioning ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Oranges ', ' in vivo ', ' Cardiac Function Study ', ' Coronary Function Study ', ' Heart Function Study ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Consumption ', ' human disease ', ' optogenetics ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' cardioprotection ', ' cardioprotectant ', ' cardioprotective ', ' deep learning ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,586661
"Machine Learning for Atrial Fibrillation Ablation SUMMARY Affecting over 6 million people in the U.S., atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major public health concern. AF is costly to the health care system and leads to significant health consequences (e.g., stroke, heart failure, dementia, decreased quality of life). With time, AF patients experience increased frequency and duration of AF episodes. Random occurrence of sporadic AF episodes and the need for anticoagulation to prevent stroke make AF difficult to manage. Many AF patients seek out atrial fibrillation ablation (AFA) in order to improve quality of life and decrease AF episodes. AFA, cauterization of areas of the left atrium, is the most effective treatment for persistent / paroxysmal AF. AFA success rates vary, but many patients will not be AF-free following AFA. At leading AFA centers, AF-free rates at one and two years after initial AFA were 40% and 37%, respectively. Given the modest success rates of AFA, patient selection for this procedure should receive more attention. Sociodemographic and clinical phenotype data have been used to predict AFA response, but collectively they have poor predictive ability. The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems presents a ripe opportunity for a paradigm shift for predicting AFA outcomes. A better understanding of patient specific factors predicting AFA outcome will inform patient selection for this procedure. To this end we propose to use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for outcomes of primary AFA procedures, addressing the following specific aims and research questions: 1. Aim 1: Predict adverse AFA outcomes using machine learning.  • How well do existing risk scores predict AFA complications prior to initial procedure?  • Can a machine learning model trained on EHR data provide better prediction of AFA complications? 2. Aim 2: Data-driven AFA outcome subgroup identification.  • Can cluster analysis identify useful subgroups based on outcome trajectory?  • Are other unsupervised ML algorithms such as sequential pattern mining alternatives for analyzing  patient outcome trajectories? 3. Aim 3: Develop an open-source software toolkit. This project will lay the foundation for future refinement of existing machine learning methods as well as development of new methods to improve prediction of AF recurrence following AFA.

"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Algorithms ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Aorta ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Rupture ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' rate of change ', ' support tools ', ' imaging study ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' feature selection ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Machine learning risk stratification in patients with ASCVD: A personalized approach 7. Project Summary/Abstract Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are at high risk of suffering from future ASCVD events despite contemporary preventive therapies, and this risk has been termed residual risk. Even with recent advances in cardiovascular interventions including statins, dual antiplatelet therapies, revascularization, and other therapies, ASCVD event rates among patients with prior ASCVD remain high (>3% per year). While a disproportionate number of events occur in patients who have prior ASCVD, risk assessment algorithms for predicting recurrent events occurring in these patients has been limited. Furthermore, patients with ASCVD have a range of risk, and recent guidelines now recommend tailoring the intensity of secondary prevention treatments to the patient's risk level. Yet personalized risk prediction models for patients with ASCVD are lacking. The goal of this project is to use advanced machine learning methods to develop and validate a novel risk score (Residual Risk Score) for predicting absolute long-term risk of future events among patients with ASCVD. Novel machine learning methods can analyze complex interactions and correlations between risk factors and other traits. We hypothesize that these computational approaches could be used to develop and validate a personalized risk assessment for patients with ASCVD. This project will contribute clinically meaningful and readily applicable results to directly impact a common clinical problem with high morbidity and cost burden; namely, reducing residual risk in ASCVD patients and personalizing their treatments. The Residual Risk Score will be provided as a free clinical tool and could be incorporated in the electronic health record or as an application. In this study, we will utilize a combination of data from biobanks, electronic health records, and population studies. In Specific Aim 1, we will use advanced computational methods to design and train an artificial neural network for predicting recurrent ASCVD events among patients with prior ASCVD. In Specific Aim 2, we focus on expanding the computational model with the capability of predicting these events in independent and diverse populations. This study will address an important unmet need for better risk stratification tools for patients with ASCVD. This would aid in identifying higher risk ASCVD patients more likely to suffer a recurrent event, and could be used to tailor novel and costly risk reduction strategies to higher risk patients. It has the potential to impact clinical care for shared decision-making discussions between healthcare providers and patients, as well as for clinical trials that target higher risk ASCVD patients for novel costly therapeutics. 8. Project Narrative Patients with prior heart disease or stroke are at increased risk of having a repeat event, with approximately 1 in 5 patients experiencing or dying from repeat events. However, there is a range of risk for patients, and a clear need exists for identifying those who are at higher risk of events despite taking medication. We propose to apply new artificial intelligence methods to develop a free and publicly available computer program that will calculate each patient's long-term chance of having or dying from a repeat heart attack or stroke based on his or her individual risk profile.",Machine learning risk stratification in patients with ASCVD: A personalized approach,10114664,R21HL156174,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10178133,R01NS114020,"['Animals ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Cannabidiol ', ' Carbamazepine ', ' Epitol ', ' Tegretol ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clonazepam ', ' Clonus ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Head ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phenytoin ', ' Dilantin ', ' Diphenylhydantoin ', ' Fenitoin ', ' Pilocarpine ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Specificity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Valproic Acid ', ' Depakote ', ' Depakote ER ', ' Divalproex ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' kainate ', ' Body part ', ' Intuition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' drug use screening ', ' optogenetics ', ' Drug Screening ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Treatment-related side effects ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,422740
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteries ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Supine Position ', ' Dorsal Position ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' Sphygmomanometers ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Microfabrication ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' FDA approved ', ' sleep position ', ' supine sleep ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' motion sensor ', ' advanced analytics ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10172974,R01HL154687,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Play ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Task Performances ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Function ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' prognostic ', ' radiologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' American ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' diagnosis evaluation ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Defect ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Validation ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' quantum ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical care ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' imaging system ', ' radiation risk ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' denoising deep learning ', ' de-noising deep learning ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,773340
"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10269920,R01NS117150,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clozapine ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Oxides ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Calcium ion ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' SCN8A gene ', ' NAV1.6 ', ' NaCh6 ', ' SCN8A ', ' sodium channel, voltage gated, type VIII, alpha subunit ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' in vivo two-photon imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multiphoton microscopy ', ' multiphoton excitation microscopy ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,424577
"Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with Alzheimer’s disease & related dementia (ADRD) experience 400,000 avoidable hospitalizations annually, amounting to $5.4 billion in preventable healthcare costs. In addition to financial costs, avoidable hospitalizations increase risks for adverse outcomes, such as secondary infections, deliriums, or acute distress. To prevent hospitalizations, clinicians rely on caregivers of patients with ADRD to report any physical, behavioral, and emotional changes that caregivers observe. If communicated in a timely manner, many such changes can be addressed without hospitalization, but through pharmacological interventions, home visits, or clinic visits. Currently, communication between clinicians and family caregivers depends on the caregiver knowing when to call, and clinicians sorting through messages of various importance to find and address worrisome changes associated with an impending hospitalization. This strategy is insufficient, as it delays communication of potentially significant changes in patients with ADRD to the clinician. It also relies on caregivers’ ability to distinguish innocuous changes from those that can lead to hospitalizations. To minimize occurrence of avoidable hospitalizations in patients with ADRD, we will develop and test the first remote patient-monitoring platform, Digital Outpost, based on caregiver-reported information. The platform will contain two parts: the native Caregiver App and web-based Clinician Action Dashboard. Guided by user-centered design principles and rapid qualitative research methods, we will query 12 caregivers of patients with ADRD regarding content, look, feel, and experience of the Caregiver App. Using input of 20 clinicians through Delphi and discrete choice methodology, we will define the daily clinical surveys through which caregivers will report physical, behavioral, and emotional changes in patients with ADRD. We will also define the algorithms for analyzing and displaying caregiver-reported data in the Clinician Action Dashboard. Then, we will develop the supporting platform prototype using Agile/Kanban-based Software Development methodology and conduct a 14-day pilot study of Digital Outpost with ten primary caregivers of patients with moderate ADRD. Primary outcome of the pilot will be usability, measured by the System Usability Scale, with a follow-up assessment through rapid qualitative methods. Secondary outcome will be feasibility, measured through platform usage statistics. Upon completion, we will be poised to update the platform to include integration of other smartphone data (e.g. walking steps), use a machine-learning based predictive algorithm for hospitalization, and test efficacy of Digital Outpost in reducing all-cause hospitalization through multi-site trial in a Phase II STTR application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias experience unnecessary trips to the hospital. There is a need to create an effective method for clinicians to monitor patient and caregiver wellbeing at home so clinicians can intervene prior to the need for hospital care. To address this need, we will develop and test the prototype of “Digital Outpost”, the first low-cost, commercially-viable remote patient monitoring platform specifically designed to engage caregivers of patients with ADRD to improve patient and caregiver wellbeing while saving health systems costs and keeping patients in their own home.",Remote Patient Monitoring of Family Caregivers of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease,10253642,R41AG072943,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' secondary infection ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10254269,R01HS027363,[''],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,500000
