"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Device ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Rehabilitation Centers ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' visual feedback ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Group Therapy ', ' cost ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Rehabilitation device ', ' rehab device ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' chronic stroke ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' arm ', ' motor recovery ', ' arm movement ', ' robot rehabilitation ', ' robotic rehabilitation ', ' stroke survivor ', ' exercise rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitative exercise ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' recruit ', ' preservation ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' functional independence ', ' robotic system ', ' haptic feedback ', ' ']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,761936
"Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses. ABSTRACT People with disabling motor disorders rely on assistive devices and caregivers for many of their most basic needs. Current assistive devices are inherently limited, as they rely on (and encumber) residual motor function as a command interface. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to more powerful assistive options by directly monitoring brain activity and using it to decipher movement intention in real-time. However, BMIs have yet to achieve performance and robustness that would warrant widespread clinical adoption. A key obstacle is that nearly all BMIs to date use direct decoding, i.e., they attempt to map the activity of brain areas like motor cortex (MC) directly onto external movement parameters such as velocity. This has resulted in BMIs that are brittle: they often fail in new contexts, and are highly sensitive to neural interface instabilities. Instead, I envision a radically different approach with the potential to impact virtually every existing BMI application. The central element is dynamical systems decoding (DSD), a framework I developed that fuses advances in motor neuroscience with cutting-edge AI methods to achieve unprecedented decoding accuracy. DSD uses neural networks to precisely reveal MC's complex internal activity patterns, known as dynamics, on a moment-by- moment basis. This enables a clean separation between activity related to internal dynamics and activity related to external movement parameters. In offline analyses, I showed that DSD enables a breakthrough in decoding, predicting movements on millisecond timescales with substantially higher accuracy than the current state-of-the- art. A key focus of this proposal is developing universal, subject-independent BMIs that harness the remarkable similarities in MC dynamics observed across subjects. Using new AI methods to model more than a decade of previously-collected monkey data, we will test whether subject-independent models can enable BMIs that work nearly `out of the box', with performance that could only be achieved through massive datasets, while still avoiding burdensome, subject-specific calibration. In parallel with offline studies, we will work directly with people who are paralyzed to develop online BMIs with unparalleled performance and robustness. Performance improvements will be achieved through hybrid decoding paradigms that capitalize on high-level movement information that is uniquely uncovered via DSD. While BMI robustness is typically limited in direct decoding – due to gradual changes in the specific neurons being monitored – DSD will enable robust BMIs by leveraging MC dynamics, which are stable for years and independent of whichever specific neurons are being monitored at a given time. These two innovations would enable BMIs that achieve unprecedented performance and on- demand, 24/7 reliability for years. If successful, these studies will pave the way to dramatically improving the performance, robustness, and clinical utility of nearly every BMI application. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to restore function for people who are paralyzed, such as those with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This proposal aims to substantially increase the performance and robustness of BMIs by combining new developments from the field of artificial intelligence with recent advances in our understanding of brain function, with the goal of improving quality of life for people with severe movement disabilities.",Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses.,10246037,DP2NS127291,"['Adoption ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' disability ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' next generation ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,1451191
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9869948,UH3NS103550,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' open label ', ' open label study ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' support tools ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' antidepressant effect ', ' anti-depressant effect ', ' connectome ', ' tractography ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' algorithm development ', ' live stream ', ' livestream ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,1367977
"Circuit-based deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease The overall goal of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to develop novel, circuit based deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) based on an understanding of the changes in pathophysiological activity patterns that occur in basal ganglia thalamocortical-brainstem (BGTC-B) pathways. Project 1 (human) will characterize the role of oscillatory activity, coupling and connectivity across the broader BGTC network, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), sensory, motor, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These recordings will be performed at rest and during cognitive- motor tasks, with and without therapeutic interventions (DBS, L-dopa, DBS+L-dopa). It will also clarify the relative effect of stimulation in different functional subregions of the STN and GPi on motor and cognitive function. Project 2 (human) will explore the mechanisms and effects of pallidal DBS on levodopa resistant motor signs using MRI-derived computational models and fMRI to examine the pathways mediating these changes. It will use new sensing technology (Percept) to identify and correlate the physiological changes in the GP to worsening of, or improvement in, gait dysfunction. Project 3 (non-human primate) will examine the electrophysiological changes in pallido↔peduncular, pallido→intralaminar, and pallido→habenular activity that are related to cognitive-motor symptoms providing further network-level insights into cognitive motor gait impairments, task shifting difficulties, and loss of motivation, which will complement the results from the human studies in Projects 1 and 2. All center components have synergistic interactions with the Catalyst Project, which will support research efforts of a promising Early Stage Investigator who will use a novel closed-loop DBS approach to probe circuit dynamics in PD patients and their relationship to PD motor signs. The Imaging Core will acquire state- of-the-art, high-field structural MRI as well as rest and task-based fMRI for PD patients in Projects 1 and 2 (using 7T scanner) and structural MRI for the NHPs in Project 3 (using the first of its kind 10.5T scanner).The Clinical Core will obtain clinical and quantitative motor and neuropsychological assessments that will be correlated to physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients with externalized DBS leads and electrocorticography arrays, and chronically through postoperative recordings using Percept. The Biostatistics Core will provide overall data management, quality control, statistical and machine learning analysis and data entry into the NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will orchestrate all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts, and develop and monitor individualized career enhancement plans for the next generation of PD researchers. Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient- specific DBS therapies.

"Mapping neural ensemble computations to biological circuitry in motor control and decision making - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract Movement is the primary way in which animals interact with the world. To produce the incredibly adaptable behavior of mammals the brain must continually choose actions, then flexibly generate control signals for the body. The main objective of this project is to understand how ensembles of neurons and brain areas work together to control movement and make simple decisions. To understand how behavior is generated, we must know: How is a high-level decision (e.g., reach left vs. right) transformed into a time-varying command signal? And, how does this transformation and the generation of complex outputs exploit the precise biology of neural tissue to function reliably, despite the inherent noisiness of neurons? This goal is critical not only to better understand how neural tissue implements challenging computations, but also because deeper knowledge of these processes is likely to improve treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and disorders heavily affecting neural connections such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. To achieve this aim, we pair the power of experimental tools in mice together with dynamical systems analysis, which provides mathematical tools for investigating the function of neural ensembles. In the monkey, the dynamical systems approach has led to many insights. For example, we have learned that activity in motor cortex unfolds over time according to oscillatory dynamical “rules”; that much of motor cortical activity exists to support these dynamical rules and does not influence movement directly; and that there is a separation between signals for what movement will be made and when it will be initiated. In the mouse, we propose taking this approach several steps further by mapping the dynamical rules to specific biological features, such as cortical layers and projection pathways. In Aim 1, we will use two-photon calcium imaging to record neural activity during a simple reaching task that elicits variable movements from the mouse. We will then exploit this variability with our dynamical systems tools to identify the rules that govern the M1 pattern generator, and uncover how these rules map to cortical layers. In Aim 2, we will determine how information processing is divided into stages as signals are passed from visual decision areas to motor areas. This second Aim will employ a more complex visually-guided joystick task, together with optogenetic inhibition of specific pathways, calcium imaging, and retrograde tracing. This will allow us to compare activity in the neurons that connect areas with those that are engaged only in local processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will record from identified projection neurons and apply powerful new machine learning techniques to test two competing theories of how the brain produces consistent outputs: whether the brain suppresses neural “noise” in the output neurons themselves, or suppresses only task-relevant noise according to a more population- oriented approach. These findings will advance our understanding of sophisticated cortical processes including decision making and motor control by grounding theoretical ideas about neural computation in our biological understanding of the tissue that implements it. Project Narrative This study will greatly advance our fundamental understanding of how the brain controls movement and how brain areas interact to make simple choices. Uncovering the principles of operation in the motor system is likely to inform treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and enable better brain-machine interfaces for use by paralyzed patients.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss.

"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,10126071,K99NS115919,"['Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locomotion ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' neurotechnology ', ' network models ', ' combat ', ' patient population ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Geometry ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' limb loss ', ' lost limb ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,136242
"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cilia ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dynein ATPase ', ' Dynein ', ' Dynein Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Dynein Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Locomotion ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Maps ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Organelles ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Publishing ', ' Respiratory System ', ' Pulmonary Body System ', ' Pulmonary Organ System ', ' Respiratory Tracts ', ' Respiratory tract structure ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' sperm cell ', ' Sperm ', ' Spermatozoa ', ' zoosperm ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ', ' Chlamydomonas reinhardii ', ' Mediating ', ' nexin ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Organ ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' fluid flow ', ' particle ', ' respiratory virus ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' cilium motility ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Cilium Microtubule ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' pathogen ', ' driving force ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' biological systems ', ' ciliopathy ', ' ']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,10155611,R01NS112917,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' eyelid conditioning ', ' Electrodes ', ' Elements ', ' Forelimb ', ' Goals ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Smooth Pursuit ', ' SPEM ', ' smooth pursuit eye movement ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Fiber ', ' Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex ', ' Molecular Layer ', ' Molecular Layer of the Cerebellar Cortex ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' mossy fiber ', ' commune ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brush Cell ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' eyeblink conditioning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1275271
"An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces PROJECT SUMMARY For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop- ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004. We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes, and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all, enabling widespread development of BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, intracor- tical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by directly decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain. We propose to accelerate and democratize BMI research by building a computational simulator, implemented entirely in software, that enables researchers around the world to design and optimize BMI decoder algorithms. We expect this tool will reduce BMI evaluation time from months to min- utes, and by being widely available and open source to all, considerably increase the intracortical BMI research community.",An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces,10183995,R01NS121097,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Equation ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' arm ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,394812
"Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes, in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording. The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed- loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Direct electrical stimulation of the brain holds promise for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric conditions and in particular treatment-resistant depression but has been limited to delivering a fixed stimulation pattern and shown variable efficacy in clinical trials. We propose that one way to improve efficacy is to build a novel model- based system that adjusts the stimulation based on recording brain signals that are related to mood symptoms and modeling how ongoing stimulation changes these signals. We will develop this novel model-based system to enable personalized real-time stimulation and test it for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in human epilepsy patients.",Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders,10209839,R01MH123770,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electric Stimulation Therapy ', ' Electrotherapy ', ' Therapeutic Electric Stimulation ', ' electrical stimulation therapy ', ' electrostimulation therapy ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Moods ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Rest ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Refractory ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' response ', ' realtime model ', ' real time model ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' open label ', ' open label study ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' comorbid depression ', ' co-morbid depression ', ' co-morbid with depression ', ' co-morbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' depression co-morbidity ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,626990
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",10201782,R01NS111479,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Feedback ', ' Forelimb ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Kinetics ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Rabies ', ' lyssa ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' sensory feedback ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Lateral ', ' Peripheral ', ' Distal ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Spinal ', ' Ablation ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' limb movement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Reporting ', ' motor deficit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' theories ', ' Postural Balance ', ' Postural Equilibrium ', ' postural control ', ' Musculoskeletal Equilibrium ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Outcome ', ' Motor output ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' arm movement ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Grain ', ' Postural adjustments ', ' Postural alterations ', ' Postural changes ', ' mouse genetics ', ' ']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2021,587128
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10438259,R01NS119268,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,39187
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS).

"Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication Project Summary Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for people with severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) rely on residual motor function, inherently limiting communication throughput. Commercially available AAC solutions require daily caregiver setup, need frequent recalibration often from a technically savvy caregiver, are often unable to be used in dark lighting conditions, and can encumber or fatigue important remaining physical abilities. Furthermore, for people with progressive motor dysfunction due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even the most well-designed AAC devices will eventually fail as movements become unreliable. For people with brainstem stroke, ALS, and other disorders causing locked-in syndrome (LIS) or SSMI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise as a method of enabling communication that does not rely upon speech or voluntary movement. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our BrainGate research team provided early proofs of principle of a powerful intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people to control a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of their own arm. The proposed NIDCD U01 clinical research will further the development and testing of a fully implanted iBCI that could provide robust, intuitive control of industry-grade communication apps for people with LIS or SSMI. By leveraging the ongoing pilot clinical trials of the investigational BrainGate system, we aim to (1) improve the robustness and accuracy of neurally actuated point-and click, in part through the translation of neuronal activity from human premotor and motor cortex, (2) expand the number of input dimensions to tablet computers available via neural activity, allowing intended hand gesture commands to control communication apps on touch-screen tablet computers, and (3) rigorously compare the performance of the investigational BrainGate system to trial participants’ conventional AAC systems with respect to communication competence, information throughput, user preference and outcomes measures. By incorporating the feedback of six individual participants with paralysis, this feasibility trial will optimize a powerful iBCI for communication and will establish the metrics needed for a subsequent pivotal trial of a fully implanted, always-available iBCI communication system for people with SSMI. Project Narrative People with brainstem stroke, advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), or other disorders can become unable to move or speak despite being awake and alert. In this project, we seek to further translate knowledge about interpreting brain signals related to movement, and to further develop an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that could restore rapid and intuitive use of communication apps on tablet computers by people with paralysis.","Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication",10004018,U01DC017844,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Gestures ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Locked-In Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Speech ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Intention ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Intuition ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Brainstem Infarctions ', ' Brainstem Stroke ', ' Brain Stem Infarctions ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interactive Communication ', ' Motor ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' touchscreen ', ' touch panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' brain computer interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' communication device ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' feasibility trial ', ' neural implant ', ' brain implant ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory network ', ' long short term memory neural network ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDCD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,799415
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform

"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,10145825,R01NS117058,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Foundations ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Oxidopamine ', ' 6-OHDA ', ' 6-hydroxydopamine ', ' Homeobox ', ' Homeo Boxes ', ' Mediating ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural patterning ', ' STN stimulation ', ' subthalamic nucleus stimulation ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' motor recovery ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' motor symptom ', ' translation to humans ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,628368
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms

"Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez,10352898,R01NS119268,"['genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Horns ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,2933
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression.

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic.

"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,10246791,R01NS081118,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Ataxia ', ' Ataxy ', ' Coordination Impairment ', ' Dyssynergia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellar Nuclei ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dysarthria ', ' Dysarthosis ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Grant ', ' Harmaline ', ' Dihydroharmine ', ' Harmidine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Paresthesia ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' zona incerta ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Intention Tremor ', ' Action Tremors ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Funding ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' electric field ', ' instrument ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' particle ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' Implant ', ' deep brain stimulation array ', ' arm ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' motor symptom ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,542822
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Manufactured form ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' conditioning ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanofabrication ', ' nano fabricate ', ' nano fabrication ', ' nanofabricate ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' neurotechnology ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' safety testing ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' signal processing ', ' trigonometry ', ' trigonometric ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' animal safety ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272
"Efficient mapping of neuromodulation therapy parameters to complex biomarker spaces Introduction: The neuromodulation field has seen many early successes in converting therapies into clinical application, but challenges remain in reducing off-target effects for new indications as well as targeting therapies to ensure clinical and commercial viability. Challenges have arisen validating preclinical successes in clinical settings due to the differences between preclinical and clinical subjects leading to different stimulation parameters required. These challenges have impeded the expansion of neuromodulation to new indications [Herring 2019]. Herein we aim to show how the information in the neural signals can be leveraged to quantify and avoid off-target effects [Ardell 2017] providing better specificity for future therapies. Outline of the project: We propose utilising existing SPARC data to build an efficient method of searching the stimulation parameter space using Bayesian Optimisation with Gaussian Processes as a data-efficient way of modelling the stimulation response function. Furthermore, we will build a machine learning model for mapping neural signals into a compressed representation (termed Neural Biomarkers) in order to interpret the body’s neural signals as effective measures of organ function. Finally, we validate both approaches in acute and chronic large animal models where stimulation parameters are searched extensively through the input space and further optimised against neural biomarkers derived from the neural signals.

"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment PROJECT SUMMARY In this Phase II SBIR project, Parabon NanoLabs will complete the development, validation and commercialization of CTX, a revolutionary smartphone- and tablet-based cognitive testing platform for collection and analysis of measurements of cognitive performance (“phenotypes”). Traditionally, cognitive assessments are performed in a clinic using either simple surveys that assess only some aspects of cognition or expensive, single-purpose equipment such as eye tracking stations. Such testing lacks the frequency and precision needed to detect subtle early changes that signal the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-symptomatic dementia. Instead, CTX will take full advantage of mobile sensors (e.g., audio, video, touchscreen, and motion) to enable in-depth cognitive testing anytime, anywhere. Regular use of CTX will allow a clearer picture of each user's cognitive abilities to emerge, enabling early detection of subtle changes. CTX is not intended to replace neurologists but instead to extend their reach by allowing regular, widespread screening for improved disease detection and patient monitoring. The long-range goal of CTX is to allow aging adults to monitor and manage their cognitive health more effectively and to provide pre-symptomatic indicators of pending dementia to patients and their clinicians, thus enabling early intervention and planning. After a highly successful Phase I project, CTX already enables rapid development of mobile tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and reporting. Sophisticated analytics pipelines have been developed to convert these sensor streams into cognitive phenotypes (e.g., extracting eye movement data from selfie video taken during a cognitive test). Using the CTX framework, the Parabon team has already developed an Apple® iOS® mobile app with proof-of-principle tests for assessing verbal recall, eye movement, motor function, and episodic memory. In Phase II, we propose to develop two new suites of CTX tests for one-time cognitive impairment screening and cognitive performance monitoring, as well as phenotype extraction pipelines for each. We will evaluate tests in normal and affected cohorts to determine usability, user retention and whether resulting phenotypes enable accurate cognitive assessments by clinicians. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop new and engaging cognitive tests and pipelines for assessing visual search and targeting, expressive and receptive language, motor movement and episodic memory; (2) Validate measures in cognitively normal and impaired cohorts; and (3) Analyze and prepare data for publication and premarket submissions to the FDA. PROJECT NARRATIVE According to the World Health Organization, the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050. Existing pen-and-paper cognitive tests used for dementia screening were designed to detect overt disease, but early detection of cognitive decline is needed for proper intervention and planning. In this project, we are developing a smartphone- and tablet-based set of highly accurate tests that can be used for one-time cognitive impairment screening and game-like activities for ongoing

"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10198063,R01NS114007,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Dissection ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' H-Reflex ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Toes ', ' Volition ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Spinal Cord Stimulation ', ' Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue ', ' Spinal Cord Contusions ', ' Tactile ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Tracer ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' feeding ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' Locomotor Recovery ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' treadmill training ', ' sensory input ', ' functional plasticity ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' injury recovery ', ' recovery after injury ', ' recovery following injury ', ' recovery post injury ', ' ']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,395672
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,10074557,R21DC018374,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' premonitory sensory phenomena ', ' sensory phenomena ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' data sharing ', ' individual patient ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Data Pooling ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2021,196250
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Forelimb ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locomotion ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Subthalamic structure ', ' Subthalamus ', ' ventral thalamus ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' pars compacta ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' endopeduncular nucleus ', ' Entopeduncular Nucleus ', ' Nucleus Endopeduncularis ', ' Nucleus Entopeduncularis ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' cell type ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' limb movement ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' motor deficit ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' body position ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Homolog ', ' Homologue ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Scheme ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' motor control ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' motor symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' motor behavior ', ' parkinsonian rodent ', ' parkinsonian mouse ', ' parkinsonian rat ', ' ']",NINDS,J.

"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10266790,R01NS119268,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,432838
"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance.

"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and

"Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia Project Summary/Abstract Cholinergic neurons (ChIs) are a central but poorly understood element of striatal circuitry. A considerable literature strongly implicates ChI dysfunction in the pathogenesis of abnormal movements, especially in dystonia and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease. A common theme of these studies is that maladaptive plastic changes cause aberrant ChI output and connectivity, promoting motor dysfunction. The central goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms through which ChIs cause motor dysfunction by employing novel selective genetic and chemical strategies in a recently validated model of DYT1 dystonia. Conditional Knock Out of torsinA from all striatal neurons (using Dlx5/6-Cre; “Dlx-CKO”) causes selective neurodegeneration of dorsolateral striatal ChI. ChI degeneration occurs roughly coincident with the juvenile onset of abnormal twisting movements in these mice, and selective ChI abnormalities are also present in postmortem tissue from DYT1 subjects. These movements are suppressed by the same anti-muscarinic compounds used to treat patients with DYT1 dystonia, establishing model therapeutic validity and suggesting shared pathophysiology with human dystonia. Surviving striatal ChIs are enlarged and hyperexcitable, and receive aberrant synaptic inputs. Selective ablation of these surviving ChI suppresses abnormal twisting, implicating these cells as key contributors to abnormal movements. Based on these data, we hypothesize that maladaptations in surviving ChIs drive motor dysfunction. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fundamentally advance understanding of maladaptive mechanisms whereby ChI function and connectivity drive abnormal movements, information highly significant for multiple striatal diseases. We will first address our hypothesis by testing the necessity of striatal ChI dysfunction in abnormal movement generation by selectively restoring torsinA to these cells (Aim 1), decisively moving beyond the current association between these factors. We will determine if cholinergic dysfunction arises primarily from intrinsic ChI abnormalities or defects in how they respond to afferents (Aim 2), and, informed by Aims 1 and 2, will pursue translational studies (Aim 3) testing whether directly modulating the activity of surviving ChIs can suppress dystonic-like movements. This proposal is therefore highly signifiant because it will define a circuit-based model of motor dysfunction that will inform the design of targeted therapeutics. Project Narrative DYT1 dystonia is an incurable brain disease characterized by involuntary twisting movements for which there are no reliably effective treatments. This proposal employs unique genetic strategies to target a specific class of neurons (striatal cholinergic interneurons) that appear essential to the abnormal movements.

"Sensory mechanisms of manual dexterity and their application to neuroprosthetics PROJECT SUMMARY Manual behavior requires sensory signals from the hand, both tactile and proprioceptive, as evidenced by the severe deficits that result from somatosensory deafferentation. Three aspects of the sensory component of hand sensory function are poorly understood. First, the neural basis of touch has been studied almost exclusively with stimuli delivered passively to the skin, precluding any understanding of how tactile signals are modulated by and interact with motor commands. Second, proprioceptive signals carry information not only about the time-varying conformation of the hand, but also about manually applied forces, but proprioceptive representations of force are poorly understood. Third, stereognosis – the sense of the three-dimensional shape of objects acquired from sensory signals arising from the hand – implies the integration of tactile and proprioceptive signals, a process about which little is known. The study of active touch, hand proprioception, and stereognosis has been hindered by technical obstacles. Indeed, characterizing self-generated contact with objects has been difficult or impossible, as has tracking hand movements with sufficient precision. To overcome these obstacles, my team has developed an apparatus that allows us to measure contact events – with a sensor sheet covering the object’s surface – and track time-varying hand postures – using deep learning-based computer vision – with unprecedented precision as animals interact with objects. We then characterize the responses at every stage along the somatosensory neuraxis, from peripheral nerve through cortex. This novel experimental set up will allow us to study the neural basis of somatosensation – particularly as it relates to manual dexterity – under ecologically valid conditions. In a related line of inquiry, we leverage what we learn about sensory processing to restore the sense of touch to bionic hands. In brief, we develop algorithms to convert the output of sensors on the bionic hand into patterns of electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve (for amputees) or of somatosensory cortex (for people with tetraplegia) to evoke meaningful tactile percepts. I am one of the principal architects of the biomimetic approach to artificial touch, which posits that encoding algorithms that mimic natural neural signals will give rise to more intuitive tactile percepts, thereby endowing bionic hands with greater dexterity. Our work on artificial touch comprises three components: evaluation of the perceptual correlates of electrical stimulation, development of sensory encoding algorithms, and assessment of the benefits of artificial touch to manual behavior. The interplay of the basic scientific results and neural engineering efforts will result in more naturalistic artificial touch for brain- controlled bionic hands. PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to understand the neural basis of somatosensation – touch and proprioception – during manual interactions with objects. To this end, we measure time-varying limb postures, forces exerted on sensorized objects, and neuronal responses across the entire somatosensory neuraxis, as monkeys grasp objects whose size, shape, and location is under experimenter control. We then leverage what we have learned about somatosensory coding under active conditions to develop ever more intuitive ways to convey sensory feedback to bionic hands via electrical interfaces with somatosensory cortex.",Sensory mechanisms of manual dexterity and their application to neuroprosthetics,10240106,R35NS122333,"['Algorithms ', ' Amputees ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Bionics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Hand ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' Posture ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stereognosis ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' sensory feedback ', ' sensor ', ' Surface ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Intuition ', ' Stimulus ', ' Shapes ', ' Tactile ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' sensory mechanism ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' object shape ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Skin ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Deafferentation procedure ', ' Deafferentation ', ' Peripheral Nerve Stimulation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' somatosensory ', ' dexterity ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R35,2021,1094647
"Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Project Summary Title: Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive device-based neuromodulation technique for probing neuronal networks and treating mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The treatment efficacy of TMS relies on placing TMS coils to accurately stimulate the underlying disease-related brain target. Since TMS-evoked electric field (E-field) is affected by complex tissue structures and brain geometry, it relies on using computational algorithms, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) and finite element modeling (FEM), to estimate the stimulation site. But the relative long computation time of these methods is a limitation for real-time visualization of the stimulation target during brain mapping and for computing the optimal coil position for treatment planning. In this grant, we propose to develop a deep-neural-network based method to accelerate E-field prediction. We will develop a novel deep-neural- network architecture to predict E-field by using training data computed using the FEM algorithm with anisotropic tissue conductivity. Then, we will integrate the trained neural network into a 3DSlicer software module for real- time E-field visualization. Moreover, we will develop a computational algorithm to search for the optimal coil position to maximize the stimulation of a selected brain target within a clinically feasible time. The outcome of this grant will transform deep-learning techniques into a useful tool to enhance the application of TMS in clinical research.

"Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement Modern machine learning can fit complex models that make accurate predictions. However, understanding the brain with standard machine learning is a great challenge. A critical impediment is that it is often difficult to understand the inner workings of these models. There is thus a great need for more interpretable machine learning methods for neuroscience, in which the inner workings of the model relate to neural structure or function. The proposed research will develop interpretable machine learning methods for studying the neural control of movement. Through close collaboration with the experimental lab of Dr. Churchland, these methods will be applied to answer three central questions in motor control. In the first two aims, the research investigates how flexibly spinal motor neurons can be controlled, and how activity in motor cortex controls muscle activity across a wide range of movements. Beyond increasing scientific knowledge, answering these two questions could enhance brain computer interfaces for restoring control to those with motor impairments. In the third aim, the research investigates how multiple neural populations interact with each other to plan and generate movement. This question is relevant to many neurological disorders, in which communication between brain areas is disrupted. During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia’s vibrant neuroscience community, the applicant will receive additional training in computational techniques from Drs. Paninski and Cunningham, and additional experimental training from Dr. Churchland. This training will provide the necessary experience for the applicant to be successful in this work and to successfully start an independent lab at the interface of machine learning and the neural control of movement. While the development of many new neural recording technologies has led to much excitement, it has created a huge gap between our ability to collect data and our ability to deeply understand it. More interpretable machine learning tools are necessary for understanding neural function in health and neurological disease, to one day develop curative interventions. The goal of this research is to develop interpretable machine learning models and apply them to understand how brain areas interact with each other and how they control muscle activity during a wide range of movements.",Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement,10106091,K99NS119787,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Posture ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Intramuscular ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' data structure ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor control ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2021,125442
"Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC- BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication. Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof. Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3) machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized, adaptive, brain stimulation has the potential to benefit disabling behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity across a wide range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, but is currently limited by a lack of understanding of how the brain assesses rewards to drive actions. The goal of this project is to determine how rewards are evaluated across the frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits and to evaluate the mechanistic role of the structures and signals of this network in Parkinson’s disease. This foundational understanding will direct future stimulation therapies to reduce the burden of apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders in a precise and

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health.
