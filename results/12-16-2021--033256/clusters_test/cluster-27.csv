"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clathrin ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Exocytosis ', ' Extracellular Space ', ' Intercellular Space ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK ', ' Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK ', ' Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase ', ' Tyrosylprotein Kinase ', ' hydroxyaryl protein kinase ', ' tyrosyl protein kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tetanus ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Cell Shape ', ' Lateral ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' NSF attachment protein receptor ', ' SNARE ', ' soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor ', ' SNAP receptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Vesicle ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Growth Cones ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' physical model ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' PHluorin ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Regulation of Exocytosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' FADK ', ' FAK ', ' FAK1 ', ' PTK2 ', ' pp125FAK ', ' PTK2 gene ', ' v-SNAREs ', ' vesicule SNARE proteins ', ' vesicular SNARE proteins ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent ', ' TIRF Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy ', ' Rupture ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10226112,R01MH064537,"['Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Structure ', ' Information Networks ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' Graph ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' ImProv ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' network dysfunction ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' neural model ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' screening ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,373940
"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Endoderm ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Synthetic Genes ', ' Artificial Genes ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Logic ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' extracellular ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' self organization ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' self assembly ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' synthetic biology ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' engineering design ', ' information processing ', ' stem cell population ', ' operation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' control theory ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Drug Screening ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' precision drugs ', ' personalized drugs ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel

"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Endorphins ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Peptides ', ' Photometry ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Microscopic ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Fiber ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' voltage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neurotransmitter release ', ' monoamine ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' environmental change ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' minimally invasive ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' brain circuitry ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems.

Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time.

"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's

"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's  disease, schizophrenia, depression, and temporal lobe epilepsy. For more than a century, neuroscientists have  marveled  at  the  extensive  diversity  of  neuronal  cell  types  that  comprise  the  hippocampus  and  other  brain  structures,  yet  we  still  know  very  little  about  their  identity  and  how  they  are  wired  together  to  mediate  information processing in the brain. We propose a novel research approach that will enable us to identify the  different  interneuron  cell  types  in  the  CA1  region  of  the  hippocampus  and  determine  their  connectivity  diagram,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  circuit‐level  understanding  of  hippocampal  function  and  more  effective

"Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human Project Summary The proposed work will address a critical gap in our understanding of neuronal phenotypes and cell types by developing machine learning algorithms and cloud-based software for the integration of multiple modality characterizations large and growing datasets of cortical neurons in mouse and human. Through optimal and innovative use of potentially incomplete data and emphasis on automated morphological characterization, the proposed tools will enable richer and consistent characterizations of neurons from transcriptomic, anatomical, or electrophysiological profiling. While large-scale, BICCN-funded cell type research programs rely on the notion of unique neuronal identity which determines the cell’s phenotype across different observation modalities, overarching agreements across physiological, anatomical and molecular characterizations remain elusive. Although these large-scale programs succeeded in generating extensive multiple modality datasets, the lack of principled, accurate and widely available computational alignment and inference tools presents a roadblock to the success of the overall program. A second issue is that anatomical characterization, despite being the classical approach to understanding cell types, lags significantly behind molecular and physiological methods in terms of throughput. The research proposed here aims to address the alignment problem by building on the coupled autoencoder approach, which presents an efficient optimization framework centered on the ubiquity of neuronal identity. Importantly, the proposed software can utilize incompletely characterized data points, which is common in practice, to produce unified visualization and analysis of abstract neuronal identity. This tool will be both flexible (e.g., the feature set can be changed) and extensible (e.g., more observation modalities can be added for joint alignment). The aligned representations enable consistent clustering of the neuronal population across the different observation modalities, which is a pressing problem in modern neuroscience. We propose to address the anatomical throughput issue with an end-to-end computational pipeline, from the raw image of local neuronal arbors to the anatomical descriptor that can be readily aligned and interpreted by the coupled autoencoder software. By utilizing our extensive gold-standard manual reconstructions, we will train supervised deep artificial neural networks to segment neuronal arbors in sparse labeling scenarios. The rich set of training examples, together with algorithmic innovations, will endow superior generalizability of this automated segmentation tool, accelerating science for light microscopy-based studies. Project Narrative The prospect of addressing many questions on the function and dysfunction of the nervous system hinges on the ability to consistently identify the same cell type label for a given cell, independent of the observation modality. While much recent progress has been achieved by jointly characterizing neurons with multiple observation modalities, a lack of software tools that can consistently infer the type and unobserved features of incompletely characterized neurons hinders progress.

"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10353118,R01EB029857,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' Population ', ' brain research ', ' information processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' network architecture ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' long short term memory ', ' long short term memory network ', ' long short term memory neural network ', ' multiscale data ', ' multi-scale data ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,131945
"Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid addiction is a chronic, progressive disorder that fuels the current US epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Over the years, a tremendous amount of research effort has been devoted to understanding the biological roles of opioid receptors and developing newer generations of synthetic opioids to treat pain and combat opioid addiction. However, given the advancement of contemporary and novel neuroscience technologies, we have the tools to think beyond mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to develop improved OUD therapeutics. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in the brain and to determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to withdrawal-active MOR-expressing cells and axonal output projections, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these input/output maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes within dependence networks using hyper-multiplexed 3D in situ hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro- labeled connections. Finally, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within core regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the population activity— at cellular resolution—across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. Our models will provide formal summaries of activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure and withdrawal, and our datasets will be made publicly available as they are generated. To bridge these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since their discovery almost 50 years ago how opioid receptors facilitate the development of dependence and withdrawal at a circuit level is still not known. To address this question, we will chart the global cell-type identity, shifting connectivity, and ensemble activity of opioidergic networks by examining brains throughout various stages of addiction. By leveraging cutting-edge neuroscience technologies, we will map and profile neuronal ensembles and cell-types that mediate opioid action in the rodent brain.","Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies",10293782,R01DA054374,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Head ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' mu opioid receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' μ-OR ', ' μOR ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' endogenous opioids ', ' endogenous opiate ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' combat ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' control theory ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opioid exposed ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' neural network ', ' synthetic opioid ', ' synthetic opiate ', ' Visualization ', ' searchable database ', ' searchable data base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516298
"Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Episodic memories integrate the content of human experience in space and time and constitute the core of one's identity. Memory formation involves processing, and constructing interpretations of the incoming information in our daily lives and is one of the first functions compromised in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. With population aging, we face a “Cognitive Tsunami” of millions of people with memory disorders. Thus, understanding neural mechanisms of memory, and finding interventions that enhance these processes is a critical endeavor with the potential to improve the lives of countless people world-wide.  Although it is established that memory is critical for cognitive well-being, and sleep is critical for memory consolidation, the underlying mechanisms in the human brain are poorly understood. Research on memory and sleep so far has suffered from a gap between non-invasive cognitive research in humans and detailed electrophysiological research in animals. Moreover, most human studies are dominated by stimulus response methodologies where the presented stimuli constitute limited, discretized, aspects of memory. This approach, albeit well-controlled, is far from the rich narrative of episodes we experience. Thus, to mechanistically probe human memory consolidation, it is imperative to (a) employ methodologies that incorporate the continuous and multimodal nature of experience; (b) identify relevant neural activation patterns and how they are transformed and reactivated during sleep; (c) establish means to causally modulate memory processes during sleep.  Building upon our exploratory U01 project, this proposal seeks a breakthrough in our understanding by going beyond the state-of-the-art, and via the application of integrative and multidisciplinary approaches. It capitalizes on a highly unique opportunity to record and modulate neuronal activity of a large number of single neurons and neuronal assemblies in the human brain. In parallel, it exploits the high dimensionality of the data as an asset through the use of cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, which have emerged as promising analysis tools. Specifically, the project will investigate the presence, and decoding, of distributed neural patterns associated with memory for different aspects of experience during wakefulness and identify their reactivation during sleep. The proposal aims to selectively modulate memory via application of novel closed-loop stimulation in sleep in concert with the DL model predictions.  We anticipate that this project is poised to shed light on the relationship between sleep and memory, and its modulation from a novel perspective. Such an ambitious goal can only be achieved with unrivaled combination of experience, access to a clinical setting, and interdisciplinary collaborations such as those proposed in this project. By combining the opportunity to stimulate and record neural activity with the computational power of artificial intelligence, this project aims to offer findings with far reaching implications for basic neuroscience and contribute to the development of novel therapies for human memory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Memory impairment and disruptions in sleep architecture co-occur in various neurological disorders, suggesting that elucidating the mechanisms underlying the entanglement between memory and sleep may offer the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from memory disorders as well as promote the significance of healthy sleep habits for the general public. The proposed multidisciplinary project seeks a transformative understanding of memory processes and consolidation during sleep by combining the unique capability of direct recordings from the human brain at multiple levels of resolution—single neurons, localized neuronal assemblies, intracranial local field potentials—in neurosurgical patients monitored with intracranial depth electrodes, and computational power of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the project will probe causal mechanisms of consolidation by application of auditory and electrical stimulations—with high temporal and spatial precision— using innovative model-driven closed-loop technology, which can help lay the foundation for future therapeutic interventions of memory disorders.",Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles,10289993,U01NS123128,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Memory Disorders ', ' Cognitive Retention Disorders ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' memory recognition ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sleep Architecture ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Tsunami ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural patterning ', ' memory consolidation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2021,1478534
"Brain-wide Neuronal Circuit Mapping with X-ray Nano-Holography Project Summary This proposal's objective is to develop synchrotron-based X-ray imaging technologies to enable high-resolution imaging of brain-wide neuronal circuits. Comprehensively mapping brain-wide circuits is not currently feasible, even in small mammalian model systems, because light microscopy (LM) lacks sufficient resolution and electron microscopy (EM) cannot be applied over large volumes. Leveraging the unprecedented qualities of the new 4th generation synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron, we will develop X-ray nano-holography (XNH) imaging techniques for large-scale imaging of brain circuits. Taking advantage of improvements in source coherence and brightness, we will improve imaging resolution to allow direct visualization of synaptic connections between neurons, and develop imaging protocols that allow imaging of centimeter-scale circuit volumes within a typical beamline experiment. We will combine non- destructive XNH with EM and LM imaging techniques to rigorously and quantitatively validate the accuracy of XNH- based circuit reconstruction. We will then use this correlative workflow to study the relationships between long-range sensory inputs, local synaptic micro-circuitry, and single-neuron activity, investigating how circuits in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) support perceptual decision-making. Lastly, we will apply XNH circuit-mapping over an entire cortical hemisphere, and utilize deep-learning based machine vision algorithms to obtain a comprehensive atlas of cortical connectivity. This atlas will in principle resolve all long-range connections between cortical areas at single-axon resolution, lending insight into how distinct cortical areas achieve specialized function, and how distributed cortical networks support cognition and are affected by psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative  Mapping the complex wiring between neurons can help us understand how brain circuits work a fundamental level, but is not possible with current imaging technologies.

"THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT Project Summary/Abstract Although HIV-infected patients in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population, they are at a significantly elevated risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Such disorders are the most common neurological complication of HIV disease, with prevalence estimates ranging from 35-70% of all HIV-infected patients, and research targeting such comorbidities has been identified as a top priority by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137). While the mechanisms that underlie HAND are not well understood, numerous human neuroimaging studies have examined the brain regions that may be involved, and overall these studies have been largely successful in identifying the critical hubs and large-scale networks. However, many questions remain regarding basic circuit dysfunction within these brain regions, and consequently there is a clear and common need to further investigate the key physiological parameters that may underlie the development and progression of HAND, especially in the context of aging. It is well known that human cortical neurons exhibit spontaneous firing in the absence of incoming exogenous and endogenous input. Across a neuronal population, these discharges summate with local dendritic currents and synaptic potentials to produce cortical rhythmic activity, which is often referred to as “spontaneous activity.” Such spontaneous rhythms are ubiquitous throughout the human brain, but their role in modulating cognition is only beginning to be understood. Recently, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to show that the strength of spontaneous activity directly affects neural oscillatory activity in the same cortical area, and in-turn modulates real time task performance in controls and HIV-infected adults. Additionally, we have shown that spontaneous activity in multiple brain regions increases with advancing age, that this increase is deleterious to performance, and that these effects are accentuated in patients with HAND. In fact, our preliminary data suggests that the level of spontaneous activity in specific brain regions may distinguish age-matched HIV-infected patients with and without HAND. In this project, we will quantify the trajectory of age-related elevations in spontaneous cortical activity in a large group of HIV-infected adults and demographically-matched controls. We will then evaluate how the strength of such spontaneous activity affects local neural oscillations and real time cognitive performance. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that spontaneous activity will increase with age in both groups, and that the slope of this increase will be steeper in HIV-infected adults relative to controls, and further accentuated in those with HAND. Importantly, we also hypothesize that these increases will be associated with proportional changes in the strength of the neural oscillations underlying cognition, and behavioral performance indices such as accuracy and reaction time. Finally, in Aim 3, we will utilize deep learning methods to classify our sample into groups based on the neurophysiological metrics derived from MEG, with the gold standard being their overall neuropsychological profile. Project Narrative HIV-infection has become a chronic manageable condition with a life expectancy that approaches that of the general population, but affected patients remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive disorders. Previous neuroimaging studies have mapped the brain regions that may be involved in these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders(HAND), and while these studies have been largely successful, many questions persist about the inherent physiology in these regions, and how it might differ in patients with HAND. In the current study, we use an advanced dynamic functional brain mapping approach to evaluate the role of two novel neurophysiological parameters, previously shown to be implicated in aging, in the pathophysiology of HAND.",THE PROGRESSIVE ELEVATION OF SPONTANEOUS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN HAND (PESCAH) PROJECT,10321801,R01MH116782,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gold ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physiology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' electric field ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Western World ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' healthy aging ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' cognitive performance ', ' HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV 1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep learning ', ' AIDS dementia ', ' AIDS with dementia ', ' AIDS-related dementia ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome related dementia ', ' Dementia Due to HIV Disease ', ' Dementia associated with AIDS ', ' Dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease ', ' HIV Dementia ', ' HIV associated dementia ', ' HIV-1 associated dementia ', ' HIV-1 dementia ', ' HIV-related dementia ', ' ']",NIMH,FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' HOME,R01,2021,518570
"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion.

"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background “noise” distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world “background noise” was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10115690,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' auditory nerve ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Coffee ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' assistive hearing device ', ' assistive listening device ', ' hearing amplification ', ' hearing assistance ', ' hearing assistive device ', ' hearing device ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Presbycusis ', ' Presbyacusis ', ' age associated hearing loss ', ' age induced hearing loss ', ' age related decline in hearing ', ' age related hearing deficits ', ' age related hearing impairment ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' aging associated hearing loss ', ' aging induced hearing loss ', ' aging related decline in hearing ', ' aging related hearing deficits ', ' aging related hearing impairment ', ' aging related hearing loss ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Research ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Auditory ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Auditory system ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' signal processing ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,66390
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,10115818,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Color ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Motion ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Inferior ', ' sensory cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive ability ', ' attentional control ', ' mental function ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,530307
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['Adoption ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Posture ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' voltage ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' data format ', ' natural language ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine vision ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10242930,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Literature ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Coin ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' aversive conditioning ', ' Participant ', ' gang ', ' Graph ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' face perception ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Aversive Stimulus ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' conditioning ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' stem ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,683555
"Clear Volume Imaging with Machine Learning: a novel tool to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse in rat models This project is in response to PA-18-437 “Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA)”. Over the two past decades, there has been a large increase in the abuse of prescription and illegal opioids; this increase coincides with increases in opioid-related deaths. A critical challenge is the occurrence of relapse in treated patients, especially given that relapse episodes carry a risk of overdose. There is a need to improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms of opioid relapse, which hopefully will result in the identification of targeted circuitry-based treatments. We propose to develop a high-throughput computation system termed Clear Volume Analysis with Machine Learning (CVA-ML). We will combine CVA-ML with a rat-optimized version of the whole brain immunostaining and clearing method iDISCO+ and a new rat model of opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence to identify brain- wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse. We recently adapted the iDISCO+ method to intact rat brains and developed experimental methods for Fos immunostaining, brain clearing, and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging. However, incorporation of the iDISCO+ method to large scale rat studies is currently limited by (1) lack of ABA-CCF-comparable high-resolution 3D rat brain atlas that allows for high-resolution registration of the activity signal in the 3D space, and (2) lack of an automated data analysis pipeline. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a data analysis pipeline that will take light sheet fluorescence microscopy- generated rat brain images and automatically register them into a custom-made 3D rat brain atlas encompassing a converted Paxinos and Watson rat’s brain atlas. As part of Aim 1, we also propose to develop machine-learning methods to identify and analyze the whole brain Fos signals in 3D space. In Aim 2, we propose to use the methods we developed in Aim 1 to identify brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity (‘neural ensembles’) that encode opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence induced by imposing adverse consequences (electric barrier) that results in long-term cessation of opioid (oxycodone) self-administration. Our proposal addresses the goal of PA-18-437: “to develop, and/or adapt, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research.” The anticipated outcomes of our proposal are an open-source software package to automatically analyze iDISCO+ data of rat brains, and a rat whole brain activity map for opioid relapse, assessed using a new rat model. The publicly available software will be easy to modify and can be used by investigators to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles underlying drug relapse and other motivated behaviors in rats. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop a high-throughput computation system and combine it with the whole brain clearing method iDisco+ and a novel rat model of relapse after voluntary abstinence opioid relapse model to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse.

"Circuits underlying threat and safety Classical conditioning has been studied in many different animal models, and even in humans. However, the larval zebrafish with its transparent brain offers a unique opportunity to observe large scale changes in synaptic structure that accompany this form of learning. Accordingly, we have developed a novel paradigm for visualizing synaptic changes that occur during classical conditioning in larval zebrafish. Using this paradigm we have observed striking region-specific changes in the distributions of synapses that drive the rewiring of neural circuits that mediate threat responses. In this grant we will expand this paradigm by monitoring neuronal activity through imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators throughout the pallium (the homolog of the amygdala) before, during and after classical conditioning and extinction. This will allow us to identify cells that comprise the circuits that control threat and safety and explore their connectivity using optogenetics. We will investigate how different sensory inputs can cause changes in the activity of those cells leading to synapse change, and the formation or extinction of associative memories. A crucial component of these studies will be the recording of field potentials to capture rhythmic activity throughout the pallium and high speed SPIM imaging of genetically encoded voltage indicators to record rhythms in individual cells. By understanding the precise timing of signals that impinge on individual cells we will uncover mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity.

"Identification and characterization of chromatin regulators of coordinated synaptic gene expression Project Summary/Abstract Nervous system function requires the integration of diverse neuronal subtypes into neural circuits that elicit thought and behavior. Despite the extensive diversity of neuronal subtypes, all neurons share key features, including chemical synapses. Current models indicate that shared neuronal genes, including pan-synaptic genes, are independently regulated by different combinations of transcription factors in distinct neuronal subtypes, whereas subtype-specific synaptic genes are regulated by specific transcription factors called terminal selectors. Our data demonstrate that pan-neuronal and subtype-specific synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis. We have identified a candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) that includes two known pioneer factors, and propose a model in which positive and negative regulation of chromatin accessibility underlie the coordinated regulation of synaptic gene expression to promote synapse formation. In Aim 1, we propose genomic and in vivo functional validation to test the model that two of our candidate transcription factors, GA-rich motif binding factors CLAMP and GAGA factor, bind to the same promoters of synaptic genes to exert opposite effects on chromatin accessibility and transcription. In Aim 2, we propose a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identifying the GRNs underlying coordinated synaptic gene expression through single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-Seq. Successful completion of these studies will advance our understanding of how the development of shared neuronal traits is coordinated with cell fate acquisition, and may inform neuronal reprogramming of stem cells. Project Narrative The nervous system is remarkable for its cellular diversity and functional complexity, yet despite extensive diversity, all neurons share key features such as chemical synapses. While pan- neuronal and sub-type specific genes are thought to be regulated through distinct mechanisms, our data demonstrate that these classes of synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

"Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning PROJECT SUMMARY Navigation is one of our most foundational behavioral capacities, and substantial work using rodent models has established the hippocampus as a critical contributor to this complex behavior. However, efforts to model these effects in humans have been limited, both in scope and generalizability. Little work has explored the interaction in the hippocampus between navigation and foundational non-navigation learning processes, like statistical learning, and it therefore remains unclear how navigation processes are integrated with and may be supported by these learning mechanisms. Further, studies in humans have primarily consisted of virtual navigation, limiting applicability and relevance of the established neural signals to real-world navigation behavior. Understanding how navigation and statistical learning compete or cooperate in the human hippocampus will significantly inform models of memory systems and consolidation, and addressing these questions in a real-world paradigm will close a wide gap in our understanding of human navigation. This requires a multimodal approach, coupling the high temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG (iEEG) in epilepsy patients with quantitative behavioral measures of human navigation and learning. In my doctoral dissertation work thus far, I have used behavioral, computational, and iEEG methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between statistical learning and spatial navigation in the human hippocampus and related structures. My work has produced impactful findings via novel computational modeling techniques and innovative multivariate iEEG analyses. In my proposed research and training program, I will use a cutting-edge research method to collect direct neural recordings from chronic brain implants in human participants as they physically ambulate in the real world. Through my multidisciplinary research mentors, this experience will provide me training with novel research methodology and ecologically valid experiment design, as well as clinical perspectives, considerations, and practices for working with patients with epilepsy. In my proposed postdoctoral training phase, I will pursue a more clinical focus, returning to the question of how modern cognitive neuroscience can guide assessments and therapies for hippocampal disease. I will gain theoretical and practical experience with high-resolution imaging and data collection with hippocampal atrophy populations, including epilepsy and Alzheimer’s patients. This research program has the potential to inform and substantially extend models of human navigation and memory by exploring the intersection of multiple processing demands on the hippocampus as a shared neural resource, and how these processes operate in the real world. This work represents the convergence of disparate literatures on hippocampal function, and informs diagnosis and treatment of hippocampal patients. This program will equip me not only with expertise in behavioral, computational, and neuroscientific methodologies, but the basic and clinical theoretical acumen necessary to conduct independent investigation as a principal investigator across disciplines. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research program seeks to evaluate and extend theories of spatial navigation and learning in humans by assessing the complex role of the hippocampus. The series of proposed projects stands to significantly benefit public health by exploring behavioral and neural assays of hippocampal disease in patient populations, with the potential to ultimately influence therapies for associated navigational and memory deficits. Integration of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging methods, across basic and clinical approaches, are key components of this project which will enable empirically and theoretically supported paths forward in addressing this particularly debilitating form of neurodegeneration.",Neural signatures of virtual and real-world navigation and spatial learning,10393754,F99NS125835,"['Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Fire -

"Long-range neuronal projections: circuit blueprint or stochastic targeting?  Rigorous classification of brain-wide axonal reconstructions ABSTRACT (PROJECT SUMMARY) The classification of neurons in the mammalian brain has long been a focus of intensive investigation in neuroscience. Neurons are widely recognized as the fundamental computational elements of the nervous system, and the broad diversity of their morphological, physiological, and molecular properties may provide crucial insights into their function and involvement in disease. Long-range axonal projections, in particular, are the quintessential determinants of network connectivity, providing a key nexus between cellular organization and circuit architecture. Converging technological breakthroughs in microscopic imaging, genetic labeling, and algorithmic development have only recently enabled the high-throughput collection of large-scale, whole-brain axonal reconstructions under the BRAIN initiative. Using a principled statistical strategy, the proposed project leverages such information-rich resources to rigorously identify, from each brain region, all “projection neuron types” with objectively distinct patterns of anatomical targeting. This application will thus directly test the seminal hypothesis that the axonal trajectories of individual neurons follow specific coordination plans as opposed to aiming randomly within the constraints of regional connections. While this data-driven classification necessarily depends on the existing digital tracings, we will deploy our full analysis workflow as an automated pipeline on public cloud servers, allowing not only free community access, but also continuous refinement of the resulting knowledge as more datasets become available. Moreover, our approach allows the quantitative estimation of the population size of every separate neuron class as well as its unique distribution of path distances from the soma to each target, defining the basic temporal dynamics of information transmission. We will also determine if different projection neuron types vary in their dendritic morphology, providing an important clue as to whether input processing is specifically tuned for the intended outputs. Furthermore, we will extend this innovative methodology by applying it to complementary datasets obtained by stochastic nucleic acid barcoding, laser capture microdissection, and sequencing, yielding far greater sample sizes in exchange for lower anatomical resolution. Last but not least, we will model the discovered axonal projection patterns into a novel artificial neural network design (“projectron nets”) to systematically explore their possible selective advantages in learning and memory robustness and performance. Achieving these goals will thus quantify, for the first time, the relevant single-neuron motifs to outline the functional blueprint of the mammalian central nervous system and related impairments for the long-lasting benefit of public health. Long-range neuronal projections: circuit blueprint or stochastic targeting?  Rigorous classification of brain-wide axonal reconstructions The long-range axonal projections of individual nerve cells underlie brain connectivity and cognitive operations, and are altered in many pathological conditions including schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders increasingly recognized as “connectopathies”. Despite recent technological breakthroughs allowing the continuous accumulation of substantial amounts of whole-brain, single-neuron reconstructions, we still do not know whether these anatomical patterns constitute highly specific circuit motifs or simply reflect random variation within the known constraints of regional connections. This project will rigorously and systematically identify the first comprehensive axon projection “parts list” of a mammalian brain, quantifying for each neuronal class the population size, computational properties, and possible role in neural network function and dysfunction.",Long-range neuronal projections: circuit blueprint or stochastic targeting?

"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10269928,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Logic ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Probability ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Lateral ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' appendage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' sensory integration ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' patch clamp ', ' Leg ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' neuroethology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' peanut butter ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036

"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' cognitive function ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' reward processing ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' social defeat ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,10225560,R01DA047869,"['Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Future ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rewards ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' virtual reality ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' dopamine system ', ' neural correlate ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,235907
"Resting State Connectivity in Primate Spinal Cord ABSTRACT / SUMMARY  This proposal aims to continue our research to identify and characterize resting state functional MRI signals within the grey matter of the spinal cord, and to validate the interpretation of resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) networks in the spine that appear to reflect specific, behaviorally-relevant functions. In the current funding period we have found resting state networks within the cord exhibit more complex connectivity than previously reported, both within and across segments, including significant correlations with the intermediate region and grey commissure that are relevant for autonomic functions and left-right coordination. Importantly, by implementing a dorsal column injury to the cervical spine in a non-human primate, we have confirmed that the strengths of connectivity within these networks are in general related to functional performance, and changes in the networks correspond to behavioral changes in, for example, skilled hand use. We next aim to fully characterize the sub-components of rsFC and relate them to more specific functions. We will acquire sub-millimeter, multi-parametric MR images at high field (9.4T) in squirrel monkeys and address three main aims. (1) We will identify and differentiate rsFC networks within spinal cord using selective lesions and pharmacological interventions to determine which components and network connectivities are affected by specific disruptions of normal sensory or motor pathways. We will isolate circuits affected by (a) reversible block of motor or sensory inputs with pharmacological agents; (b) permanently ablating the drive of motor neurons from primary motor cortex in ventral horn; and (c) disrupting sensory signals to dorsal horn neurons by sectioning dorsal spinal nerve roots. We will follow the evolution of each injury using CEST and DTI to measure the extent and severity of the injury, and DTI and qMT to validate injury severity and quantify changes in axonal integrity and myelination. (2) We will validate the rsFC measures from MRI by comparisons with electrophysiology, micro-stimulation and tract-tracing histology. We will (a) directly stimulate specific nodes while monitoring down-stream activity with electrophysiology and fMRI; (b) perform longitudinal fMRI and microarray recordings of electrical coherences in each monkey subjected to specific interventions (Aim 1); and (c) determine whether regions which appear to be functionally connected by fMRI also show strong anatomical connections by injecting tracers and performing histological assessments post mortem. (3) We will determine the functional and behavioral relevance of rsFC by disrupting each circuit, identifying corresponding changes in rsFC, and relating these changes to performance of skilled hand sensorimotor behavior. By the completion of the study, we will validate rsFC measurements as indicators of spinal cord functions, and establish the fine- grained intrinsic architecture of intra-spinal circuits. These studies will provide new information on the neural organization of the spinal cord, validate the interpretation of BOLD measurements of connectivity, and provide a roadmap for the use of fMRI for studying human spinal cord functions. Narrative The studies proposed will identify and differentiate neural networks within the grey matter of the spinal cord that subserve different functions and which may be detected using functional MRI. The patterns of connections between different sub-regions of the cord will be quantified before and after targeted interventions that are intended to disrupt specific functions.

"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', ' Acetylation ', ' Acyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acyl CoA ', ' Fatty Acyl CoA ', ' Long-Chain Acyl CoA ', ' Acylation ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Coenzyme A ', ' CoA ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Histones ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleases ', ' RNA Nucleases ', ' RNase ', ' Ribonuclease Family Protein ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Nuclear RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' histone modification ', ' Histone Acetylation ', ' Defect ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Seminal ', ' Translational Regulation ', ' Translational Repression ', ' Translational Inhibition ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' frontier ', ' Translational Derepression ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' memory consolidation ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis.

MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses. The center will also develop new mass spectrometry methods, molecular biology methods, and informatics models to create a platform technology for sub-cellular genomics. Many human diseases, especially neuropsychiatric diseases, can be traced to dysfunction of organelles and other sub-cellular components.

"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system – based on dopamine – that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these ‘prediction error’ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level ‘task states’ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to ‘decode’ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,10153745,R01DA050647,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Odors ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' synergism ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Impulsivity ', ' theories ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' reward circuitry ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' dopamine system ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' neural correlate ', ' brain circuitry ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,283500
"Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals Abstract Groundbreaking work within the NIH BRAIN Initiative has revealed many new types of neurons and their genetic signatures. The dividends from this research will include sophisticated tools allowing selective genetic access to these cell-types, such as for imaging, optogenetic or tracing studies. To complement these powerful genetic tools, it will be equally important to have new imaging techniques that can reveal how multiple neuron- types work together in the live brain to support information-processing and construct different brain states.  To address this challenge, Stanford University and The John B. Pierce Laboratory at Yale University will create optical techniques for imaging the concurrent voltage dynamics of up to 4 separate neuron-types in behaving animals. First, we will combine machine learning methods and an automated, high-throughput protein screening platform to engineer 4 different categories of genetically encoded fluorescent optical indicators of neuronal transmembrane voltage. We will then innovate several types of optical instruments tailored to work in conjunction with the new voltage indicators. These instruments will enable unprecedented studies of voltage rhythms and spiking dynamics in 2–4 genetically identified neuron-types in superficial and deep brain areas of awake behaving animals. One instrument will allow us to track the concurrent, population voltage oscillations of 2 neuron-types in freely behaving rodents. Another instrument, an optical mesoscope, will enable imaging studies of voltage waves and oscillations across the entire neocortical surface of behaving mice. A third device will be a high-speed miniature microscope for tracking neural dynamics at single cell-, single spike-resolution in freely behaving mice. Lastly, we will develop the capability to image with millisecond-scale precision the simultaneous spiking dynamics of 4 targeted neuron-types in either cortical or deep brain areas. Five external beta-tester labs will evaluate all these innovations in live mice and flies and provide critical user-feedback.  If our work succeeds, it will be a ‘game-changer’ for studies of brain dynamics, yielding vital knowledge about how different neuron-types synergize their dynamics to shape animal behavior and the brain’s global states in health and disease. To facilitate this outcome, we plan a 5-fold strategy for resource sharing: (i) All voltage-indicator constructs, viral vectors, transgenic flies, software and screening data will be deposited at public repositories for open distribution; (ii) All instrument designs will be published in extensive detail to facilitate replication; (iii) Our novel imaging devices will be integrated into an existing NIH-supported, publicly accessible facility for brain-imaging in rodents; (iv) In project years 2–4, we will conduct 4 training workshops for 40 visiting scientists per year (120 in total) to learn the new technologies firsthand. These visitors will also provide extensive user-feedback; (v) We will license our imaging instruments for commercial distribution.  Overall, we expect our project will lead to major conceptual advances in brain science and multiple new technologies that will reshape the practice of mammalian brain imaging. Project Narrative Prominent successes of the NIH BRAIN Initiative to date include the identification of many new types of neurons, but to understand how these cell-types work together in the live brain it will be crucial to have techniques that can record the coordinated voltage dynamics of multiple classes of identified neurons simultaneously. To create such techniques, we will engineer four novel fluorescent indicators of neuronal trans-membrane voltage and three new optical instruments tailored to use these indicators to image either the spiking or oscillatory voltage dynamics of up to four neuron-types concurrently in the brains of awake behaving animals. These innovations will reveal how multiple neuron-types act concertedly at the millisecond-scale to support information-processing and shape a wide range of neurophysiologic states.",Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals,10166236,U01NS120822,"['Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Licensing ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' mutant ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' FRET ', ' Förster Resonance Energy Transfer ', ' Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ', ' voltage ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' brain shape ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Optical Instrument ', ' Optics/Optical Instrument ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' neocortical ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' imaging study ', ' microendoscopy ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' imaging facilities ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' absorption ', ' Action Potentials ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Animals ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Fiber Optics ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Dorsal ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,875437
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicosity ', ' Varices ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' petabyte ', ' Infrastructure ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,10432328,R00MH120343,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Sleep ', ' Spatial Behavior ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cell assembly ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' memory consolidation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,248680
"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crowding ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Ferrets ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pupil ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Auditory system ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neural model ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' auditory processing ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591
"Neural circuits for action perception: An integrative approach Project summary Social interactions – a ubiquitous and essential aspect of our everyday life – rely on the correct perception of the actions of others. Experimental evidence suggests that the ability to interpret others’ actions is subserved by a network of areas of which motor cortex represents an important hub. The precise role of this motor hub in action perception is still largely unknown. In this proposal, we will assess the mechanisms underlying action perception through invasive recordings of intracranial field potential signals in humans and computational analyses methods. This approach will allow us to study the role of motor processes in action perception with high spatiotemporal accuracy. Project narrative The correct perception of the actions of others is the cornerstone of our social interactions. The neural substrates of this fundamental skill are still poorly understood. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying action perception will have important implications for mental health disorders characterized by dysfunctional social interactions such as autism. Furthermore, given the present trend toward interactions with embodied artificial agents, biological insights about action perception will also inform the design of future human-robot interaction paradigms.

"Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement across the opioid exposure cycle PROJECT SUMMARY Pathological adaptions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system associated with chronic exposure to opioids and opioid withdrawal can dysregulate responsivity to opioids and contextual cue associations. The primary goal of this training proposal is to gain new skills in advanced computational techniques to delineate how functionally diverse subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons are regulated during morphine exposure and the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. Foundational findings have identified the intrinsic and synaptic (glutamatergic and GABAergic) adaptations that VTA dopamine neurons undergo throughout acute and chronic opioid exposure. Yet, few studies have accounted for the functional diversity of VTA dopamine neurons that mediate distinct aspects of cue-reward processing and motivation. Dissociating the potential diversity of VTA dopamine responses in the development of opioid dependence will help unravel the neural basis of the progression of opioid-use disorder. The Zweifel lab has previously used a genetic approach to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons that project to discrete regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons were found to selectively project to the NAc Core (VTACore) and cholecystokinin (Cck)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons selectively project to the NAc medial Shell (VTAmShell). I hypothesize that there exist projection-specific neural and behavioral correlates in response to morphine and during the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. I will investigate this using a systematic approach across three aims. For Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral pharmacology and fiber photometry to determine whether VTACore and VTAmShell dopamine neurons engage in uniform or differential dose-dependent neural activation dynamics in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 2 (K99), I will use my skills in conditioned place preference and in vivo fiber photometry to determine how the VTACore and VTAmShell neurons encode contextual associations to morphine in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 3 (R00), I will determine the basis of these pathological adaptations in VTA dopamine subpopulations by dissecting the role mu-opioid receptor (MOR)- sensitive GABAergic inputs play in morphine contextual associations. During the K99 mentored phase, I will gain new scientific training in Dr. Larry Zweifel’s laboratory, augmented by my advisory committee, in computational analytical tools to analyze complex neurophysiological and behavioral data sets. I will also gain new career development training from Dr. Zweifel, my advisory committee, and the MOSAIC UE5 program that will facilitate my transition into a successful independent principal investigator in academia. Importantly, I will continue my work on increasing representation and equity in the biomedical research workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid crisis has inflicted a tremendous socioeconomic burden and resulted in the countless loss of lives. In order to further initiatives geared towards resolving the opioid crisis with novel treatments, basic neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie pathological opioid behaviors need to be elucidated.

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,10199070,U19NS107466,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dedications ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Exploratory Behavior ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Histology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reticular Formation ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Tongue ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' neuron component ', ' physical model ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Motor ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' active control ', ' Output ', ' orofacial ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' platform-independent ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' sensory input ', ' control theory ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2021,2989579
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human Activities ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Societies ', ' Task Performances ', ' Technology ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase ', ' CRE Recombinase ', ' bacteriophage P1 recombinase Cre ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Walking ', ' Custom ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Medial Dorsal Nucleus ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus of the Thalamus ', ' Dorsomedial Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Supermarket ', ' empowered ', ' calcium indicator ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' memory encoding ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' sensory input ', ' self-directed learning ', ' independent learning ', ' self-regulated learning ', ' microendoscope ', ' endomicrosope ', ' Injections ', ' Grain ', ' social relationships ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036
"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology

"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,10150484,R01MH120404,"['Morphologic Finding ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphological signature ', ' Physical shape ', ' Property ', ' Brain region ', ' ward ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Homolog ', ' Homologue ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Behavioral ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' transcriptomics ', ' neocortical ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Injections ', ' preservation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' patch sequencing ', ' patch-seq ', ' patchseq ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Guns ', ' gun ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Perception ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,401250
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,10069403,R01NS088567,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pontine structure ', ' Pons ', ' Pons Cerebelli ', ' Pons Varolii ', ' Pontine ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Forebrain ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,379571

"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,10162319,F32MH123015,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Posture ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Space Models ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Event ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' gaze ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Structure ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Retrieval ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' way finding ', ' spatial navigation ', ' wayfinding ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' memory consolidation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,71390
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes. This work forms a basis to study central alterations following noise- induced hearing loss or other cochlear pathology, and gain deeper understanding of all auditory structures from brainstem to cortex.",The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus,10131580,R01DC015901,"['Acoustic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' auditory nerve ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Axon ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Noise-Induced Hearing Loss ', ' noise related hearing loss ', ' noise-induced hearing impairment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Octopus ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Work ', ' recombinase ', ' Cochlear nucleus ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Peripheral ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' sensory nerve ', ' afferent nerve ', ' Auditory system ', ' granule cell ', ' parallel processing ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' central nervous system processing ', ' CNS processing ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' sensory system ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Skeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' molecular scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' neural model ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' biophysical model ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' auditory processing ', ' human error ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' health goals ', ' in silico ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2021,620597
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking.

"Neural dynamics and substrates of graphical knowledge Project Summary/Abstract The ability to use explicitly structured internal models of the world is both central to biological intelligence and impaired in disorders of cognition (e.g. dementia and schizophrenia). Recent work indicates that cognitive abilities such as declarative memory and navigation rely on internal models having the structure of graphs, i.e. composed of rules and variables. Such graphical knowledge structures, or ‘schemas,’ are now thought to be what enable humans and animals alike to make extraordinary and systematic inferences, to generalize, to learn in single trials, and to imagine: thus schemas are understood to be basis of advanced cognition. Still, despite this vital importance, little is known about how neurons in the brain implement schemas. Solving this overarching problem is my scientific goal, and the aim of the present proposal. In recent work, I have discovered a collection of recurrent neural networks (RNN) – neural systems that are plausibly implemented in the brain – that can perform three cognitive tasks requiring schemas: transitive inference (TI), associative inference (AI), and identity rule inference (IRI). Importantly, these tasks are potentially more tractable alternatives to traditional schematic tasks in neuroscience: indeed, initial analyses indicate that RNNs use a solvable set of dynamical mechanisms to implement schemas, and are thus mechanistic hypotheses that have not previously existed in neuroscience. Given these findings, I hypothesize that these candidate mechanisms are used in hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), two brain regions required for schemas. To test this guiding hypothesis, I will solve and characterize the mechanisms accomplishing AI and TI (Aim 1) and IRI (Aim 2) in RNNs (K99), then probe mechanisms experimentally via high-density recordings in the HPC and PFC of rats performing these tasks in an innovative olfactory-based paradigm (Aim 3) (R00). Achieving these Aims has the potential to establish how schemas are implemented in the brain, and therefore can clarify the neural basis of advanced cognition; this work can also clarify computational and behavioral roles of HPC and PFC, two brain structures essential to cognition. The K99 phase of this work will be done in the Zuckerman Institute for Brain and Behavior at Columbia University under the mentorship of Larry Abbott and John Cunningham, two leading authorities who will advise on neural modelling, dynamical systems, and advanced machine learning; in addition, collaborators (Drs. Stefano Fusi, Vincent Ferrera, Daphna Shohamy, Rui Costa, and Richard Axel) will contribute scientific and technical expertise on cognitive tasks (design and neurobiological interpretation) and neural recordings. The training environment also includes the wider innovative and collaborative neuroscience community at Columbia, the Columbia Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and their associated scientific and career development opportunities. Training in the K99 phase will be crucial for both the proposed research and for establishing future scientific and professional independence as an investigator leading a research group. Project Narrative Our cognitive abilities define us, and disorders involving cognitive impairment (including dementia, schizophrenia, and autism) are both debilitating and widespread. Recent scientific advances indicate that many of our most vital cognitive abilities (including memory, reasoning, planning, and creativity) rely on a form of knowledge that has the structure of graphs – yet despite this insight, we still do not know how graphical knowledge is implemented by neurons in the brain. This proposal aims to solve this problem by combining two powerful complementary approaches: (i) neural network models and (ii) experimental analysis of neural activity in animals (rats) that have acquired graphical knowledge.",Neural dynamics and substrates of graphical knowledge,10371663,K99MH126158,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Pathologic ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' experimental analysis ', ' brain behavior ', ' way finding ', ' spatial navigation ', ' wayfinding ', ' mathematical theory ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' math theory ', ' mathematic theory ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics theory ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' Algebra ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,125442
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations.

"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,10388902,F32MH123012,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cloning ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gait ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Walking ', ' Label ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Neuropil ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Leg ', ' ARNT ', ' Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator ', ' Dioxin Receptor, Nuclear Translocator ', ' HIF-1 Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1beta ', ' HIF1-Beta Gene ', ' HIF1B ', ' HIF1B Gene ', ' HIF1Beta ', ' HIF1beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, Beta subunit ', ' Nuclear Translocator Gene Dioxin Receptor ', ' TANGO ', ' ARNT gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Motor output ', ' motor control ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,2500
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory-experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work, and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,10296960,R00NS114194,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' limb movement ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' neural model ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' mathematical analysis ', ' math analysis ', ' mathematics analysis ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R00,2021,249000
"Astrocyte Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior Project Summary: Overall “What is the function of glial cells in neural centers? The answer is still not known, and it may remain unsolved for many years to come until scientists find direct methods to attack it.” (Ramon y Cajal, 1901). This prophecy turned out to be accurate. Astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types in the brain, have long been thought of as primarily passive support cells. Over the past two decades, studies indicate that astrocytes play pivotal roles in nervous system development, function, and diseases. However, a major unresolved issue in neuroscience is how astrocytes integrate diverse neuronal signals under healthy conditions, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and how aberrant excitation and molecular output influences sensorimotor behavior and contributes to disease. The overall goal of this U19 Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Program proposal is to address this fundamental issue by developing a deeper mechanistic understanding of astrocytes’ roles in neural circuit operation, complex behaviors, and brain computation theories. Two overarching questions will be addressed: 1) How do astrocytes temporally and spatially integrate molecular signals from the diverse types of local and projection neurons activated during sensorimotor behaviors. 2) How do astrocytes convert this information into functional outputs that modulate neural circuit structure and function at different spatial and temporal scales. A multidisciplinary, comprehensive effort is proposed to address these questions that can only be completed through close collaboration between researchers with unique and complementary expertise. An innovative multi-scale approach integrating functional, anatomical, and genetic analyses with theoretical modeling will be leveraged. This approach involves quantitative behavioral assays, large-scale imaging of cellular and molecular dynamics, targeted cell-type-specific manipulations, high- throughput omic techniques, genetic profiling, protein engineering, machine learning, and computational modeling. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms will be determined through which astrocytes influence neural circuits and contribute to complex behaviors and brain computation theories. The experimental and data analysis tools developed as part of this project will be invaluable for the broader neuroscience community. Project Narrative: Overall The human brain contains roughly equal numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. A major unresolved issue in understanding brain function is how the non-neuronal cells integrate neuronal molecular signals, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and mediate changes in information processing, perception, and behavior.

"State-dependent Decision-making in Brainwide Neural Circuits Summary/Abstract Animals constantly make decisions, such as how to evaluate a potential threat or where to look for food. Yet the same animal in the same environment can produce different decisions on different occasions, because its internal state interacts powerfully with external inputs to determine behavior. This proposal’s overarching goal is to understand how internal states influence decisions and to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. In a mouse decision-making task, these experiments will examine the effects of three types of internal state changes: those arising spontaneously with engagement and disengagement in a task, those resulting from changing expectations during the task, and those resulting from learning within and across days. To determine how internal states affect brain activity and behavior, the team will apply cutting-edge technical advances on a brainwide scale, including statistical tools to infer internal states from behavior; simultaneous recordings from large populations of neurons across many regions during behavior and during optogenetic perturbations; assays that map functionally and molecularly defined cell-type-specific, cross-region connectivity; and computational approaches to model how cross-region neural communication depends on internal states. These ambitious goals go beyond the capabilities of an individual laboratory and are ideally suited for an already- productive consortium. This team is part of the International Brain Laboratory, which has already developed a standardized mouse decision-making task and standardized methods for training, neural measurement, and data analysis, along with a working, scalable infrastructure for sharing data. The proposed research leverages this existing infrastructure and takes it in a new direction. Projects 1-5 will examine simultaneously recorded population activity, evaluate causality, study neural activity and behavior during learning in normal and autism model mice, identify cell types by measuring neuronal activity, gene expression, and axonal projection patterns in the same populations of neurons, and build a comprehensive computational model of all these experimental results. Cores A-D will support the collection, replicability, management, and analysis of the large datasets produced by this brainwide examination of neural circuits. Taken together, the proposed research will rigorously define the neural basis of multiple internal states and evaluate their impact on the flow of decision-relevant information through the brain. The results will greatly advance the field by generating a comprehensive, mechanistic understanding of how internal states are reflected in the brain, and how these states interact with external inputs to guide decisions. Moreover, the team will produce and disseminate open-source tools and protocols that will enable other laboratories to collect and manage large-scale datasets produced through brainwide measurements. Project Narrative This ambitious experimental and theoretical collaboration will investigate how internal states (such as task engagement) influence decision-making, and identify the underlying neural mechanisms. The proposed work will produce an integrated, circuit-level model that explains decision behavior and neural activity in healthy and autism model mice, which show a reduced ability to make decisions that take changing expectations into account. Decision-making is also impaired in addiction and schizophrenia, so a deeper understanding of brainwide decision-making circuitry may contribute to future research on ways to treat or mitigate these disorders.",State-dependent Decision-making in Brainwide Neural Circuits,10294668,U19NS123716,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' data infrastructure ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,U19,2021,3795695
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials ', ' Animal Feed ', ' animal food ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Biogenic Amines ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Cues ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Physiology ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Sleep ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neurotransmitter release ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Stretching ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Global Change ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' food environment ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' connectome ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' squid axon ', ' squid axoplasm ', ' squid giant axon ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,455727
"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the biological principles of neuronal cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function and disorders.

"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Ganglia ', ' Neural Ganglion ', ' Goals ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' New York ', ' Optic Lobe ', ' Corpora Bigemina ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Retina ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Comprehension ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Neuropil ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Medical center ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neuroblast ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stem cell based therapy ', ' stem cell mediated therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' neuroepithelium ', ' Neural Stem Cell ', ' neural precursor ', ' neural precursor cell ', ' neural progenitor ', ' neural progenitor cells ', ' neuron progenitors ', ' neuronal progenitor ', ' neuronal progenitor cells ', ' neuronal stem cells ', ' neuroprogenitor ', ' nerve stem cell ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' stem cell renewal ', ' stem cell division ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Inhibition of Apoptosis ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Mutate ', ' Cell Death Inhibition ', ' Neuroepithelial ', ' Transcript ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' progenitor ', ' retinotopic ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning.

"Comprehensive and multi-resolution mapping of cell morphology and wiring through X-ray holographic nano-tomography Project Summary / Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is understanding how information is processed in neuronal circuits. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is dependent on how it is connected, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How do we approach such a complex computational system? Recent advances in X-ray microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and connectivity. The cerebellum is an excellent system to scale and validate a new platform to systematically reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently studied to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and their connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to scale and validate our next-generation X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently established in our labs to disentangle a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit and cell type organization, and may help us determine the role of specific cell types in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles of cell types in the cerebellum. We will develop and scale X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) to extract the anatomy and connectivity of cerebellar cell types.

"Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement Abstract The ~86 billion neurons that form the human brain are organized at multiple scales, ranging from the fine details of an individual neuron’s dendritic arborization, to local circuits that are embedded within large-scale systems spanning the brain. In this project, we will image across this vast range of scales to create a multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brain that can visualize hemisphere-wide networks and then zoom in to see individual, labeled cells at micron resolution in the frontal temporal lobe. This dramatic advance will be made possible through the use of an array of imaging technologies, including light-sheet microscopy (LSM), tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry (IMH), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and newly developed techniques in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as it provides micron resolution over large volumes of tissue, images all of the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and staining and hence can be automated, and is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior to cutting. LSM-based IMH will provide molecular, morphological and spatial properties of cells that will enable us to develop cellular classification systems, while OCT images of the same tissue will enable us to remove the distortions induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer information to whole-hemisphere MRI for atlasing and in vivo inference. This transfer of information depends critically on the ability to register images across a huge range of resolutions and contrast types. For this we propose to use the endogenous fiducial landmarks provided by the cerebral vasculature. To take full advantage of the vasculature using deep learning requires a training set of labeled vessels in each of our imaging modalities across an array of examples. The goal of this supplement is to provide these labelings including the assessment of intra- and inter-rater reliability. Relevance Automated segmentation of neurons, glia, cortical areas and laminar boundaries will enable new and more specific types of analyses of neuroimaging data. In particular, the ability to probe cellular and laminar properties of specific cortical areas may provide significant advances in developmental disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia. To facilitate these advances we propose to label cerebral vessels, then use the manual labeling to develop a deep learning-based technique to register images from microscopy to whole-hemisphere MRI.",Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement,10307352,U01MH117023,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Microscopy ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Cerebrovascular system ', ' brain blood vessels ', ' brain vasculature ', ' cerebral blood vessel ', ' cerebral vasculature ', ' cerebrovascular vessels ', ' cerebrovasculature ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Morphology ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Property ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,99916
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' Retina ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Penetrance ', ' visual processing ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Column of Bertini ', ' Renal Column of Bertini ', ' Cortical Column ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patch clamp ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' area V1 ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' connectome ', ' MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome ', ' methyl CpG-binding protein 2 duplication syndrome ', ' deep learning ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10415740,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' Punishment ', ' Conditioned Reflex ', ' conditioned response ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Mediating ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Bilateral ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' fitness ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Aversive Stimulus ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' motivated behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' loss of function ', ' optogenetics ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' ']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,41175
"From diverse dynamics to diverse computation via neural cell types Project Summary A prominent feature of biological neuronal networks is the astonishing diversity of their cell types. Major, nationally coordinated experimental efforts, including the BRAIN Initiative’s Cell Census Network (BICCN) and the Allen Institute Cell Types programs, are currently revealing this cellular diversity at new and very high levels of resolution. For example, just across two areas of mouse cortex 133 cell types have been characterized, with many types shared across areas! Similar cell classes have been observed across species. These types show marked differences not only gene expression and connectivity, but also membrane, spiking, and synaptic dynamics. This is in sharp contrast to most computational and theoretical models of learning in neural networks, which generally make use of only one or a small number of cell types. The goal of this project is to produce new computational and theoretical tools to help close this gap. This will enable us, and the broader community, to test a hypothesis for the functional role of cell-type specific, heterogeneous cellular and synaptic dynamics: that they can be harnessed to generate complex network dynamics which allows faster or more accurate learning of tasks which themselves have inputs or objectives which have complex dynamics. Such tasks abound in natural environments. Testing this hypothesis requires new high-throughput computational tools to train neural networks with biologically realistic dynamics and connectivity to solve tasks, new theoretical tools to understand how diverse cellular dynamics contribute to network computation, and new application to large-scale, cellular data-driven models. First, with the expertise of a grant-supported scientific software engineer, will build, test, and disseminate a software package that flexibly implements heterogeneous dynamics of single cells and short-term synaptic dynamics. We plan to use a very popular, freely available and open source software framework for machine learning (Pytorch). Next, we will establish metrics of network dynamics that help to mechanistically explain what does -- and does not -- matter about cellular and synaptic heterogeneity in impacting learning performance. Finally, we will integrate these tools with a prior cell-type specific computational model of the mouse primary visual cortex, based on large scale Allen Institute databases, to test the hypothesis stated above. Specifically, we will newly determine whether experimentally observed levels of heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic dynamics contribute to the ability of visual microcircuits to perform visual computation. Project Narrative The brain is composed of a large number of cell types, each with diverse dynamical properties that vary robustly from type to type. We propose to study the role of this diversity in how circuits in the brain compute, by building new tools that will enable the community to simulate and analyze learning in neural networks with complex cellular components.",From diverse dynamics to diverse computation via neural cell types,10263658,RF1DA055669,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Weight ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' large-scale database ', ' large-scale data base ', ' open source ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' Software Framework ', ' neural network ', ' computational basis ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDA,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1115283
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10201770,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,353797
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression).

"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors.

"Combined Mechanistic and Input-Output Modeling of the Hippocampus During Spatial Navigation PROJECT ABSTRACT Large-scale realistic model of neuronal network is a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics and cognitive functions. It integrates multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms/processes identified through diverse hypotheses and experimental data into a single platform. However, due to its high complexity and lack of neuron-to-neuron correspondence to experimental data, it is difficult to constrain, validate and optimize such a model using large- scale neural activities recorded from behaving animals, which are most relevant to cognitive processes. We propose to develop a novel modeling paradigm inspired by the generative adversarial network (GAN) to synergistically combine both mechanistic and input-output (machine learning) modeling techniques to build large- scale realistic models that are functionally indistinguishable from actual neuronal networks. We will apply this paradigm to the modeling of the hippocampus to reveal how spatial information is encoded and re-encoded in the hippocampal neuronal networks during navigation. Specifically, full-scale mechanistic model of the hippocampus will be constructed as the generative model to simulate how hippocampal circuits generate ensemble spiking activities in response to 2D trajectories during navigation. Large-scale population-level input- output models will be developed to statistically characterize input-output properties of the real hippocampus and the hippocampal mechanistic model. The input-output models of the mechanistic model will be evaluated by a discriminator against the ground truth input-output models of the real hippocampus. This forms the discriminative model that (1) identifies discrepancies between the mechanistic model and the real hippocampus, and (2) guides the optimization/modification of neuron model and connectivity parameters of the generative model. This procedure will be performed iteratively until the discriminator fails to distinguish the generative (mechanistic) model from the real hippocampus. In addition, the modifications to the mechanistic model generated by this paradigm will provide falsifiable predictions that can be further tested experimentally. We expect to use this combined mechanistic and input-output modeling strategy to unveil how (1) causal relations between spiking activities across different hippocampal subregions, and (2) place fields of hippocampal neurons, are determined by multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms and the interplay between these mechanisms. The proposed methodology will provide a general computational framework for integrating biological knowledge, hypotheses, and large-scale input-output data to gain deeper and more quantitative understanding of cognitive functions.

"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants.

The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain

"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies. The aim of this proposal is to seek out and establish new mechanisms underlying reactive and appetitive aggression, possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets with higher efficacy and decreased off-target effects.",Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression,10150355,F31MH125587,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Breeding ', ' Calcium ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Photometry ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Time ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' increased appetite ', ' Appetite stimulated ', ' Increased food appetite ', ' increased hunger ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' restraint ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' reward circuitry ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' neuroethology ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' Injections ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2021,43944
"Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings Project Summary Opioid overdoses kill more than 130 Americans every day, yielding over 47,500 deaths per year, and the same number of deaths in the 9/11 attacks every 23 days. The best treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are medication-assisted therapies such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, and are inadequate to buttress the epidemic. Failure to treat OUD is sourced in not understanding the molecular pathophysiology of OUD, including its clinical manifestations as a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, the neurobiological mechanisms that reinforce its consumption, and how repeated consumption affects other neurocognitive processes. The Hurd lab recently discovered a genomic locus associated with OUD, downstream of the protein tyrosine-kinase FYN, in striatal neurons from human heroin abusers. Additionally, heroin increased Fyn expression in the striatum of rats that undergo heroin self-administration (SA), and in primary striatal neuronal cultures. FYN phosphorylates tau, and hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to precede neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of neurocognitive disease. This proposal leverages high-throughput electronic medical records (EMR) from the Mount Sinai Health System to examine how chronic opioid exposure affects the odds of neurocognitive disease (NCD) on a population level, and EMR from two other hospitals at Columbia University and the University of San Francisco to replicate these effects, using the same analysis pipeline. Additionally, I propose mechanistic studies of Fyn overexpression in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region known to be affected in NCD and OUD, on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors using animal models. Further, I used a machine learning approach with RNA-seq data obtained from human post-mortem OFC tissue to classify subjects as either belonging to the heroin overdose or control group based on the expression of ~10 genes. Three feature (gene) importance metrics highlighted a transcript, SHISA7, that was reduced in the human OFC, and this finding was replicated in the OFC of rats that underwent heroin self-administration. SHISA7 and FYN both regulate the synaptic function of AMPA receptors, and are components of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic neurons. I will examine the impact of overexpressing SHISA7, identified using this machine learning approach, in the OFC on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors in animal models. Finally, I will conduct RNA-sequencing experiments on the OFC from Fyn- and Shisa7-manipulated animals, and in downstream bioinformatics analyses, parse key drivers of gene networks to identify potential mechanisms that account for the contribution of these genes to heroin SA and cognitive behaviors. High-throughput clinical and gene expression data from the human can inform translational, mechanistic studies using animal models that will enable a far-reaching understanding of the molecular disturbances underlying the effects of opioids on cognition and addiction. Project Narrative The opioid epidemic is killing over 130 Americans every day, and current treatments consist of opioid substitution therapies, which are fraught with challenges and ineffective at slowing the epidemic. Opioid use disorder is a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, and our scientific understanding of it must proceed along multiple dimensions of analysis to elucidate its underlying molecular pathophysiology, with the end goal of formulating novel treatments. This project will gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of how opioids affect cognition and addiction, starting from high-throughput human studies using advanced computational methods, proceeding to mechanistic studies using animal models of reversal learning and heroin self-administration behaviors, and further through deep sequencing and bioinformatics studies to characterize gene networks and key drivers impacted by opioid exposure.",Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings,10150982,F31DA051183,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ',

"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', ' Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Memory ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Polysomnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Eszopiclone ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' therapeutic target ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Genetic study ', ' memory consolidation ', ' brain circuitry ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' clinical candidate ', ' preservation ', ' sleep spindle ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Punishment ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' zebra finch ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' vocal learning ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' stem ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' ']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255
"Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with 88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules. Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador). In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40 CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression. We propose to achieve highly comprehensive characterization of the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in human brain tissues, and determine their emerging roles on enhancing neuronal uptake of vesicle associated tau and spread of tau pathology in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by specific antagonistic reagents for their therapeutic potential for halting tau propagation in vivo. These studies will lead to a better understanding of vesicle-mediated disease spread mechanism in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathy.",Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for

"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,10098347,R01MH121480,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Shorthand ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory recall ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' computer-based representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' knowledge representation ', ' information organization ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Social Security Number ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' microstimulation ', ' biological systems ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,460527
"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients.

"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' memory retrieval ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' virtual reality ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' memory encoding ', ' tool development ', ' phase 1 testing ', ' phase 1 evaluation ', ' phase I evaluation ', ' phase I testing ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036
"Optoretinography: All-optical measures of functional activity in the human retina Project Summary/Abstract The last few decades have seen major inroads into detailing the physiological mechanisms supporting vision as well as therapies aimed at rescue and repair of neurons affected by retinal diseases. For the continued evolution of treatments and their rapid translation to the clinic, it is essential to find a non-invasive, all-optical biomarker to monitor the efficacy of disease and potential therapeutic agents. To this end, we propose to develop the optoretinogram, or ORG, the optical analog to the electroretinogram (ERG) which is the current gold standard for retinal function assessment in humans. The ORG is rooted in classical interferometry and enables a highly sensitive assay of how neurons interact with light. Using this technique, our group has demonstrated the ability to visualize light-driven neural activity across a range of spatiotemporal resolution – from single cells to a collection of neurons, and from µsecs to ms timescales. Here, we aim to expand the capabilities of the ORG and demonstrate its efficacy for basic science and clinical applications. The proposed technology is built upon a solid foundation of established approaches, and combines them in new and complementary ways to achieve an optimal combination of speed, resolution and sensitivity geared towards overcoming the key challenges faced with imaging cellular structure-function in humans. The core technologies are phase-resolved OCT, an eye-safe, interferometric method to measure nm-scale changes at ms time scales in vivo, adaptive optics (AO) to overcome ocular aberrations, increase the signal-to-noise and allow resolution down to single cells and real-time eye tracking to overcome eye motion and allow targeting, recording and averaging of responses from single and a collection of retinal neurons. These are implemented across three ORG platforms. At the University of Washington, we will refine the line-scan phase-resolved OCT with improvements in optical design and eye-tracking and use it to characterize the basic properties of phototransduction and inner retinal function in healthy human volunteers and patients with retinal degenerations. At Stanford University, we will develop a similar line-scan system for rodents, and together with transgenic models and pharmacology, determine the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the ORG and develop templates for human recordings. At UC Berkeley, we will push the envelope of speed and sensitivity by incorporating a real-time eye-tracking system to drive an AO-OCT interferometric probe, with the aim to measure the tiniest and briefest neuronal changes in the human retina. This bioengineering research partnership will benefit from complementary expertise, research direction and ORG implementation across the three sites, and the use of common approaches for image/data analysis, eye tracking and visual stimulation. Ultimately, the aggregate technology will facilitate a deeper mechanistic understanding of early visual processing and eye disease, and provide entirely new avenues for accelerating therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative This proposal outlines a plan to develop the technology for measuring the Optoretinogram, or ORG: the all- optical recording of functional activity of retinal neurons and their connections in a living eye. We employ a unique combination of technologies (OCT, adaptive optics, interferometry, eye-tracking) that together enable in vivo access to the early visual processing elements in the retina in humans. In the end, we envision powerful, clinically deployable tools suited to test and accelerate the new generation of treatments aimed at regenerating neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10448827,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79977
"Model organism neural circuit knowledge graph Project Summary To extract greater value from extensive but disparate and siloed data relevant to neural circuits, we will leverage the ontologies, bioinformatics, and curation of the Alliance of Genome Resources to derive an artificial intelligence (AI) ready knowledge graph. Participation of a computational neuroscientist who uses AI for neural circuit analyses will help specify the form of the knowledge graph, demonstrate the utility of the graphs, extend the graphs from a focus on the well-defined nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans to the similarly well- defined mouse retina, and connect with neuroscience researchers who are starting to applying AI to neural circuits. Known entities (such as neurons, small molecules, and neuropeptides) and Ontologies (anatomy, relations, and experimental evidence) provide the underlying data of the graph. Curated assertions provide the knowledge, e.g., synaptic or functional connections between neurons, neuropeptide has a specific receptor, or a neuropeptide is expressed in a specific neuron). In this graph model, entities are the nodes, ontological relationships are the edges. These provide an inferred knowledge graph supported by evidence backed assertions. This type of knowledge graph can be applied to biological pathways that are based on phenotype observations including expression, neuronal activity and organismal behavior rather than physical interactions or enzymatic activities such as those used to describe biochemical pathways. To accomplish generation of knowledge graphs, we will refine the relevant vocabularies to focus on relations used in neural circuit research, we will adjust existing infrastructure to handle the appropriate ontologies, data models, and curation tools for neural circuit data, and we will incentivize expert contributions by arranging short reviews coupled to computable assertions. The knowledge graph will be used by local AI experts, published on the internet, and tested by a hackathon. Project Narrative There are large amounts of high-quality data that are underutilized in our attempt to understand the structure and function of neural circuits. In particular the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches could be enabled by having these data in computable form and available via simple download or application programming interface (API). We will facilitate construction of knowledge graphs for neural circuits, construct graphs for the C. elegans nervous system and the mouse retina, and demonstrate utility by applying AI and ML to those graphs.",Model organism neural circuit knowledge graph,10412857,U24HG010859,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Incentives ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Neuropeptide Receptor ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' virtual ', ' Coupled ', ' prototype ', ' efficacy testing ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' connectome ', ' data access ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data curation ', ' WormBase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' genome resource ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",NHGRI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U24,2021,259479
"Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data Project Summary Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non- stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. Of particular interest is the description of interactions among two or more brain areas. This application is for an administrative supplement to support an under-represented minority PhD student for two years. As documented by, among others, the National Science Foundation, people of African ancestry are severely under-represented in the sciences. The training provided to the candidate, under this supplement, would serve to elevate the candidate's research profile, and would ultimately contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce. The candidate's research concerns methods for identifying the flow of information from one brain area to another based on neural spike trains. Two major complications are, first, the noisiness of spike trains as conveyors of information and, second, the large numbers of neurons that must be considered simultaneously. Statistical methods developed very recently, through research supported by this grant, suggest very promising approaches to reducing the effects of noise and grappling with large networks of neurons. Based on these ideas, the candidate will develop a PhD thesis topic, and pursue it, with support from this supplement. Description of R01 and Candidate's Project Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, new recording and stimulation technologies have the potential to greatly accelerate mental health research, thereby improving dramatically the treatments offered to patients. Still, although there have been many important advances in mental health research and treatment, in no case is any mental health disorder well understood mechanistically. Faced with the reality that each promising discovery inevitably reveals new subtleties, a reasonable experimental goal is to be able to change behavior in desirable ways by modifying speciﬁc brain circuits [5, 8] and, in animals, technologies exist for circuit disruptions that are precise in both space and time [4, 7]. However, determining the best location and time for such disruptions to occur, with minimal off-target effects, requires far greater knowledge of circuits than currently exist: we need good characterizations of interactions among brain areas, including their timing relative to behavior. The over- arching aim of our research is to provide statistical methods for describing the ﬂow of information, based on evolving neural activity, among multiple areas of the brain during behavioral tasks. Neurophysiologists are starting to apply methods that can lead to breakthroughs, but the resulting data are complicated, and carefully-crafted statistical methods are needed. The research conducted under this grant over the past 18 years has helped lay the foundation for major advances through steady, systematic investigation of variability in neural signals and construction of new techniques. Our approach applies the knowledge accumulated in the discipline of statistics to the special circumstances of neurophysiology. The primary way neurons communicate is through rapid electrical discharges known as spikes, and se- quences of spikes are known as spike trains. A major focus of attention is the rate at which a neuron is ﬁring, and the way that rate varies with experimental conditions and behaviors. We and others have been trying to understand better the ﬁring rate ﬂuctuations among spike trains recorded simultaneously from many neurons, across multiple regions of the brain. Because each spike occurs over the course of roughly 1 mil- lisecond while behavior occurs over hundreds of milliseconds, it is reasonable to consider a spike train to be a stochastic sequence of isolated points in time which, in probability and statistics, is called a point process. Early theoretical research on point processes relied on an assumption of steady-state time-invariance, known as stationarity. Every behavioral setting, however, creates constantly-evolving neural activity. The origin of this grant in 2001 was our outline of a simple and tractable approach to neural spike train analysis that accommodates evolving, non-stationary activity. It has become a standard tool, and much of our research is based on similar point process statistical models except now, to describe complicated settings, they are much more elaborate. We also analyze and study local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), which result from all the neural currents gener- ated near the electrode (roughly within 150-200 microns), involving large numbers of neurons [3, 6]. The response of an LFP to varying conditions is less discriminative than individual neurons, but its power (vari- ability) can reveal situations in which a neural population is active, and it has been shown to correlate substantially with the BOLD fMRI signal [11, 12]. LFPs are especially useful for studying the role of oscillating neural circuits. Oscillations appear during many cognitive tasks, and changes in power and os- cillatory coupling have been associated with cognitive impairment [2, 10, 14]. Some of our research has been investigating the sources of LFPs in the cerebral cortex which, using biophysically-informed models, can be inferred to originate in particular cortical layers, thereby supplying important additional detail about dynamics and function [1, 9, 13]. Our Speciﬁc Aim 1 concerns (a) a new, putatively more accurate method of attributing LFPs to cortical sources, which allows us to explore cross-area interactions in greater detail than previously possible, (b) 1 simultaneous analysis of large numbers of LFPs, including those coming from two or more brain areas, and (c) identiﬁcation of oscillatory interactions from multiple brain areas. Speciﬁc Aim 2 concerns (a) simulta- neous analysis of large numbers of spiking neurons, (b) identiﬁcation of cross-correlation among brain areas based on large numbers of spiking neurons within each area, and (c) methods for analysis of precisely-timed synchronous (or nearly synchronous) spiking events, possibly in conjunction with oscillatory signals that are apparent in LFPs. Speciﬁc Aim 3 concerns (a) the combined assessment of interactions that occur at multiple timescales, (b) methods for relating large numbers of LFPs, which evolve across time, to behavior, and (c) creation of a simulation system based on realistic ground-truth models to test our methods. The candidate to be supported by the requested supplement, Tolani Olarinre, is now starting his third year in the joint Machine Learning and Statistics PhD program. We anticipate his ﬁnishing in 3 years, i.e., August 2024. Olarinre's research falls under our Speciﬁc Aim 2 (parts 2A and 2B), which concerns coordinated activity of spiking neurons across brain regions. When information appears to ﬂow from one brain region to another, the time lag may be short, under 10 milliseconds. One way to track ﬂow of information is to look for trial- to-trial variations, and see whether they tend to be consistent across regions. There are simple ways to try to do this, but it turns out they don't work: individual neural spike trains behave much like the simplest point processes, Poisson processes (they are different, but similar), with the consequence that the precise spike timing is unpredictable and, as a result, spike trains provide very noisy representations of evolving neural ﬁring rates. One important component of our research has been to devise methods for reducing the effects of this Poisson-like noise. For example, if two brain regions are coordinated, when activity in one region occurs earlier than average, activity in the other region should tend to occur earlier than average. Olarinre has been working with another graduate student and, based on their work, we have documented the failure of simple methods for identifying this kind of information ﬂow. On the other hand, sophisticated statistical methods succeed in ﬁnding it. We expect to submit a manuscript for publication within the next few months. A major complexity involves the large numbers of neurons recorded within a region, and the possible in- teractions they may have among themselves. A now-standard way to identify such interactions, based on point process statistical modeling, is to put into the model “coupling” terms to measure the inﬂuence of one neuron on another. A former student, Neil Spencer, who recently defended his PhD under Kass's super- vision, has developed very interesting computationally-efﬁcient methods for examining these interactions using network models. We have realized, however, that models with standard coupling terms suffer from the curse of Poisson-like noise. Thus, to be maximally effective they need to be modiﬁed. In outline we know what modiﬁcations to make, but devising a good algorithm and implementation will be challenging. This is a main part of the project Olarinre will next take up and, because novel method and implementation development of this kind requires a lot of time, it will most likely take him through 2022, so that during the Spring semester of 2023 he will be able to propose a thesis topic that includes network models and applies them to key problems. Spencer has acquired world-level expertise in cutting-edge Bayesian computation and he has agreed to collaborate with Olarinre by suggesting approaches, and modiﬁcations when the need arises, which will be very helpful. A letter from Dr. Spencer is provided with this application. In Olarinre's detailed work to date, he has found a wide diversity of neural responses within small regions of cortex. One of the problems he plans to investigate is the role of distinguishable subclasses of neurons. This would require, ﬁrst, methods of deﬁning these subclasses based on physiology (spiking patters), with consideration of anatomical location (cortical layer). Other key problems are to describe the role of thalamic 2 input, and the variability of network behavior across animals. The latter problem will require development of additional new, computationally-intensive methods. The methods Tolani develops should provide new insights into brain network activity. His thesis will likely include contributions to all of these problems, and will thereby yield far more speciﬁc descriptions than currently exist of the way neurons in a particular brain region interact in order to ”package” the information that gets communicated. Mentoring Experience of PI The PI, Kass, has extensive experience mentoring trainees. Within the Department of Statistics he served as graduate advisor before becoming Department Head, a position he held for 9 years. He was involved in a series of 4 NSF training grants (and was PI on 3), across 17 years, all of which had mentoring as a major component. In those capacities he created, supervised, and participated in both group and individual mentoring programs. Kass subsequently served for 3 years as Interim Head of the department-like structure now called the Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon (CMU), and was concurrently the interim CMU- side Co-Director of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is an umbrella organization run jointly by CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. In that role he supervised graduate training in the very large non-degree program (just under 150 students enrolled, steady-state), which supplements disciplinary PhD training as a certiﬁcated add-on. During Kass's time as Department Head in Statistics he visited Morehouse College in an attempt to ﬁnd ways Carnegie Mellon could be helpful in supplementing the training of students from HBCUs. Out of that came a very successful summer program in basic statistics for those students interested in public health. From 2001 to 2007 we trained 33 students from 19 institutions. Many have gone on to very successful careers including advanced degrees, and we would like to think they were served well by being able to analyze and interpret data with conﬁdence (one became President of the Eastern North America branch of the Biometric Society). Kass has also been PI of an NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research training grant in computational neuro- science, which is now commencing its 15th year. Our version of the NIH Blueprint training in computational neuroscience has had an important additional component, a 10-week summer program for undergraduates, typically rising seniors. The program is not aimed primarily at URMs, but we have tried to recruit them during a selective admissions process. Over the past 8 years we trained 18 URM students (just under 25% of the total). The training begins with 2 weeks of background lectures together with supervised computational labs, and this is followed by 8 weeks of research as a member of a faculty lab group. Our goal has been to give these students the kind of exciting and productive research experience that would encourage them to apply to graduate school in areas related to computational neuroscience, while also getting them better pre- pared to do so. The program has been run by a faculty member devoted to this project (for summer support); Kass has served not only as the PI of the program but also as an active participant, delivering lectures and supervising 1 or 2 undergraduate trainees himself each summer. Training and Career Development Plan Primary Mentoring Having gotten to know Olarinre over these past 2.5 years, Kass is aware of his unusual strengths and also the challenges he faces. Olarinre now has good training in graduate level statistics and machine learning. He also has an unusually strong background in software engineering (having worked at Intel for 5 years). There are, however, occasional holes in his background, and his progress is somewhat slower than many other students here (Carnegie Mellon attracts its share of the very top students in statistics and machine learning internationally). As a consequence, in addition to weekly group meetings that Kass 3 and Olarinre will attend, (i) Kass will meet with Olarinre, individually, at least once a week, and sometimes more often, (ii) Kass's review of Olarinre's progress will be continual (i.e., at least weekly), (iii) Kass will not assume Olarinre has absorbed aspects of research and professional development unless they have been assessed, and (iv) Kass and Olarinre will have frequent discussions about future publication plans, presentation plans, and PhD program milestone plans; from time to time they will also talk about career goals, and strategies for achieving them. Research Methods As we said, Olarinre's courses have provided him the foundational theory and meth- ods for statistical machine learning (he will be ﬁnished with coursework at the end of this semester). Be- coming an effective researcher in this area requires, in addition, (a) detailed understanding of results from the neuroscience literature, and their experimental contexts; ( b) appreciation of aspects of data collection, including pre-processing steps, that might affect analysis and conclusions; (c) strong cross-disciplinary com- munication skills; (d) an ability to collaborate with other analysts, ranging from postdoctoral researchers to undergraduates; (e) the knowledge and willingness to “break” statistical models in order to evaluate their applicability to the problem at hand; (f) a clear appreciation of what statistical models can and can not accomplish; and (g) the ability to envision a uniﬁed analytical evaluation built from many different compo- nents, and to develop a convincing explanatory description of the work. These elements of research methods provide a checklist for Kass in assessing Olarinre's progress. Assessment comes from probing discussions during individual meetings, as well as the written summaries of work that Kass will require before each weekly meeting (described below). Instruction for Olarinre will come from feedback, but will be reinforced by general comments—not directed at speciﬁc individuals—in group meetings. In addition, component skills in research methods are apparent in oral presentations, writing for publication, and writing to meet the requirements of PhD program milestones. Individual meetings with Kass Olarinre will present his work in a structured form. Prior to each meeting, Olarinre will send to Kass a short document that contains key ﬁgures and equations, together with very concise explanations and conclusions; it will also include any concerns and queries he might have, and his thoughts on next steps, mainly for the following week. All points of summary and interpretation will have to be presented as whole-sentence bullet points, and all ﬁgures must have detailed captions to make them largely self-contained. Kass has found the whole-sentence bullet points, especially, to be an extremely useful device for trainees: it forces them to articulate a series of ideas that express, conceptually, their key ﬁndings and observations. This special format has challenged Olarinre, as it does many students—it's easy to avoid following the format when rushed, but the beneﬁts are improved communication, together with development of a skill that will serve him well for future oral and written presentations. By including next steps, in writing, he will habituate his planning process. As he reviews the previous week's plans together with their current week's results, Olarinre will gain conﬁdence in his progress. Furthermore, such documents can grow relatively easily into manuscripts. Kass emphasizes the importance of writing, and will guide Olarinre toward clarifying the structure and style of his written work, in conjunction with improving its substance. Mentoring topics and timeline In addition to the speciﬁcs of research, and its presentation, the mentoring that Kass will provide to Olarinre will include multiple topics. We have structured these again in a kind of check-list format (like the multiple aspects of research methods) and, in addition, have laid out a detailed timeline for them, in tabular form. The topics are explained brieﬂy, following the table itself. 4  21 Su 21 F 22 S 22 Su 22 F 23 S 23 Su 23 F 24 S 24 Su Milestones X X X Publications X X X X  Meetings X X X X  Teaching X X  Writing Skills X X X X X X  Presentation Skills X X X X X X X X X X Grant Writing X X  Reviewing X X  Time Management X X X X  Ethics X X X  Jobs X X X  Meet with Brown X X  Program milestones: These include ﬁnishing, presenting, and writing up an Advanced Data Analysis project in Fall 2021, the thesis proposal, in the summer of 2023; and the thesis defense in the summer of 2024. The Advanced Data Analysis project must involve a major cross-disciplinary effort (at least 12 months) and Olarinre must have an external co-advisor in addition to Kass. Olarinre's research has been done in collaboration with Dr. Joshua Siegle at the Allen Brain Institute. Dr. Siegle provided a letter of collaboration for the most recent grant application submission, and he will serve as formal co-advisor. Pub- lications: We anticipate 3 publications from the thesis, with the ﬁrst being based on the Advanced Data Analysis project; initial work on the ﬁrst paper will begin by the end of this summer, after which Olarinre will focus entirely on ﬁnishing the research and presenting it, with the paper being completed and submitted during Spring 2022. Work on the second paper will occur in conjunction with the thesis proposal in Spring 2023, while the third paper will be written in time for its incorporation into the thesis itself, in Spring 2024. Meetings: Olarinre will attend and present results at multiple meetings, including the 2022 international meeting on Statistical Analysis of Neural Data (SAND10), the 2023 meeting on computational and systems neuroscience (COSYNE), and the 2023 Joint Statistical Meeting. This latter is the largest statistical meeting in the world, and one of the best opportunities for networking. At all of these meetings Kass will make sure Olarinre is “plugged in,” by introducing him to researchers at different levels of seniority who share his interests. In 2024 Olarinre will attend at least one additional meeting, possibly the annual meeting of the biometric society (ENAR) during the Spring. Teaching: Large undergraduate enrollments at institutions like CMU have made teaching assistants essential to delivery of most courses offered by departments like Statistics & Data Science. Since our ﬁrst NSF training grant in 1996, Kass has recognized a much broader importance of TAing and related experiences to the development of graduate students in statistics. One of the pillars in our understanding is the recognition that much the same skills are used when teaching as when communicating technical material to less technical collaborators. Thus, regardless of Olarinre's ultimate career path, he will be served well by understanding what makes teachers effective, and by guided practice. Olarinre will serve as TA during Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. (While he is TAing, Olarinre will not be supported by this supplement.) Because he is in the joint PhD program with Machine Learning, he is expected to serve as a TA for one of their courses and one of the courses offered by Statistics & Data Science. We are very fortunate to have here at CMU a leading center for teaching, the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, the director of which, who holds a PhD in cognitive psychology, Kass collaborated with extensively early in her career. The center is a national leader in the formulation of good practices for undergraduate teaching and is unusual in its explicit use, in its many programs and materials, of high-quality research in educational psychology. The Eberly Center offers a series of workshops for graduate students, which Olarinre will at- 5 tend. Writing Skills: In addition to what we have already said, the timeline indicates when attention will be focused on document production. Presentation Skills: This is continual, through group presentations. Kass will review slides and provide feedback during practice sessions for all milestones and professional meeting presentations. Grant writing: Kass will go over with the NeuroStats group the process of grant writing, and with Olarinre individually as preparation for his thesis proposal and for his postdoctoral job search. On these occasions Olarinre will produce a short mock grant proposal, including speciﬁc aims, that Kass and others will critique. Reviewing: Kass is frequently asked to review articles for publication in leading journals and almost always asks a trainee to serve as a co-reviewer. Olarinre will get the chance to review such articles on at least two occasions, planned for summer of 2022 and 2023, as those are times with minimal additional responsibilities for him. Kass will guide him through the process. This is also a general topic that comes up in our NeuroStats research group, so discussions there (with several faculty) will reinforce best practices. Time management: Kass will review with Olarinre his strategies and tactics for time management, especially when key deadlines are looming. Ethics: Kass will discuss ethical issues with Olarinre as they arise naturally during the interdisciplinary collaboration and publication process. In addition, formal sessions will occur in the NeuroStats group. Topics Kass plans to discuss, and has discussed with other groups previously, include individual responsibilities when working together as a team across se- niority levels; determining authorship; plagiarism and acknowledgment of previous work; responsibility to publish; redundancy or duplication of publications; integrity in reporting statistical results; careful attention to statistical assumptions; making data and code available; intellectual property involving novel methodol- ogy; accuracy, acknowledgment of previous results, and responsibility to educate during oral presentations; conﬁdentiality and impartiality in reviewing the work of others; honest representation of work, accuracy of budgets, and responsible use of funds in grant proposals; types of scientiﬁc misconduct; complexity of typ- ical scenarios; responsibility and appropriate channels for reporting. Sessions are planned for each Spring, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Job hunting: Kass will ask several former trainees to discuss with the NeuroStats group their experiences, including types of jobs, interview preparation, honest representation of self, and the problem of assessing the multiple trade-offs among alternatives. These sessions are planned for each Fall, 2021, 2022, 2023. Kass will of course also discuss all of these topics with Olarinre when it is time for him to begin his search for his next position, presumably as a postdoctoral fellow. Additional Mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown Olarinre will be mentored primarily by Kass, with some supplementary mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown, at MIT. Brown has had a long-term collaboration with Kass (they wrote two highly-cited review papers on statistics in neurophysiology as well as an inﬂuential paper on graduate training in statistics). Brown is unusually accomplished: he is an MD-PhD, the only person to hold endowed chairs at both MIT and Harvard Medical School, a member of all 3 National Academies, and he is the 2020 winner of the Swartz Prize in Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neu- roscience. Brown is deeply interested in the research topics Olarinre is pursuing and he is also himself an unusually successful mentor, including of trainees from under-represented groups. Dr. Brown, who is African-American, has also been very involved in diversity efforts at MIT and Harvard Medical School. The additional wisdom and advice Dr. Brown can offer Olarinre will be invaluable. A letter of collaboration for this special purpose is supplied with our application. Speciﬁcally, Brown has agreed to listen to Olarinre give a formal presentation, give him feedback, and discuss with him his goals and progress toward them. This will occur in Spring 2022, before Olarinre gives his ﬁrst presentation at the SAND10 meeting, and again in Summer 2023 in preparation for Olarinre's attendance and presentation at the Joint Statistical Meeting. At that time Brown will also talk to Olarinre about job search, which will be commencing. 6",Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10378845,R01MH064537,"['Academy ', '

"Robust modeling of within- and across-area population dynamics using recurrent neural networks Over the past several decades, the ability to record from large populations of neurons (e.g., multi-electrode arrays, neuropixels, calcium imaging) has increased exponentially, promising new avenues for understanding the brain. These data have the promise to provide a qualitatively different view of activity within and across brain areas than was previously possible, but the effort will require the development of advanced analytical tools. One natural framework is provided by the tools of dynamical systems, which offer the means to uncover coordinated time-varying activation patterns expressed across an interconnected network of recorded neurons, and to characterize how these patterns relate to behavior. This framework has provided fundamental new insights into information processing in these cortical circuits, including those underlying motor, sensory, and cognitive processes. However, previous analytical approaches to uncovering dynamics have typically been developed and tested in specific brain areas, for limited behaviors, in restricted behavioral settings. Ironically, it is not unusual for these methods to have 10^5 parameters that need to be set or learned, and require careful tuning to properly function. Yet the brain is not homogenous, and it is unclear how well these approaches can be made to generalize to a variety of brain areas and behaviors, let alone by researchers who are not intimately familiar with the methods. Further, assuming that the brain's dynamics stem from independent, isolated areas is a vast oversimplification. Clearly, perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions all rely on activity distributed across multiple, interacting brain areas, each of which likely has distinct dynamics. Communication between areas is a dynamic process that underlies flexible function. There is growing recognition that population dynamics are specifically structured to support inter-area interaction, and an immediate need for methods to accurately uncover dynamics between interacting areas.  We will address the challenge of generalized applicability to diverse brain areas by developing a powerful new open-source toolkit for automated discovery of neural population dynamics, within highly divergent brain areas. Further, we will extend this toolkit with new neural network architectures to model the dynamics between interacting areas. Our approach, the Dynamical Systems ID toolkit (DSID), will support accurate and straightforward application to data from different brain areas and behaviors without requiring great expertise or infrastructure setup. DSID will leverage sequential autoencoders (SAEs), powerful and flexible deep learning architectures that use recurrent neural networks to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems. We will validate the generalizability of DSID using a combination of previously-collected and new multi-electrode recording data from monkeys, including motor, sensory, and cognitive areas of cortex. Following their development and validation in our labs, we will work to disseminate them throughout the appropriate research communities where we expect they will be further developed with application to an even broader range of brain areas and behaviors.

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,10053729,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' expectation ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,682901
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers

"Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit Project Summary/Abstract Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse. However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are implemented in neural systems. Project Narrative Although the ability of the nervous system to predict sensory input is critical for accurate perceptions, coordinated movements, and normal cognitive function, detailed accounts of the underlying neural circuitry and plasticity are lacking. This proposal addresses this challenge by applying novel experimental approaches and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system where neural correlates for learned predictions are highly accessible to mechanistic investigation. The detailed circuit-level models we plan to develop will provide a foundation for understanding how disruptions of predictive mechanisms contribute to neurological disorders.",Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit,10206425,R01NS075023,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Electric Fish ', ' Electric Organ ', ' electroplax ', ' fish electric organ ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mormyridae ', ' Elephantfishes ', ' Mormyrids ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Posture ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Swimming ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' insight ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' lobes ', ' Lobe ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,538626
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined.

"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10200162,U19NS112953,"['Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Logic ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Odors ', ' olfactory bulb ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Sense Organs ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Odorant Receptors ', ' Odor Receptor Protein ', ' Odorant Receptor Proteins ', ' Olfactory Receptor Proteins ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' olfactory stimulus ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' piriform cortex ', ' Nasal Epithelium ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' olfactory receptor ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' combinatorial ', ' stimulus processing ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2021,3763502
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,10247567,U19NS104648,"['Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Data Science ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' social computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Bipolar Depression ', ' bipolar depressed ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2021,3062362
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and

"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation.

"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Virus ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH Technic ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH assay ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' fear memory ', ' memory consolidation ', ' graph theory ', ' in vivo calcium imaging ', ' In vivo two-photon calcium imaging ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will.

"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10216373,R01NS117901,"['Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Ketamine ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Propofol ', ' Diprivan ', ' Disoprofol ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Adrenergic Receptor ', ' Adrenoceptors ', ' Epinephrine Receptors ', ' adenoreceptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' sedative ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors ', ' N-Methylaspartate Receptors ', ' NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex ', ' NMDA Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Dexmedetomidine ', ' Pulvinar structure ', ' Pulvinar ', ' pulvinar thalami ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' Shapes ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' paired stimuli ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Disinhibition ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' postsynaptic ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural correlate ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,458246
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Networks ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' sensor ', ' Pyramidal Cells ', ' Link ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' electrical property ', ' experience ', ' immunoreactivity ', ' voltage ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' patch clamp ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' environmental enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environment enrichment ', ' environment enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environmental enrichment ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Interneuron function ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translatome ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' rabies viral tracing ', ' rabies tracing ', ' rabies virus tracing ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,10132393,R01MH060974,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Myelin ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Rest ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Tracer ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Heritability ', ' analytical tool ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' brain circuitry ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' connectome ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' Injections ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' Visualization ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,618537
