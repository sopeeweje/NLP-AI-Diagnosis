"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Blood Vessels ', '

"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst -

"mHealth-based Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Physical Activity Levels of Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary The lack of regular physical activity (PA) in over 290,000 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States (US) is an ongoing health crisis. This lack of activity has potentially devastating consequences because low levels of PA in people with SCI elevates the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and lung disease. Furthermore, low levels of PA in individuals with SCI have been associated with secondary conditions such as pain, fatigue, weight gain, and deconditioning. Regular PA and exercise-based interventions have been linked with improved outcomes and healthier lifestyles among those with SCI. Sensor- based activity monitors can assess PA and exercise interventions by quantifying wheelchair movement, movement of the individual, and physiological changes. However, these monitors do not provide real-time, tailored feedback and recommendations that might help individuals with SCI increase their PA levels in the community. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate a sensor-enabled, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) strategy to increase and sustain PA levels among individuals with SCI in their communities. The long-term goal of this research is to effectively integrate a mobile health JITAI with existing PA intervention programs to motivate health-related behavior change in individuals with SCI. A primary objective of this proposal is to extend our pilot work to evaluate the integration of a JITAI with a web-based 14-week PA intervention program from the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the integration of web-based PA intervention program with JITAI will result in significantly higher PA levels over 14 weeks compared to the standard we-based PA intervention program alone. A secondary objective of this study is to extend existing algorithms that use commercial wearable technology to robustly detect PA behaviors to facilitate the delivery of tailored just-in-time actionable feedback and PA recommendations for individuals with SCI (Aims 3 and 4). The integration of the JITAI, which provides feedback and PA recommendations due to sensor-based assessments of PA, with the standard web-based PA intervention program will be tested via a clinical trial that combines a randomized controlled trial and a micro-randomized trial. Our team includes investigators with expertise in SCI research, mobile health, PA tracking, and behavioral change interventions. The proposed study will yield novel insights about JITAIs and JITAIs combined with more traditional, web-based PA intervention programs, which will help researchers design engaging PA interventions for individuals with disability in the community that may improve their health and quality of life.

"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment

"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,10107795,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary

"Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies PROJECT SUMMARY Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with, ultimately, irreversible axonal injury leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Preventing disease progression or treating progressive MS remains a major unmet clinical need. We have previously developed a novel data-driven model-selection diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to accurately image inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury, as well as quantifying axonal loss in the presence of vasogenic edema in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and spinal cord injury mice, and brain WM pathologies in MS. MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, reflecting a weighted-average of signals between the two compartments. However, our recent observation that DBSI derived axial diffusivity (DBSI-λǁ) was slightly elevated in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in people with MS (pwMS). This elevated DBSI-λǁ added uncertainty in assessing whether axonal injury (against the notion that ↓DBSI-λǁ ≈ axonal injury) is present in NAWM of these pwMS. In this proposed study, we will refine DBSI to further improve its sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury/loss, demyelination, and inflammation for accurately assessing disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in pwMS. Since MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, it reflects a weighted-average between inter- and intra-axonal signals. In the presence of inflammation-associated edema or minor axonal loss in pwMS, the longer diffusion time for human scanners coupled with the increased inter-axonal space will lead to increased DBSI-λǁ masking the detectability of axonal injury. Thus, through separating inter- and intra-axonal water compartment signals, the sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury of DBSI-derived intra-axonal λ|| (DBSI-IA-λ||) may be improved. This new model will still preserve the isotropic diffusion specificity to inflammation and tissue loss. We propose three specific aims to prove or disprove this hypothesis: Aim 1. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA analyses on autopsy specimens from pwMS followed by conventional histology and immunohistochemical staining. Aim 2. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA modeling on perfused frog sciatic nerve with and without contrast agent to separate inter-/intra-axonal space water signal. Aim 3a. To develop a Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) approach combining DBSI/DBSI-IA metrics and machine/deep learning algorithms to recapitulate histology specificity to MS pathology. Aim 3b. To translate DBSI-IA model to analyze existing DWI data from the cohort of pwMS previously imaged in an expired program project. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, affecting over 700,000 people in the US. It is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with pronounced axon damage inflicting long-term neurological disability. Accurate assessment of axonal injury early especially in normal appearing white matter is crucially important in therapeutic intervention. For example, we cannot expect remyelination to work on absent or critically injured axons. Thus, the proposed diffusion basis spectrum imaging to model intra-axonal diffusion for improving the sensitivity of detecting axonal injury is of great importance in treating and curing MS.",Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies,10121338,R01NS116091,"['Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' central nervous system demyelinating disorder ', ' central nervous system demyelinating disease ', ' Demyelinating Diseases ', ' Demyelinating Disorders ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diffusion ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ', ' EAE ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalitis ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis ', ' autoimmune encephalomyelitis ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Germany ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Inflammation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Masks ', ' Minor ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myelin ', ' Nerve ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Pathology ', ' Perfusion ', ' Rana ', ' Frog ', ' sciatic nerve ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Specificity ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Temperature ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tolonium chloride ', ' Toluidine Blue ', ' Translating ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Fast Blue ', ' Gadolinium DTPA ', ' Gadopentetic Acid ', ' Gd-DTPA ', ' Gadopentetate Dimeglumine ', ' Gadolinium DTPA Dimeglumine ', ' Gadolinium DTPA Dimeglumine Salt ', ' Magnevist ', ' manganese chloride ', ' MnCl2 ', ' manganese dichloride ', ' manganous chloride ', "" Ringer's solution "", ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' remyelination ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Periodic Acid Schiff ', ' Periodic acid Schiff stain method ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cellularity ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Coupled ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectral image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' axon injury ', ' axon damage ', ' axonal damage ', ' axonal injury ', ' vasogenic edema ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' preservation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,473791
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury. PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus, we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure. Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI’s effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro. We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48’s five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury.,10393353,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' axonal sprouting ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' axon growth ', ' axonal growth ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' SCI Patients ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,16781
"Predicting Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia Using Machine Learning Models (PREMIER) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting multiple end organs, with complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Albuminuria, an early measure of glomerular injury, is common in SCD and predicts progressive kidney disease. Kidney function decline is faster in SCD patients than in the general African American population. The prevalence of rapid decline in SCD is 3-fold higher than in the general population. Furthermore, high-risk APOL1 variants are associated with an increased risk of albuminuria and progression of CKD in SCD. Kidney disease, regardless of severity, and rapid eGFR decline are associated with increased mortality in SCD. As such, early identification of patients at risk for progression of CKD is important to address potentially modifiable risk factors, slow eGFR decline and reduce mortality. Despite the high prevalence of CKD and its contribution to increased morbidity and mortality, available treatments for SCD-related kidney disease remain limited. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and hydroxyurea decrease albuminuria in short-term studies, their benefits in preventing or slowing progressive loss of kidney function in SCD remain undefined. We have recently reported that machine learning (ML) models can identify patients at high risk for rapid decline in kidney function. Further, higher hemoglobin concentration is also an independent predictor of decreased odds of rapid kidney function decline. With the contribution of intravascular hemolysis to the pathophysiology of SCD-related glomerulopathy, voxelotor, a small molecule which modifies sickle hemoglobin oxygen affinity and improves sickle RBC survival, may decrease glomerular injury and slow the progression of CKD in individuals with SCD. In this application, we propose the conduct of a prospective, multicenter study to build a ML-based predictive model for progression of CKD in adults with SCD. Furthermore, in individuals predicted to be at risk for rapid decline in kidney function, based on the presence of persistent albuminuria (urine ACR ≥ 100 mg/g), we will evaluate the effect of voxelotor on albuminuria, rapid decline in kidney function and progression of CKD. With advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications, combined with an increasing number of approved drug therapies, early identification of patients at risk for progressive kidney disease and subsequent increased risk of death is necessary to modify known risk factors, initiate targeted therapies and possibly increase life expectancy. Further, with the known contribution of hemolytic anemia to the pathogenesis of SCD-related glomerulopathy and progressive kidney disease, drugs that decrease hemolysis are likely to be beneficial in preventing and/or slowing the progression of kidney disease in this patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by involvement of multiple end organs, resulting in multiple complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD as well as rapid decline of kidney function are common in SCD, and are associated with increased risk of death. We propose studies to identify individuals at high risk for progression of CKD using machine learning models, and to evaluate the kidney-protective effects of voxelotor, a novel inhibitor of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, in individuals at risk for rapid decline in kidney function.",Predicting Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia Using Machine Learning Models (PREMIER),10280257,R01HL159376,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Hemolytic Anemia ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemolysis ', ' erythrolysis ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' polymerization ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' sickling inhibitor ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2021,705287
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A

"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10246175,K23HD096134,"['Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Secondary to ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' muscle strength ', ' Coin ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Movement science ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' translational study ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' neurological recovery ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' patient mobility ', ' biopsychosocial factor ', ' biopsychosocial variable ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,127999
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10261451,R33MH118170,"['Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' concussion ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Probes ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' Seizures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' innovative technologies ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Devices ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10223451,K23NS114201,"['Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurological Models ', ' Neurologic Models ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' drug-related adverse effects ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Training ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' active comparator ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' improved outcome ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' phenotypic data ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' stroke patient ', ' side effect ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status. Project Narrative World Health Organization has reported that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). The overall objective of this study is to use trauma, acute, and patient- level characteristics to explain the functional recovery of individuals with SCI over time, post-injury.",Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury,10228554,R03HD101064,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Locomotion ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' functional status ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' feeding ', ' community living ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' functional improvement ', ' function improvement ', ' neurological recovery ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' trauma care ', ' functional adaptation ', ' physical therapist ', ' physiotherapist ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' advanced analytics ', ' acute care ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R03,2021,162122
"Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US Proposed Approach: We will build three national cohorts of children requiring emergency services over a 10-year period to evaluate primary, secondary, and tertiary firearm injury prevention. We will use existing research infrastructure, data science methods, the ability to track children to one year, novel analytics, and an interdisciplinary team to address this critical public health need. Importance: Injury remains the leading cause of death in children, with firearms resulting in the highest mortality, surgical intervention, critical care, and cost compared to all other mechanisms of injury. However, there are many challenges to firearm injury prevention in children. Risk prediction tools are sparse, firearm injury recidivism and death are concerns among children who initially survive such an injury, and processes of care to optimize survival are under-investigated. There is a compelling need for research in these areas to facilitate targeted interventions to reduce firearm injury and mortality among at-risk children. Objectives: The proposal has 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Using three national cohorts of children 0 to 17 years requiring emergency services, employ machine learning and geospatial analysis to develop and validate risk prediction models for firearm injury and short-term mortality using individual-, home-, incident-, and county-level factors. Specific Aim 2. Among children discharged alive following a firearm injury, measure injury recidivism, healthcare utilization, and mortality to 1-year and develop risk prediction models to identify children at-risk of adverse outcomes in the year after an index firearm event. Specific Aim 3: For children presenting to an ED after a firearm injury, identify ED and hospital characteristics independently associated with in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year survival, and quantify the additional lives saved through feasible shifts in the location of initial emergency care. Study Design & Setting: We will build 3 cohorts of children using emergency services from 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2021 in 1,217 EDs in 8 states (ED cohort), 832 trauma centers in 50 states (Trauma Center cohort), and 5,461 EMS agencies in 28 states (EMS cohort). We will link six different data sources to the cohorts to capture longitudinal outcomes and 110 predictor variables at the patient-, incident-, home-, and county-level. Participants: Children 0–17 years using emergency services, including: 40.9 million in the ED cohort (n = 35,240 with firearm injuries), 620,007 in the Trauma Center cohort (n = 22,847 with firearm injuries), and 6.8 million in the EMS cohort (n = 14,314 with firearm injuries). Outcome measures: We will evaluate models for firearm injury, adverse events to 1-year among children initially surviving a firearm injury, and short- and long-term survival following a firearm injury. Project Narrative Reducing firearm injuries and related mortality in children is a critical public health priority. We will build three unique national cohorts of children injured by firearms and served by different aspects of the US emergency care system (emergency medical services, emergency departments, and trauma centers). Using these cohorts, novel analytic methods, and predictors at the patient-, home-, incident-, and county-levels, we will develop risk prediction models to: identify children at risk of firearm injuries (primary injury prevention); children at risk of adverse outcomes to one year after initially surviving a firearm injury (secondary injury prevention); and ED and hospital factors associated with optimal survival after firearm injury (tertiary injury prevention).",Risk prediction and optimizing outcomes to 1-year after firearm injury among children using emergency services in the US,10399358,R01HD108017,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Firearms ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' trauma centers ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Natural History ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' pediatric department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' recidivism ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' neglect ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injured child ', ' injured children ', ' injury in children ', ' pediatric injury ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' high risk ', ' public health priorities ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Data Science ', ' Gun injury ', ' firearm injury ', ' care costs ', ' emergency settings ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' child services ', ' pediatric services ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1991980
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Adult

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10264065,K01TW011782,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' traffic collision ', ' traffic crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,138024
"Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring mechanical ventilation is a common, costly condition with high mortality, yet treatment remains supportive. Identifying effective targeted therapeutics in heterogeneous conditions like AHRF depends on characterizing subsets, or sub-phenotypes, of patients with high likelihood of disease related events or response to therapy. This project will characterize a novel sub- phenotype called persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) among mechanically ventilated AHRF patients, with PHRF defined by ongoing mechanical ventilation and hypoxemia on ICU day 3. Using clinical trajectory to define sub-phenotypes in other heterogeneous syndromes has helped delineate patients with distinct prognosis and highlight biologic mechanisms contributing to trajectories. With large, independent prospective ICU cohorts from the University of Washington and Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sathe will address the following aims: (1) identify clinical factors on ICU day 1 associated with PHRF (2) determine biologic features of PHRF by analyzing ICU day 1 and day 3 circulating biomarkers of lung injury and (3) develop and validate a multivariable model that predicts PHRF on ICU day 3. Understanding risk factors for PHRF will help hone in on the early mechanisms important for pathologic responses to lung injury. Advantages to sub- phenotyping within AHRF rather than ARDS (where prior efforts were focused) include expanding the scope of patients we target for therapy and improving reliability of study definitions. In addition, discriminating between patients who will and will not develop PHRF will aid clinical prognostication, resource allocation, and targeted trial enrollment of patients unlikely to improve with existing treatment. The results will fill key knowledge gaps prioritized by the NHLBI regarding which factors determine risk for persistent hypoxemia, and the degree to which these factors overlap across ARDS and other conditions in AHRF. Candidate/Environment: With the support of the University of Washington, Dr. Mark Wurfel, Dr. Catherine “Terri” Hough, and biostatistician Leila Zelnick, PhD, this award will help establish Dr. Sathe’s career as a translational physician-scientist practicing Pulmonary and Critical Care. Through the proposed research, she will develop fundamental skills for analysis of longitudinal cohort data, contemporary machine learning methods for prediction, and high-quality measurement and analysis of lung injury biomarkers. This work will identify biologic pathways for more in-depth study in prospective AHRF cohorts, which she will pursue in a future K23. She plans to establish a career examining the heterogeneity of acute respiratory failure and other ICU syndromes, to advance the development of targeted therapeutics for critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterogeneity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), which includes such conditions as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, has hampered the identification of effective, targeted therapeutics. Characterizing a subset of mechanically ventilated AHRF patients with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) will help identify patients unlikely to improve with existing treatments and early biologic events leading to persistent hypoxemia. Examining the large, reliably defined group of AHRF instead of ARDS may expand who we target for new therapeutics, and clarify how biologic processes overlap across ARDS and other AHRF conditions.",Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure,10231616,F32HL158088,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Characteristic ', ' Biological Characteristics ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' male ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Ang-2 ', ' Ang2 ', ' Angiopoietin-2 ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' response ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' circulating biomarkers ', ' circulating markers ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' translational physician ', ' translational clinician ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' participant enrollment ', ' patient enrollment ', ' acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ', ' acute hypoxic respiratory failure ', ' acute onset hypoxemic respiratory failure ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,79386
"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability. This project will identify biomechanical and biological predictors of cartilage degeneration after meniscus injury and partial meniscectomy.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support.

"An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH); as a result, there is increasing pressure to identify neural targets for effective therapies. However, to develop effective HAND treatments, there is a strong need for the development of sensitive behavioral tests that can quickly screen and effectively identify probable neurocognitive impairment in PWH and biomarkers that can accurately determine HAND status and evaluate therapeutic effects. This 5-year cross-sectional and longitudinal study is theoretically driven and specifically designed to tackle these challenges. Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits (plus hippocampus, thalamus, and other associated regions) has long been recognized as a key component in HAND; however, the association between frontostriatal injury and HAND status remains to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that injury to different key regions in the frontostriatal circuits may play differential roles in HAND status: frontal injury is more prevalent in PWH, but striatal injury better predicts HAND status. This suggests that an accurate assessment of neural injury at different frontostriatal regions (plus other key regions such as hippocampus and thalamus) may have the potential to serve as a biomarker to assist with HAND diagnosis and characterization. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate frontostriatal injury in PWH using two behavioral paradigms that are known to involve distinct frontostriatal regions, along with two advanced functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, fMRI- adaptation (fMRI-A) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Compared to conventional fMRI techniques, fMRI-A and MVPA techniques can better estimate neural tuning/selectivity that can be directly related to behavioral performance. Briefly, we hypothesize that frontostriatal injury – a central component in HAND – is highly prevalent in PWH and can be assessed behaviorally via two behavioral paradigms (Aim 1), and neurally via fMRI-A & MVPA (Aim 2). The integration of behavioral and fMRI data will help to assess the degree of neural injury at different frontostriatal and associated regions, which in turn may serve as a biomarker for HAND status (Aim 3). The probable impact of common comorbidities (e.g., history of substance and alcohol abuse, etc.) will also be investigated. In summary, this proposal is theoretically driven and highly innovative, with a strong promise for future clinically relevant development. The feasibility of the proposed research is supported by a strong foundation in cognitive neuroscience and neuroHIV, strong preliminary data, and an established research team. The success of this proposed project may help to develop sensitive behavioral tests that can effectively detect mild neurocognitive impairment in PWH, and a biomarker that can assist in determining HAND status/severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, remains high in people with HIV (PWH). Neural injury to the frontostriatal circuits has been proposed as a key component in HAND, but the precise neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Built upon rich cognitive neuroscience literature and inspired by recent findings in neuroHIV research, we propose a functional MRI (fMRI) study to investigate functional disruptions to the frontostriatal circuits in PWH, using a novel combination of established behavioral test paradigms and advanced fMRI techniques.",An advanced functional MRI study of frontostriatal injury in adults with HIV,10450246,R56NS124422,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Mediating ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modality ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' mild neurocognitive impairment ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV 1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder ', ' neuroAIDS ', ' neuro-AIDS ', ' neuro-HIV ', ' neuroHIV ', ' ']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,585657
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Using Machine Learning for Early Recognition and Personalized Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized patients and is associated with increased risk of readmission, morbidity, and mortality. The estimated annual cost of AKI care in the US is over 10 billion dollars, and, with the incidence rising, these costs will continue to increase. The current gold standards for diagnosing AKI, creatinine and urine output, are often delayed in their recognition of tubular injury. Prior work on AKI has typically focused on patients who have already developed AKI based on these standards, and interventions at this late time point have had mixed success. In contrast, emerging data suggest that intervening earlier can improve outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients.  We have previously developed a machine learning tool to identify patients at high risk of severe (stage 2 or greater) AKI more than a day earlier than clinically apparent using structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Although more accurate than prior methods, it suffers from a high rate of false positives, which limits its value in clinical practice. There is a large amount of valuable information that is stored in unstructured free-text fields (e.g., clinical notes) that could be utilized using natural language processing (NLP) within advanced deep learning neural network models that could significantly improve the detection of early AKI. Furthermore, there are established and emerging kidney injury biomarkers that could be combined with EHR-based models to improve accuracy even further. Finally, it remains unclear what interventions will have the best chance of decreasing the risk for developing severe AKI in high-risk patients. A better understanding of which interventions are of greatest benefit to specific patients is critical for improving the outcomes of patients at risk of AKI.  The objective of this project is to develop novel tools to improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk of AKI using a large, multicenter cohort. In Aim 1, we will use NLP and deep learning algorithms to develop a model to predict severe AKI across four health systems. In Aim 2, we will silently run the best- performing model developed in Aim 1 in real-time to identify high-risk patients. Manual retrospective chart review will be performed on a cohort of the highest risk patients to determine both the proportion of patients who receive guideline-based care as well as the association between receipt of guideline-based care and outcomes. We will also identify novel phenotypes of patients who are particularly helped or harmed by specific guideline-based interventions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will collect kidney injury biomarkers in the highest-risk patients to determine the added value of biomarkers to EHR-based models alone. Our proposal will provide clinicians with new tools to identify patients at risk of AKI earlier and more accurately. It will also provide evidence for which interventions are most likely to improve patient outcomes. This will result in earlier, more personalized care for patients at high risk of AKI, which will lead to decreased costs, morbidity, and mortality.

"GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors Abstract Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000 cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. Untreated sepsis may result in dilated and leaky blood vessels and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive medications (aka septic shock), and eventual injury to kidneys, lungs, and liver (aka organ injury) with mortality rates in excess of 40%. Successful prevention and management of sepsis, septic shock, and organ injury rely on the ability of clinicians to anticipate and estimate the risk, and administer the right life-saving treatments (e.g., antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors) at the right time. In recent years, data-driven modeling has been shown to enable early prediction of sepsis and to reveal clusters (or phenotypes) of sepsis, which may help with personalizing therapeutic interventions. However, crossing the translational chasm between clinical research and improving patient care also requires addressing 1) `data deserts' at different levels of care through better data integration, smarter lab ordering, and utilization of continuous monitoring wearable sensors; 2) interoperability and portability of clinical data and analytics; 3) principled dissemination and implementation studies; and 4) education of the next generation of caregivers to effectively utilize advanced analytical tools. The proposed research program builds upon PI's K01 early career development award focused on multicenter development and validation of sepsis predictive analytic algorithms (including hourly EHR data spanning ED and inpatient encounters from over 500,000 hospitalized patients across five district healthcare systems). Drawing insights from recent advances in domain adaptation and multi-task learning (sub-fields of machine learning), this project aims to discover generalizable dynamic phenotypes that are directly relevant to the prediction and management of sepsis, septic shock, and downstream organ injury. We propose to augment EHR-based analytics with high-resolution data from bedside devices (e.g., monitors, ventilators, dialysis, and IV pumps) and wearables (e.g., continuous blood pressure and lactate sensors) to address existing gaps in monitoring. Additionally, this program aims at advancing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) interoperability standards through the implementation of specific resources for high-resolution data sources. Finally, this research program will be conducted in close collaboration with our dissemination and implementation and hospital quality improvement teams to ensure early assessment of usability, barriers to implementation, and effective education to maximize the potential for clinical impact. Project Narrative The proposed project is making use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and computers to collect and analyze data from hospitalized patients with sepsis. We plan to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for deterioration and which treatments they may benefit. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the care of hospitalized patients with sepsis.",GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors,10277331,R35GM143121,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Ventilator ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data integration ', ' next generation ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' analytical tool ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' advanced analytics ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' Dissemination and Implementation ', ' implementation study ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000
"Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury After a spinal cord injury (SCI), clinicians must quickly decide where to focus therapy time to maximize an individual's functional mobility by discharge: either towards gait training or wheeled mobility interventions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in making those difficult decisions, but literature has shown that for individuals with moderate impairments, current CPRs that use age, strength, and sensation are not sufficient in predicting independent ambulation. Further, existing CPRs do not provide insight into clinically important descriptive measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance that contribute to functional ambulation. Our recent work demonstrated individuals who received gait training, but primarily used a wheelchair one year after SCI received less transfer and wheeled mobility training and had lower measures of participation than non-ambulatory individuals who never received gait training. In the context of decreasing inpatient rehabilitation length of stays, it is crucial that time in therapy be used efficiently to maximize function at discharge and avoid those long-term consequences.  Lower limb movement (LLM) captured using activity monitors may provide a more sensitive measure of strength and sensation than traditional methods such as manual muscle and light touch sensation testing. This technique is novel in that LLM has not yet been reported in literature for individuals with SCI. Our preliminary analysis has shown promise for the association between LLM, strength, and ambulatory ability (as defined by measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance). Using machine learning techniques, we are able to determine which factors have the strongest association with ambulatory ability, among LLM, subject demographics, clinical characteristics, and other covariates.  Our long-term goal is to improve CPRs that predict ambulation after SCI, thus enabling appropriately targeted functional mobility training. As a first step towards this goal, we will build a foundational knowledge of LLM and its relationship as a potential biomarker for ambulatory ability cross-sectionally among individuals with chronic SCI and known, diverse functional abilities (Aim 1). We will also explore longitudinal LLM data and ambulatory ability for a population with acute SCI (Aim 2) to evaluate changes in LLM over time and create a preliminary prediction model.  Achieving the proposed aims will provide new insights into factors that predict mobility in individuals with SCI and provide understanding as to how these factors change acutely following injury. Further, we will gain insight to guide a future multisite longitudinal study that will assess a new, more effective CPR. This CPR will aid clinical decision-making for individuals with SCI by allowing for optimally targeted therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum, thus improving long-term functional outcomes. Project Narrative Current rules are not sufficient in predicting ambulation among individuals with moderate strength and sensory deficits after a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to an inefficient use of therapy time. By measuring actual lower limb movement using activity monitors, we believe we can capture an unexplained variance missing from current prediction models that use traditional clinical measures to more accurately predict ambulatory ability. Accomplishing the goals outlined in this proposal will provide clinicians with a better understanding of ambulatory prognosis after spinal cord injury and will allow for optimal target therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum to maximize functional outcomes and quality of life.",Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury,10049966,F30HD096828,"['Accounting ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Caffeine ', ' Community Participation ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' spine injury ', ' vertebral injury ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' limb movement ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' independent ambulation ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' spasticity ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' functional independence ', ' Home ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2021,39636
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' prognostic tool ', ' inter-institutional ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' acute care ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' computable phenotypes ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research project Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department (ED) using Artificial Intel- ligence Driven Clinical Decision Support is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)-derived insights into emergency care delivery. This investigation will use the iterative develop- ment and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case.

"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10468485,R00HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Strengthening the Quantitative Pipeline for Multidisciplinary Trauma Research in Cameroon PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly in Cameroon, where a higher burden of injury is reported compared to similar settings in the region. Injury research focused on prevention and improvements in trauma care, such as trauma Quality improvement (QI), have led to significant reductions in the burden of injury in high-income countries. Yet, there remain critical gaps in the current trauma research infrastructure in SSA due to limited training opportunities. The Sustainable Trauma Research, Education, and Mentorship Program (STREaM) will seek to fill this gap, building on an existing long-term partnership between the University of California and the University of Buea (Buea) to provide innovative training to Cameroonian post-graduate candidates with a focus on novel, cutting edge quantitative tools. STREaM Cameroon program will aspire to establish a cadre of graduate trainees with multidisciplinary expertise in Injury prevention and control, quality improvement, and quantitative methods that can address limitations posed by the time-dependent, dynamic, and incomplete nature of trauma-related data. The program will leverage recent advances in research methodologies, such as machine learning and implementation science, that are particularly suited to trauma research. STREaM Cameroon aims to accomplish the following objectives:1) Train a critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists in trauma research through MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral pathways who will form the foundation for an Injury Center at the Buea; 2) Develop and implement a combination of short, medium, and long-term quantitative and trauma research curricula co-taught by U.S. and Cameroonian faculty to sustainably strengthen existing offerings at the Buea; 3) Provide mentored research opportunities for trainees to apply quantitative skills to trauma QI projects utilizing the partnership’s existing research and data collection infrastructure in Cameroon; and 4) Integrate trainee scholars into a robust scientific network through existing international organizations and the creation of a Cameroonian Trauma Network to serve as an ongoing community of practice. During the five-year program, a total of 2 post docs, and eight PhD and Master’s level students per year will be trained using a team mentoring approach. Master’s and PhD students will take part in online courses throughout their training, administered through the University of California Berkeley and University of California San Francisco’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. All students will participate in mentored research. Additionally, post-docs will spend one semester at Berkeley receiving in-person training to prepare them for faculty positions at Buea. Upon completion of the STReaM program, graduates will successfully engage in innovative, evidence-based research to improve the quality of trauma care and reduce the burden of injury among vulnerable populations in SSA. STReaM Cameroon graduates will thus be trained and equipped to mentor the next generation of scientists in trauma research, playing a critical role in influencing healthcare practices and policy locally and internationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the significant burden and predicted future growth of trauma as a public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there remains a gap in trauma research training and distinct limitations in quantitative offerings at institutions of higher education in the region.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10453821,K01TW011782,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' traffic collision ', ' traffic crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,83000
"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Age ', ' ages

"Targeting the B Cell Response to Treat Antibody-Mediated Rejection ABSTRACT Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of solid organ transplants is the leading cause of immunologic graft injury, shortening the half-life of transplants and consequently of transplant recipients. This immunologically mediated process depends on B lymphocyte activation with differentiation to plasma cells (PC) that produce antibodies to the donor organ. Once established, antibodies have proven difficult to eradicate. Establishing an effective and safe way to treat patients with established AMR would potentially increase the half-life of transplanted organs, extend the lives of patients, and reduce the need for re-transplantation, ultimately increasing the number of patients who could receive life-saving organ transplants. Our lab has described an effective therapy in a non- human primate (NHP) sensitized model of kidney transplantation for lowering donor-specific antibody (DSA) and preventing injury from AMR. The treatment depends on PC depletion in combination with germinal center disorganization which together lower alloantibody levels. Dual targeting of the immune system by complementary drugs is based on NHP and human data using a proteasome inhibitor and belatacept. B cell activation and differentiation is inhibited at the same time that PC are depleted. Consequently, DSA declines, inflammation in the kidney resolves, and renal function stabilizes. The impact of this intervention on infection risk is not well defined but is anticipated to increase. We propose to measure the impact of therapy on both HLA-specific and pathogen-specific B memory cells and PC. We hypothesize that there is a hierarchy of susceptibility to therapy, with protective immunity being more resistant than allogeneic B cell memory. We will evaluate the impact of the regimen on T-cell function focusing on cytomegalovirus (CMV). Current therapy of late AMR using therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with or without rituximab has shown variable results and frequent rebound of DSA. A low level of evidence supports the efficacy of these treatments, implying a tremendous need for well-conducted clinical trials to guide treatment of AMR. We propose a Phase I/II randomized, controlled, prospective interventional study of AMR in human kidney transplant patients using combined carfilzomib/belatacept (C/B) therapy with TPE and IVIG compared to TPE/IVIG alone. Outcomes will include the clinical impact of therapy on AMR using the recently validated iBox score for AMR assessment and the number and type of infections using standardized definitions of infection. We will measure the impact of therapy on HLA and pathogen-associated B memory and PC as well as CMV-specific polyfunctional T-cells. We will assess computational digital imaging analysis of AMR non-visual biopsy features to assess whether machine learning algorithms can improve on Banff criteria of AMR to better guide treatment and predict clinical outcome. Since late active and chronic active AMR have such a poor prognosis for kidney transplant patients, we believe that this trial is ethically justified and would potentially yield important safety and preliminary efficacy data that may lead to improved immune management of transplant patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE End stage renal failure represents a massive health care problem for the United States, affecting 650,000 Americans every year, and having a mortality associated with dialysis of 65% within 5 years. $42 billion is spent annually for hemodialysis. Kidney transplantation dramatically reduces the cost of caring for such patients and improves their lifespan.

"A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia 1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. In response to injury, differentiated adult secretory cells in the gastrointestinal tract undergo metaplasia, or the conversion of one cell type to another. In the pancreas, this is called `acinar to ductal metaplasia' (ADM) and it is thought to function in tissue regeneration. The goals of our laboratory are to generate tools to understand the process of ADM, to identify the consortium of ADM cell types that emerge, and to determine their physiological role in tissue injury. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. By the end of her post-doctoral work, the PI showed that differentiated, secretory cell types, such as tuft cells, form in the pancreas in response to ADM (DelGiorno et al. Frontiers in Physiology, 2020). Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells with myriad roles in mediating inflammation. Combining RNA sequencing, electron microscopy (EM), and mouse models of disease, she identified a functional role for tuft cells, the first description in any model of tumorigenesis (DelGiorno et al. Gastroenterology, 2020). Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and EM, she has identified the formation of several additional secretory cell populations in ADM of unknown function, which are now being studied in the DelGiorno laboratory. 3) Overview of future research program. We propose to continue our work on ADM by creating a workflow combining Single cell RNA-seq and EM Analysis (SEMA) to study epithelial heterogeneity in pancreatic injury with and without the genetic manipulation of identified cell types. Volumetric electron microscopy (3DEM) will be used as a substrate on which to map the information provided by scRNA-seq to reveal the spatial relationships between cells and infer the function of individual cell types through the study of their organellar content. Our approach leverages scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to conduct a variety of experiments on the same tissue including: [1] imaging of dehydrated whole-mount samples, [2] wide-field “chip mapping” of large areas of ultrathin sections, and [3] large-scale serial section approaches for 3DEM acquisition. Mapping is enhanced using correlative light and electron microscopy to assign molecular markers identified in scRNA-seq by immunofluorescence to cells with defining characteristics in SEM (e.g., nuclear shape, distribution of mitochondria, etc). Our 3DEM datasets are amenable to high-throughput image processing (e.g., segmentation, geometry processing) using machine learning and deep learning tool kits. Together, these tools provide a novel discovery workflow, which will be applied to projects throughout our laboratory aimed at evaluating cellular heterogeneity in ADM. Our goals for the next five years are to use this SEMA approach to build a multi-dimensional atlas of the cellular content and spatial relationships of the various emergent cell types in ADM. Mouse models lacking individual ADM cell subtypes will be used to assess phenotypic effects on cellular makeup, relative positioning, and disease progression. Together, these studies will provide invaluable insight into the role of ADM in tissue healing and regeneration in the pancreas. Technological advances in single cell RNA sequencing platforms have rapidly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity within complex multicellular organ systems, however validating these data remain a major challenge. Ultrastructural electron microscopy is the gold standard for cell type identification by recognition of definitive physical features, however sample preparation and analysis are arduous and low- throughput. Our laboratory is combining these techniques with deep learning as a novel workflow to predict and confirm epithelial changes in pancreatic metaplasia to understand the processes and mechanisms underlying epithelial injury and regeneration.",A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia,10274940,R35GM142709,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' alimentary tract ', ' digestive canal ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Metaplasia ', ' Metaplastic Change ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' image processing ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Epithelial ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pancreatic Injury ', ' Pancreatic Trauma ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Nuclear ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Metaplastic Cell ', ' Secretory Cell ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' healing ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatial relationship ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Geometry ', ' sequencing platform ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' deep learning ', ' tissue injury ', ' injury to tissue ', ' epithelial injury ', ' pancreatic metaplasia ', ' epithelium regeneration ', ' regenerate epithelium ', ' ']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,396250
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome.

"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Affect ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Closed head injuries ', ' Closed Head Trauma ', ' Nonpenetrating Head Injuries ', ' non-penetrating head injuries ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' controlled cortical impact ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' functional outcomes ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' Data Commons ', ' data framework ', ' data curation ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Hospitalists ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' clinical risk ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' imaging agent ', ' equipment training ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation cost ', ' implementation investment ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",10232055,R01EY031394,"['Abbreviations ', ' Affect ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' Axon ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Retina ', ' central retinal artery ', ' Retinal Artery ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Structure of central vein of the retina ', ' Central Retinal Vein ', ' Retinal Vein ', ' retina blood vessel structure ', ' Retinal Blood Vessels ', ' Retinal Vessels ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Veins ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' vascular factor ', ' vascular component ', ' Measures ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' retinal ischemia ', ' retina ischemia ', ' Velocimetries ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Ocular Tonometry ', ' Intraocular pressure test ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' Performance ', ' retina circulation ', ' attenuation ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Glossary ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Optic Nerve Transections ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' traditional therapy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' data acquisition ', ' prototype ', ' metabolic rate ', ' preservation ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,500718
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' novel ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Myocardial ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' case-based ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individual patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes distress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common and serious complication in youth with 2 diabetes (T2D). Epidemiological data implicate puberty as a major accelerator of kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes, yet the mechanisms by which reproductive maturation results in kidney disease remain unknown. A better understanding of the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney disease is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in high-risk youth with obesity and/or T2D. We hypothesize that youth with obesity and/or T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between increased renal energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity with increased transglomerular transport of protein, and kidney dysfunction. To address these hypotheses, we propose to design an accelerated longitudinal study in which we will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6%) [n=60], and healthy normal weight controls [n=40] at Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-year follow-up. We will combine state-of- the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for quantifying kidney growth, oxygen availability and hemodynamic function with gold-standard measurements of glomerular filtration rate (iohexol clearance), renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance), glomerular size and charge selectivity (dextran and IgG/IgG4 clearance) and assessments of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function (intravenous glucose tolerance test and metabolomics). These experiments are designed to define the mechanisms contributing to kidney injury during puberty and identify novel risk factors and therapeutic targets to mitigate the development of obesity and diabetes-related nephropathy. Project Narrative: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically manifests during or shortly after puberty and is characterized by a greater frequency and severity of diabetic kidney disease compared to adult-onset T2D and type 1 diabetes of similar duration. Puberty is recognized to accelerate kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes and may explain the magnified risk of diabetic kidney disease in youth-onset T2D, yet the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in obesity and youth-onset T2D are unknown. The accelerated longitudinal study proposed in this application seeks to address these substantive gaps in knowledge.","Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT:

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,10145569,R21AG067335,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Atlases ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Crystallization ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' eosinophil ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' male ', ' mast cell ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' mastocyte ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity -

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting ', ' Age

"Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Trauma and other surgically treated conditions are a crippling, unaddressed burden of disease that disproportionately impacts sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) globally. The Data Science Center for the Study of Surgery, Injury, and Equity in Africa (D-SINE-Africa) is a strategic partnership between the University of Buea (Buea), the University of California (Los Angeles (UCLA) and Berkeley), the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon, and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. D-SINE Africa will address the intersection of health disparities with the risk factors and outcomes associated with injury and surgical disease in SSA. Although more abundant than ever, data is still a limited resource in low- and middle-income countries. Our approach views “big data” available in SSA as an opportunity to develop sustainable data-constrained approaches appropriate for resource-constrained settings. Thus, data science will be harnessed to address our Hub's two main goals which are;1) to decrease the burden of injuries and surgical diseases through improved surveillance, prevention, and treatment; and 2) to improve access to quality surgical care in Cameroon and other SSA countries. These goals will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Research 2) Networking and 3) Capacity Building. These aims implemented through three cores (Administrative, Data Management and Analysis, and Capacity Building Cores) and two Research Projects that will be conducted in Cameroon, South Africa, and Uganda. Research Project 1 - Health Equity Surveillance addresses the urgent gap in rapid socioeconomic (SES) estimation necessary to track health equity in acute care settings by applying a clustering algorithm to existing publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys data sets for SSA. Research Project 2 – Trauma Follow Up Prediction aims to improve trauma outcomes by using machine learning to optimize a mobile phone-based screening survey that will identify which trauma patients would benefit from further care after they are discharged from the hospital, again using a data reduction “big data to small data” approach in line with the Hub's commitment to sustainable data use practices. These projects utilize common data sources (Cameroon Trauma Registry), have harmonizing themes (injury, equity, and data reduction), and will yield findings that can be used together (e.g., identification of SES groups vulnerable to poor follow up care). The Hub has innovatively built community engagement vehicles into the Internal Advisory Board to promote a multi-faceted approach to building trust with research participants and end-users. D-SINE Africa efforts will drive innovation and impact in data science, injury, and equity research to improve access to surgical disease prevention and care, including those whose SES conspires to increase their vulnerability to injury and surgical conditions while reducing consistent surgical care access. D-SINE Africa's strategic partners joint infrastructure are available for use by its members and DSI-Africa consortium at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries and other surgically treated diseases comprise a significant burden of disease in Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries with deep inequities that are particularly unmasked in acute care settings. D-SINE Africa Hub will focus on the intersection between injury and equity, leveraging data science to decrease the impact of trauma, surgical disease, and disparities on the population of Cameroon and SSA by promoting collaborative research, networking, and capacity building with an emphasis on equity.",Harnessing Data Science to Promote Equity in Injury and Surgery for Africa,10314099,U54TW012087,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Cameroon ', ' Communities ', ' Congo ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' South Africa ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' SINEs ', ' Short Interspersed DNA Sequence Elements ', ' Short Interspersed Element ', ' Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Office of Administrative Management ', ' Administrative Management ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' data reduction ', ' injury burden ', ' screening ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Data Science ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' treatment services ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' acute care ', ' disease disparity ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF BUEA,U54,2021,1298341
"AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART) Abstract Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in one-third of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). Occurrence of IDH is associated with increased resource utilization such as fluid and vasopressor administration, discontinuation of kidney replacement therapy, decreased recovery of kidney function, dependence on kidney replacement therapy and death. IDH is often unrecognized until it is well established, by which time patients are refractory to treatment or have already developed organ injury. Thus, if one could accurately predict who and when patients develop IDH, then effective preemptive treatments could be administered to reduce risk of IDH and improve outcomes. Our preliminary work showed that advanced high-frequency data modeling and waveform analysis identified patients at risk for hypotension within 2 minutes of monitoring in the ICU, and if monitored for 5 minutes, differentiated between patients who would develop hypotension or remain stable over the next 48 hours. In this proposal entitled “Artificial Intelligence Driven Acute Renal Replacement Therapy (AID-ART)”, we propose to apply predictive analytics using linked electronic health record and high-frequency monitor data to critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing intermittent and continuous kidney replacement therapies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic ICUs. We will examine the accuracy of various machine learning models to predict IDH risk-evaluating model performance, usability, alert frequency, lead time and number needed to alert, and hospital mortality and dependence on kidney replacement therapy (Aim 1a); predict response to a range of clinical interventions for IDH and subsequent clinical outcomes (Aim 1b); and perform cross validation across the two healthcare systems (Aim 1c). We will construct reinforcement learning systems to develop a rule-driven intervention for IDH alerts and measurement-driven responses to avoid and respond to IDH based on principles of functional hemodynamic monitoring (Aim 2a). We will also develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal intervention strategy based on the probability of events rather than in reaction to IDH events (Aim 2b). We will silently deploy and evaluate the ability of this artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to forecast IDH risk and recommend interventions in real-time across the two healthcare systems. We will then assess the validity of recommended interventions using an expert clinician adjudication panel (Aim 3a); and will compare the AI recommended interventions with that of actual interventions performed by bedside clinicians (Aim 3b). This proposal will be the harbinger of a future multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine personalized risk prediction and AI-augmented management of IDH among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. Project Narrative Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with dialysis in the intensive care unit, if one could accurately predict early which patients will develop low blood pressure then effective treatments could be given. In this study, we propose to develop and validate an artificial intelligence system that will predict low blood pressure even before they occur and recommend correct treatment to clinicians.",AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART),10371943,R01DK131586,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Performance ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' usability ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,639669
"Improving perioperative management to reduce postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term renal risk Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo intraabdominal surgery procedures. AKI leads to increased risks of adverse outcomes such as hospital readmission and progression to chronic kidney disease, to reduced short- and long-term survival, and to greater costs to both patients and hospital systems. There are no effective treatments to prevent postoperative AKI, and as such, appropriate perioperative management is critical for mitigating its risk. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the ways in which patient and perioperative management factors interact to influence the risk of postoperative AKI. Traditional methods only identify generic, global risk factors and only quantify the average effects of each factor on AKI risk. Using an institutional cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients containing detailed preoperative (e.g., patient demographics, risk factors, comorbidities) and intraoperative data (e.g., hemodynamic variables, medications, fluid management), we will utilize a novel interpretable machine learning framework (SHAP [Shapley Additive exPlanations]) to model postoperative AKI risk. Machine learning provides the ability to model complex relationships among predictor variables, and SHAP quantifies the contribution to AKI risk for each variable in individual patients. We will compare this approach to traditional methods, comparing both predictive performance and the clinical understanding provided by the models. The knowledge gained will support the development and validation of novel, interpretable models in a large, multi-institution cohort and analyses to identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes. SPECIFIC AIMS Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and major cause of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. ADDIN EN.CITE 1 Postoperative AKI is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality ADDIN EN.CITE 2 and increased costs (ranging from $12,100 to $47,700 per patient). ADDIN EN.CITE 3 AKI patients face greater long-term risks of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and associated morbidity and mortality. ADDIN EN.CITE 4 Despite the severe ramifications of postoperative AKI, there are no effective strategies to identify individuals with an elevated risk or inform efforts to prevent its occurrence.5 Optimization of perioperative management may provide the greatest opportunity to fine-tune strategies to minimize AKI risk, as it is a volatile period with an abundance of potential opportunities for intervention. ADDIN EN.CITE 6,7 However, the complex relationships between perioperative factors and the risk of adverse renal outcomes have made it difficult to develop effective tools to guide perioperative patient management towards reducing AKI risk. Traditional risk stratification measures are limited in that they identify global risk factors but do not allow for personalized risk assessment at the level of an individual patient. We propose to use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), ADDIN EN.CITE 8-10 a novel framework that leverages the ability to fit complex models using machine learning approaches while providing interpretable explanations for individual patients.    We have extensive experience characterizing the epidemiology of postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 2,6,11,12 and the development of risk stratification tools for postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 13,14 and other surgical complications. ADDIN EN.CITE 15-21 Through the KL2 award from the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) Irving Institute (CTSA), we assembled a cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients at CUMC, linking extensive electronic health record data to American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data. We found that the addition of detailed intraoperative data improved the risk prediction model for postoperative AKI containing only preoperative data ADDIN EN.CITE 7 and evaluated the ability of machine learning to incorporate preoperative and intraoperative data to predict mortality. The proposed project will utilize our CUMC/ACS NSQIP cohort (N=3834) to refine the development of interpretable machine learning models and demonstrate clinical utility to identify modifiable perioperative factors to reduce postoperative AKI and long-term renal risk. To achieve this, we plan to: Develop and validate personalized risk prediction models for postoperative AKI using interpretable machine learning. We will use both preoperative (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, surgical procedure) and detailed intraoperative data (e.g., fluid types and volumes, medications [e.g., vasopressors], hemodynamic measures [e.g., heart rate, blood pressure]) to develop machine learning models for predicting the development of postoperative AKI, defined by the consensus KDIGO criteria.22 Machine learning provides the ability to fit complex models that account for nonlinear relationships among predictors, and various algorithms will be tested (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, random forest). The SHAP framework quantifies the contribution of each variable to AKI risk (both increases and decreases) for individual patients. We will compare performance to traditional approaches (i.e., parsimonious risk factor model using traditional logistic regression). We hypothesize that the machine learning/SHAP approach will have improved performance and provide a more robust understanding of critical risk factors and the heterogeneity of their effects on AKI risk among patients. This data will serve as the foundation to support the development and validation of novel, interpretable risk prediction models at all stages of the perioperative period (i.e., prior to surgery, during surgery, and immediately after surgery) in a large, multi-institutional cohort at 3 major academic centers. The knowledge gained will identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes.

PROJECT NARRATIVE Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to morbidity – both short- and long-term – and mortality in surgical patients. Perioperative management plays a critical role in determining a patient’s risk of postoperative AKI, but there is an incomplete understanding of the specific ways in which perioperative management influences this risk. This proposal will develop tools to better recognize high-risk patients in real-time during the intraoperative course, to better understand AKI risk factors at an individual level, and identify risk factors for recovery after AKI, a novel paradigm for evaluating the severity of AKI and risk of long-term renal outcomes.",Improving perioperative management to reduce postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term renal risk,10475332,R56DK124325,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Award ', ' Bibliography ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cholecystectomy ', ' gallbladder removal ', ' Historical Cohort Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hepatectomy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infant ', ' Institutes ', ' Intubation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical

"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10271399,K99NS120278,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ligands ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Junction ', ' Myoneural Junction ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sciatic nerve ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sprains and Strains ', ' Standardization ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' mdx mouse ', ' Training ', ' Muscle function ', ' reinnervation ', ' reinnervate ', ' insight ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Muscle Fibers ', ' Myotubes ', ' Rhabdomyocyte ', ' Skeletal Fiber ', ' Skeletal Muscle Cell ', ' Skeletal Muscle Fiber ', ' Skeletal Myocytes ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' myogenesis ', ' success ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Experimental Myasthenia ', ' Experimental Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' B220 ', ' CD45 ', ' GP180 ', ' LY5 ', ' PTPRC ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuromuscular ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' progenitor ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' strain injury ', ' tissue repair ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,88722
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Algorithms ', ' Bleeding time procedure ', ' Bleeding Time ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency Medical Technicians ', ' Emergency Medicine Technicians ', ' Emergency Paramedics ', ' emergency medical personnel ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Special Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Time Management ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' blood product ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' Practice Management ', ' Devices ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' injured ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Trauma ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' user centered design ', ' engineering design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' standardized care ', ' data registry ', ' trauma care ', ' Patient Triage ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Data Science ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' stroke patient ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the
