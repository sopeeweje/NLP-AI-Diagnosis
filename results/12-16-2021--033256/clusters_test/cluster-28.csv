"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing data will determine which of the candidates is a true microRNA by detecting the ~22-nucleotide mature product.",Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo.,10210415,R21GM138951,"['Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Northern Blotting ', ' Northern Blottings ', ' RNA blot analysis ', ' RNA blot hybridization ', ' RNA blotting ', ' northern hybridization ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Plant Viruses ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Ribonuclease III ', ' Nuclear RNase III Drosha ', ' RNase D ', ' RNase III ', ' RNase O ', ' Ribonuclease D ', ' p241 ', ' base ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' synergism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' Sampling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Gene Down-Regulation ', ' Transcription Repression ', ' Transcriptional Repression ', ' gene repression ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Small RNA ', ' Data ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' post-transcriptional gene regulation ', ' posttranscriptional control ', ' posttranscriptional regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Repression ', ' Translational Inhibition ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' deep sequencing ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic predictors ', ' Injections ', ' in silico ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,207132
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,10238766,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' prognostic assays ', ' prognostic test ', ' treatment risk ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,378722
"Cell free RNA liquid biopsies ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of this proposal is to verify an RNA liquid biopsy platform and transition it to have specific utility for the study, and non-invasive assessment, of the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) niche. In addition to their reliance of material excreted from dying, diseased cells, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) platforms are limited to primarily detecting changes in somatic genomic sequence, copy number, or methylation status. Many biological and clinical events, such as hematopoiesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, are executed via global changes in transcriptional regulation. My PhD advisor Dr. Daniel Kim and I have established a platform for exRNA liquid biopsy in human blood-plasma that has demonstrated significant diagnostic and monitoring potential in both Pancreatic cancer and COVID-19 patients. I propose to continue this research to complete my PhD by assessing diagnostic performance of the exRNA platform in a new cohort of 60 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with matched controls. Furthermore, I will apply my expertise in exRNA liquid biopsies to assay the transcriptional dynamics of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Currently, bone marrow biopsies or aspirations are used to determine bone marrow health and production. These techniques are costly and require sedation and/or pain relief for the subject and have the potential to lead to long term discomfort, infection, excessive bleeding, and other side-effects. BM aspirations remain a critical diagnostic and monitoring tool for HSC transplant recovery, leukemias and lymphomas, blood cell pathologies, and infections of unknown origin but the primary readout remains identification and counting of cell types. I hypothesize that hematopoietic lineages within the BM secrete exRNA that reflect cell state and identity that can be used in a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy for detailed study of transcription and populations within the BM. I propose to identify exRNA expressed and secreted by HSCs and the remaining hematopoietic lineage in order to develop a platform to deconvolute peripheral blood into constituent hematopoietic cell types without the need for HSC mobilization. NARRATIVE Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize diagnostic procedures by making them more accessible and less invasive due to the use of biofluids like blood rather than tissue samples. During my PhD I have helped develop an RNA liquid biopsy platform that the F99 will enable me to lead a validation for in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. As an NIDDK K00 fellow, I will expand the RNA liquid biopsy platform into a hematological context that will identify extracellular RNA markers of the hematopoietic lineage in- and ex-vivo.",Cell free

"Model-guided design of RNA stabilizing elements for improved coronavirus diagnostics Project Summary Fast, inexpensive, and sensitive methods to detect the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus are instrumental in containing the spread of COVID-19. Currently, nucleic acid testing of respiratory samples using RT-PCR is the primary and most commonly used method for diagnosing patients in the acute phase of the infection. However, this standard approach suffers from the need for special equipment and well-trained personnel and hence has become a bottleneck to meet the urgent demand for large-scale screening. A range of new RNA-based technologies, including toehold switches and CRISPR/Cas systems, are being actively developed with the aim to implement diagnostic tests that are ultra-sensitive, easy to deploy, and make use of enzymes and reagents separate from the traditional PCR pipeline. One common and critical component of these methods is the engineering of RNA molecules to detect target viral sequences. Consequently, their performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity have been significantly hindered by the fast degradation of RNAs caused by the RNases ubiquitous in both clinical sample matrices and as byproducts of biomolecular reagent production. Here we propose to enhance coronavirus diagnostic performance by programming RNase resistance into assay components, in turn increasing RNA stability and enhancing test sensitivity and speed. We will rationally design RNA 5’ UTR sequences and the resulting secondary structures of mRNA, toehold switch RNA, and CRISPR guide RNAs to modulate their resistance to RNase activities and hence quantitatively tune their stability. Results from the proposed forward engineering studies will increase our understanding and control of RNA dynamics and provide a widely applicable strategy to improve coronavirus detection efficiencies of many technologies under development. Impact: A comprehensively studied RNA design scheme to improve RNA stability will be complementary to current technologies under development to give them a boost in performance, and provide underlying design strategies with potential broader applicability, such as overcoming the stability barrier for mRNA-based vaccines. There are three specific aims in this proposal: Aim 1: Characterize and model the role of 5’ secondary structures in fine-tuning mRNA stability; Aim 2: Optimize sensing RNAs for detection of COVID-19; Aim 3: Use dtRNAs to enhance sample and amplified RNA stability for improved diagnostics.

"High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT Project Summary The discovery and characterization of an efficient, ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase (MarathonRT) now makes it possible to develop high-throughput methods for accurate end-to- end sequencing of long RNA transcripts, thereby preserving information content on alternative splicing, editing and modification isoforms while conserving positional linkage information, thereby enabling one to distinguish RNA isoforms in complex mixtures without mapping to a reference genome. This type of technology is essential for deciphering the role of post- transcriptional RNA processing events during control of developmental stage, cell and tissue specificity and regulation of gene expression in higher organisms. It must be sufficiently efficient and accurate to power the long-read sequencing approaches that are used in single- cell RNAseq, particularly when transcript diversification is monitored as a function of time. The first two aims of the proposal are focused on high-throughput detection of RNA modifications (such as 2-O-methyl groups and N7-methyl guanosines). In the first aim, a unique MarathonRT primer extension protocol will be combined with a trained mutational profiling algorithm to recognize the positions and chemical identities of specific RNA modifications, reporting a modification signature that can be recognized at high throughput during long-read sequencing (MRT-ModSeq). In the second aim, MRT-ModSeq will be tested on unknown RNAs, where it will be used to predict sites of modifications on challenging long transcripts and robustness of the predictions will be directly evaluated using mass spectrometry. The second half of the proposal is focused on identification of linked alternative splicing and editing sites on long transcripts within complex cellular mixtures. In aim 3, MarathonRT will be incorporated into a workflow for accurately profiling the relative abundance and processing diversity of the highly complex paralytic (para) gene, which encodes more than 1 million possible processing variants, a subset of which are essential for the voltage-gating of a sodium channel. This sets the stage for Aim 4, in which sensitivity of the workflow must be further optimized and merged with data analysis strategies suitable for time-resolved single cell applications. The resulting method will be tested by monitoring full-length transcriptomic signatures induced by cell stress. Project Narrative Relevance: A single DNA gene produces many different RNA molecules that differ in size and composition, and each of them plays a distinct role in cellular function and the life of an organism.

"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10138028,R01MH123183,"['Accounting ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Small Nuclear RNA ', ' Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA ', ' Small Molecular Weight RNA ', ' snRNA ', ' uRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Peripheral ', ' Microglia ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' cell type ', ' brain tissue ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Population ', ' Bioconductor ', ' oligodendrocyte precursor ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' secondary analysis ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,507442
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

"Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0 (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long- term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NARRATIVE The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can hijack the normal operations of human cells, which makes it especially dangerous. It encodes a set of nonstructural proteins (nsp) to protect its RNA genome from host degradation and immune restriction. Our studies will combine biochemical, structural, cellular, and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions related to RNA modification, host immune restriction, viral growth and pathogenesis, and develop new molecular tools to collectively inform new COVID- 19 treatments and protect ourselves against future coronaviral infections.",Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity

"Robust identification and accurate quantification of RNA transcripts on a system wide scale Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Summary Next-generation, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is by far the most widely used assay for investigating animal transcriptomes, and numerous public RNA-seq data sets have been generated for various biological conditions in multiple species. However, there remain several barriers in using short RNA-seq reads to accurately identify the splicing structures and quantify the abundances of full-length RNA transcripts. In this proposal, we will develop a series of novel statistical and computational methods to improve the robustness of transcript identification and the accuracy of transcript quantification from Illumina RNA-seq data. (Aim 1) We will develop a novel screening method to construct transcript candidates by first detecting sparse splicing structures from multiple RNA-seq data sets for a given biological condition. These transcript candidates will significantly reduce the search space of downstream transcript identification methods and hence improve their precision. (Aim 2) We will develop a robust transcript identification method to identify novel transcripts in a conservative manner from RNA-seq data given existing annotations. Our method will be based on statistical model selection under the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, which will allow users to control the false positive rate of our identified novel transcripts under any given threshold with high probability. (Aim 3) We will develop an accurate transcript quantification method to effectively leverage multiple RNA-seq data sets and to simultaneously assess the data quality based on low-throughput gold standards and cross-data similarities. All of these methods will be first used to study transcripts in mouse macrophage, for which gold standard qPCR and full length cDNA sequences will be generated for training and method validation. The methods will then be more broadly tested in other biological systems where suitable gold standard data is available. Our methods and software will significantly facilitate the use of Illumina RNA-seq data for gene expression studies at the transcript level, increase reproducibility of scientific discoveries from transcriptomic studies, and improve our understanding of gene expression mechanisms in various biological conditions. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Narrative This project will create a set of computational methods to improve the robustness and accuracy of detecting and quantifying RNA molecules from next-generation RNA sequencing data.

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10251944,R01GM123131,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Charge ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influentials ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Literature ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Proteases ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteins ', ' Nicotinic Receptors ', ' Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Ricin ', ' Castor Bean Lectin ', ' RCA 60 ', ' RCA60 ', ' Ricinus Communis Agglutinin II ', ' Ricinus Lectin ', ' Ricinus Toxin ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serine Protease ', ' Serine Endopeptidases ', ' Serine Protein Hydrolases ', ' Serine Proteinases ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Tweens ', ' Universities ', ' HIV Protease ', ' HIV Proteinase ', ' HTLV-III Protease ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' English Language ', ' Electrostatics ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' hydropathy ', ' mutant ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Hydrophobicity ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Resolution ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Validation ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' ']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,257752
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Erythropoiesis ', ' erythroid development ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kinetics ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleases ', ' RNA Nucleases ', ' RNase ', ' Ribonuclease Family Protein ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Small Nuclear RNA ', ' Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA ', ' Small Molecular Weight RNA ', ' snRNA ', ' uRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Metabolic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' snoRNA ', ' Small Nucleolar RNA ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' RNA purification ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Polymerase ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing ', ' DNase-seq ', ' DNaseI-seq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' KDM1A gene ', ' AOF2 ', ' KDM1A ', ' LSD1 ', ' Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 ', ' Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1A ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' hematopoietic differentiation ', ' ']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500
"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches.

"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"Rapid Sample Preparation and Ultrasensitive Detection of COVID-19 in Human Saliva Project Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – is a global pandemic with worldwide cases of over 35 million and a death toll of over 1 million people. In the United States, there are a total of over 7.5 million cases with over 210,000 deaths as of October 2020. The ability to identify COVID-19 infected patients rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively is of paramount importance to control the disease outbreak. The two different types of COVID-19 tests are diagnostic tests and antibody tests. Specifically, the diagnostic tests can only identify active COVID-19 infected patients; the antibody tests can only indicate prior COVID-19 infections but not active cases. These diagnostic tests include quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and rapid antigen tests. In particular, the qRT-PCR is currently the most sensitive method (down to ~100 copies/mL) but can take >12 hours to perform and require trained personnel, specific reagents, and expensive machines. The rapid antigen tests provide results within 30 minutes, but these tests require the samples to contain high virus concentration (i.e., >107 virus particles/mL) leading to increasing chances of false-negative cases. In addition, one common example of the antibody tests is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This test only applies to patients who have already developed the antibodies, which could take several days to weeks. Thus far, no single tests can detect both active and previously COVID-19 infected cases. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a proof-of-concept rapid and ultrasensitive virus-detection platform termed viral-ID, which is capable of simultaneous detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies inside saliva for the identification of both active and previous COVID-19 infections within a single test. Specifically, the viral-ID platform will allow for specific molecular targeting, separation, enrichment, and filtering, all carried out within a single saliva droplet utilizing the nature-inspired coffee ring effect.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' teacher materials ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Nucleic Acid Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' stem ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Structural Protein ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' slug ', ' Exposure to ', ' Reporter ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' WAGR ', ' WT1 ', ' WT1 Gene Product ', ' WT1 Protein ', ' WT33 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model design ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' loss of function ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches.

"AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma PROJECT SUMMARY Drug discovery is a laborious, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking for biopharma. Oncology is especially difficult with new drugs in clinical trials having just 3.4% probability of success. This application addresses significant challenges of traditional drug target discovery in oncology that relies on cell viability or reporter assays which oversimplifies cell state. New advancements in single-cell RNA expression profiling allows us to overcome these challenges by quantitatively mapping transcriptional dependencies in cancer cells and rapidly probing vulnerabilities to reprogram the oncogenic signaling networks. Transcription factors MYCN and MYC are to date non-druggable by small molecules despite being high value cancer drug targets as they are frequently amplified genes and drive poor outcome across the cancer spectrum. Agents that block MYCN indirectly identified from synthetic lethal viability screens have resulted in only modest or short-lived responses in ongoing clinical trials. Algen’s proprietary machine learning platform (AlgenML) identifies targets that block oncogenic transcription addiction on MYCN using single-cell RNA expression of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) gene knockdown. Genome-wide single-cell RNA expression profiling measures 10,000 genes per cell and each high- throughput assay routinely captures 160,000 cells at once. Using CRISPRi gene knockdown libraries and multiplexing the assays, hundreds of genes can be knocked down simultaneously and we single-cell RNA sequence 200 cells per CRISPRi gene knockdown. This makes for an extremely rich data set with over 400 million data points of RNA expression data which AlgenML analyzes. Our drug discovery approach is innovative because, unlike traditional approaches, the AlgenML platform does not identify essential genes that cause cell death, but rather selects drug targets in an unbiased manner whose suppression can reprogram the disease- related transcriptional dependencies. Resulting drugs should be safer and better tolerated. Here, our approach is to optimize AlgenML to monitor and reprogram MYCN transcriptional activity in new genetically defined models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We focus on neuroblastoma because MYCN amplifications are common in the disease, and the genetically defined models allow detection of the precise contribution of MYCN oncogene compared to isogenic controls. In Aim 1, we define MYCN transcriptional signature, nominate target genes, and test target genes in vitro based on their ability to reprogram the MYCN transcriptional dependency. Aim 2 evaluates in vivo efficacy of target inhibition to shrink tumors and extend lifespan in new human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and rodent models of neuroblastoma from UCSF. Our team of investigators at Algen and UCSF has decades of experience in developing RNA signatures to indirectly targeting MYC and MYCN via synthetic lethality. Mature startup Algen Biotechnologies has a vibrant ecosystem of investors, innovators, and grew out of Nobel Laureate Dr. Jennifer Doudna’s lab at UC Berkeley, who has been a scientific advisor since its founding. With Dr. William Weiss at UCSF, we have assembled a powerhouse environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Algen is developing a drug discovery platform to select and test drug targets that block the oncogenic transcriptional effects of non-druggable drivers such as MYCN. MYC and MYCN transcription factors are directly non-druggable by small molecules, despite being high value targets for drug discovery because their amplifications correlate with extremely poor prognosis across the cancer spectrum.

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures PROJECT SUMMARY RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology, all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the first FDA- approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018. Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortunately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions. Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efficient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA- Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identification of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes.

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10384376,R35GM133462,"['Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Microprocessor ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA Processing ', ' BCAR1 ', ' BCAR1 Protein ', ' Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 1 Protein ', ' CKRAS protein ', ' CRK-Associated Substrate ', ' CRKAS ', ' Cas protein ', ' p130 cas protein ', ' p130CAS ', ' BCAR1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tool development ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2021,95644
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global problem due to an alarming increase in the number of individuals with diabetes. The lack of an early diagnostic tool predicting retinal vascular health is a critical barrier to progress. To this end, we have identified circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) as ideal reporter cells, which are most receptive to changes of diabetic milieu and retinopathy. Our preliminary studies suggest that CACs map a distinct RNA signature. We also found that a miRNA, miR-92a, is downregulated explicitly in CACs with DR, and its overexpression in CACs of people with diabetes decreased pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and CD14, emphasizing the importance of CACs for biomarker discovery of retinal vascular health. Our preliminary studies using machine learning models could accurately predict DR providing us a stronger rationale for developing this paradigm for our robust study design. Furthermore, using rodent models, we found a decrease in miR-92a in lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK; mouse equivalent of CACs) parallels with an increase in acellular capillaries, and miR- 92a inhibition in LSKs triggered a stronger inflammatory response. Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal is to study RNA (miRNA and mRNA) and inflammatory signature using a robust sequencing paradigm and differential modeling in individuals with different severities of DR and animal models to gain insights into retinal vascular health. Our central hypothesis is that RNA signature in CACs mirror DR severity, and miR-92a decrease within CACs serves as a candidate biomarker. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: To assess changes in RNA levels in CACs of patients with different severity of DR and validate miR-92a as a candidate biomarker. Aim 2: Determine whether the miR-92a loss in bone marrow cells is associated with the development of DR in rodents. We anticipate that our proposed studies will identify specific mRNA and miRNA changes of DR severity and validate miR-92a as a novel biomarker for retinal vascular health. Overall, our studies will help improve the standard of care of DR individuals by aiding in diagnosis, prognosis and providing mechanistic insights for future therapies. While diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases are rising globally, and newer treatments are emerging, there is a lack of biomarkers reflecting retinal vascular health. We propose that the RNA levels (mRNA and miRNA) and inflammation in circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) will serve as a biomarker of DR. We will perform RNA sequencing of CACs in DR patients and study how a change in miRNA levels leads to retinopathy using rodent models.",miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome.

"Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts Abstract Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data obtained from large patient cohorts can reveal transcriptomic perturbations that are associated with complex disease and facilitate the identification of disease subtypes. This is typically framed as an unsupervised learning task to discover latent structure in a matrix of RNASeq based quantification of gene expression or local splicing variations (LSVs). However, several factors make analysis of such heterogeneous data challenging. First, such datasets are comprised of samples processed at multiple institutions which might employ different sequencing protocols and quality control steps. This introduces confounding factors into the data like inconsistent sample quality or variable cell type proportions which can hinder detection of true biological signal. Second, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in splice factor genes occurring in a subset of the patients may only result in alteration of a subset of coregulated splicing events. Thus, instead of measuring global similarity between samples based on all transcriptomic features, there is a need to efficiently identify “tiles”, defined by a subset of samples and splicing events with abnormal signals. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this task, they fail to overcome many of the computational challenges associated with modeling splicing data and are not well suited to handle missing values. To facilitate analysis of heterogeneous splicing datasets by reducing false positive discoveries and boosting true biological signal, we will first develop a model to correct for the effects of RNA degradation and cell type mixtures. Then in order to efficiently identify AML subtypes characterized by splicing events and account for splicing specific modeling challenges, we propose CHESSBOARD (Characterizing Heterogeneity of Expression and Splicing by Search for Blocks of Abnormalities and Outliers in RNA Datasets), a non- parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised discovery of tiles. We will apply our models to synthetic datasets and show it outperforms several baseline approaches. Next, we will show that it recovers tiles characterized by known and novel splicing aberrations which are reproducible in multiple AML patient cohorts. Finally, we will show that tiles discovered are correlated with drug response to therapeutics, pointing to the translational impact of our findings. Project Narrative: Analysis of RNA-Seq data from large patient cohorts can reveal novel biological signatures that are pivotal to advancing precision medicine, especially for the treatment of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies. However, there is a lack of computational tools to achieve this. This project will develop methods for removing the cofounding factor effects from large heterogeneous splicing datasets and improving subtype identification through multiomics integration to enable such analysis.",Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts,10315802,F31CA265218,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' Pre-B-Cell Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes Project Summary Alternative splicing is a key cellular process whose dysregulation has been implicated broadly across human genetic disease. Dr. Knowles previously developed LeafCutter, a flexible, scalable, annotation-free tool to quantify local patterns of RNA splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. While LeafCutter has been quite widely adopted and we have actively maintained it and addressed issues on github, it remains “early stage” software. We propose software engineering improvements: 1) appropriate packaging using conda with standard build, installation, testing and logging processes, 2) containerization using Docker, 3) standardization of input/output data formats/interfaces, and 4) refactoring to use a standard workflow language. These improvements will allow us to distribute LeafCutter through repositories including PyPI, BioConda, DockStore, and Galaxy. Finally improvements to documentation, testing and version management will make contributions to LeafCutter from the open source community more feasible and easier to integrate. The parent award for the proposed work is U01 AG068880-01 “Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes”, where we are developing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models to better understand the genetic basis of AD. This award makes extensive use of LeafCutter. In Aim 1 we are building DL models of pre- and post- transcriptional regulation: for the latter LeafCutter provides training data for our neural network model of the sequence determinants of RNA splicing in AD-relevant cell types and states. In Aim 2 we connect AD-associated structural variation to functional variation, including RNA splicing variation. In Aim 3, we will build trans-expression QTL networks across thousands of post-mortem brain samples: with the improvements to the LeafCutter ecosystem proposed here we will be able to straightforwardly extend to trans splicing QTL networks. While we and our collaborators are ourselves heavy users of LeafCutter, we will continue to ensure we provide for the needs and use-cases of the broader genomics community. Alternative splicing is an important cellular process where “junk” DNA is removed from the gene before it is translated into protein. When this process is disrupted in some way it can cause disease. Here we propose software engineering improvements to software, LeafCutter, we previously developed to better understand splicing patterns from RNA-seq data.",Learning the Regulatory Code of

"Scalable 3D molecular imaging and data analysis for cell census generation PROJECT SUMMARY This project is a collaboration across two universities and multiple scientific disciplines to develop new scalable 3D molecular imaging and analysis approaches for cell type identification within human brain tissue. We will focus our efforts on the olfactory system, comprising the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB). This system is an ideally confined human model system to build and test a new suite of scalable tools for the generation of a human brain atlas because the connectomics of olfactory sensory neurons to the bulb is dictated by olfactory receptor expression. Our long term goals are to provide the community with new “physics-first” methods that improve scalability, rigor, and 3D measurements for cell census creation and create the first spatial map of connections between the OE and OB. We plan to achieve our goals across two specific aims, carried out in parallel. In our first aim, we will scale up high-resolution, high-speed single objective light-sheet microscopy for 3D imaging of proteins and RNA in the human olfactory bulb. Using linear unmixing, we will image up to 8 proteins. Using iterative amplified RNA-FISH labeling by fluidic exchange, we will initially image 130 RNAs and detail plans to expand the number of RNA. In our second aim, we will develop a Bayesian nonparametric image analysis framework that self-consistently and simultaneously determines the probability associated with all RNA locations, numbers, and identities in the presence of variable autofluorescence and variable readout efficiency. Within the Bayesian paradigm, we propose a new approach to error correction in barcoded fluorescence experiments that significantly reduces the number of rounds required. We will apply these combined fundamental improvements to map full sections of the OB to determine the targeting of glomeruli by olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific olfactory receptors. As olfactory receptors have high homology and sparse expression, both in situ hybridization and in situ sequencing may report a high number of false positives or false negatives. To mitigate potential identification errors, we will evaluate dual-color amplified labeling strategies combined with Bayesian nonparametric analysis that assigns probabilities based on a self-consistent analysis of all image stacks across all colors simultaneously to avoid drawing conclusions based on local assessments of the identity of a bright spot. Combining these methodological advancements, we will generate 3D spatial maps of confidence intervals for cell types and individual olfactory receptors expression across the olfactory system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how the human brain perceives odorants requires mapping the connectivity of the olfactory system. In this proposal, we propose to develop and apply new scalable 3D imaging and analysis methods to determine the location of glomeruli targeted by olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific olfactory receptors, the olfactory bulb connectome.

"Quantitative high-throughput methods for antibody fragment optimization and discovery Abstract Monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments are an important class of therapeutics comprising a $150B industry. However, methods for discovering and optimizing antibodies to have desired affinity are generally laborious laboratory procedures that require months of hands-on research performed by highly skilled personnel (e.g. phage display, hybridoma, single cell). Additionally, the selection of leads to move forward in the therapeutic development pipeline often must be made with limited information that does not necessarily correspond to quantitative binding affinity. To address these challenges, Protillion has commercialized Prot- MaP, a platform for measuring quantitative protein binding across large libraries of 105 to 109 variants on automated instrumentation, with a time-to-result of approximately 2 days. We achieve this by generating immobilized proteins directly on Illumina DNA sequencing flow cells through a process of in-situ transcription and translation. This platform allows for direct, quantitative measurements of fluorescent antigen binding to entire protein libraries at unprecedented scale—a scale that is finally a match for the sparseness of protein function in amino acid mutation space. In our Phase I period, we adapted Prot-MaP to display VHHs (nanobodies) capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) receptor binding domain (RBD) protein. Our multi-step optimization first comprehensively identified “beneficial” mutations, which were then combined into a second combinatorial library. This strategy identified tens of thousands of protein variants with affinity superior to wild type, with the best exhibiting the highest reported binding affinity for a VHH to this target, a 100-fold improvement from the starting point. We also developed a strategy to humanize this nanobody, producing a near-fully-human sequence that maintained high affinity. In Phase II, we will first improve automation and commercial scalability of our instrumentation, and develop deep learning models for library design and selection of therapeutic leads. We will next optimize other SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD-binding nanobodies, as well as nanobodies capable of binding PD-L1, a target relevant to cancer immunotherapy. We will develop a universally applicable pipeline for identifying high-affinity, humanized, clinically-relevant VHH reagents. We will also extend our display capabilities to larger, scFv domains, and carry out scFv affinity optimization against two separate target ligands, including SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD. Finally, we will adapt our methods to display up to 109 distinct protein variants on a NovaSeq sequencing chip, a scale sufficient to identify binders de novo from naïve humanized VHH libraries. The activities outlined in this proposal will enable display multiple types of antibody fragments, optimize affinity and humanize their sequences, and clearly define the landscape of functional protein sequences. The capability of de novo discovery of new binders from untargeted libraries will make the Protillion platform a vertically integrated “one stop shop” allowing both identification of “hits” from untargeted libraries, as well as detailed mutational analysis and optimization of these variants. Project Narrative Antibodies can be potent clinical therapeutics and are rapidly becoming the most important class of drugs, but despite their importance, the process of discovery, optimization, and characterization of new antibody drugs takes weeks or months of laborious, highly-skilled labor with all currently available methods. Protillion has developed an automated platform for rapid, detailed characterization of millions to billions of individual antibody molecules, and demonstrated the use of this platform to optimize a single-domain (VHH) antibody against a COVID-19 target. In this Phase II application, we will (1) extend this platform to work with scFvs, another important and therapeutically relevant type of antibody fragment, and (2) expand the capabilities of the platform beyond optimization of existing molecules, to the discovery of new therapeutic antibodies that can be used to fight diseases such as COVID-19 and cancer.",Quantitative high-throughput methods

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,10249195,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K-562 ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' MALAT1 ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' HepG2 ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' predictive tools ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' RNA metabolism ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,302431
"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease. This proposal aims to mechanistically link genetic variants and RBP effects to splicing outcome to improve interpretation of consortia-level DNA and RNA sequencing data as it relates to phenotypic

"Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails While thousands of genomic loci have been associated with common human disease, translating these disease associations to clinical impact is often limited by lack of appropriate human cell lines and our inability to unambiguously identify orthologous regulatory regions for studies in model organisms. Sequence alignment, the most frequently used method to detect evolutionary conservation of enhancers and promoters, accurately identifies genes and promoters, but often fails to detect many functionally conserved distal enhancers, in spite of the fact that orthologous TFs generally have conserved binding activity. We have developed a machine learning approach to identify the set of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) active in cell-type specific enhancers from epigenomic data using a gapped-kmer features that encompasses all possible TFBS (gkm-SVM), and this classifier can distinguish active enhancers from non-active regions. This DNA sequence based model can accurately predict enhancer activity in massively parallel reporter assays and the impact of variation in regulatory elements associated with human disease (deltaSVM). The central aim of this proposal is to develop a new computational method using the syntenic gapped-kmer composition to detect functionally conserved regulatory elements missed by conventional sequence alignment methods. Previous studies of enhancer evolution across mammals using sequence alignment have reported that promoters are more conserved than enhancers, and that enhancers are evolving rapidly. In contrast, using gapped k-mers, we find that cell-type specific enhancers and promoters in matched ENCODE/Roadmap tissues are equally functionally conserved, and that gapped k-mers can identify conserved enhancers that are undetectable by sequence alignment. We hypothesize that the improvements relative to sequence alignment methods arise because the gapped-kmer feature space is able to detect similarity between rearrangements and variations of TF binding sites which may vary at gapped positions but which retain similar binding affinities. We will develop a method to detect conserved regulatory regions using the gkm-SVM kernel as a metric of sequence conservation and optimize this method by comparing to genome-wide functional data. We will then develop algorithms to detect long range syntenic intervals of similar gapped k-mer composition and generate genome- wide maps of evolutionary conservation. We will validate the predictions with CRISPRi in human and mouse stem cells differentiated to endoderm. We propose to develop methods to use syntenic gapped-kmer sequence composition to generate maps of evolutionarily conserved regulatory regions and validate these predictions in human and mouse. This project will significantly contribute to our understanding of regulatory element constraint and evolution and will significantly enhance our ability use model organisms to study how human genetic variation contributes to common disease.",Using Syntenic Gapped-kmer Composition to Detect Conserved Enhancers where Sequence Alignment Fails,10480233,R56HG012110,"['Algorithms ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' genetic promoter sequence ', ' promoter sequence ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' jun Oncogene ', ' JUN ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Active Sites ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' heuristics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' DPC4 ', ' Deleted in Pancreatic Carcinoma ', ' Drosophila Homolog of Mothers Against Decapentaplegic 4 ', ' MADH4 ', ' SMA- and MAD-Related Protein 4 ', ' SMAD4 ', ' MADH4 gene ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' JV18 ', ' JV18-1 ', ' MADH2 ', ' MADR2 ', ' SMAD2 ', ' MADH2 gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' epigenomics ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' screening ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' SOX17 gene ', ' SOX17 ', ' SRY-Related HMG-Box Gene 17 ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,388975
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806
"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions.

"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of

"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns. Understanding the intronic codes that confer sensitivity to these naturally occurring genetic changes will provide insight into the mechanisms of spliceosome function as well as the biological pathways distorted by spliceosome dysfunction that may present new therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states,10183903,R01GM141544,"['recombinase ', ' RNA Helicase ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protein Splicing ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Splice Acceptor Sites ', "" 3' Splice Site "", ' Genomics ', ' DNA Helicases ', ' DNA Unwinding Proteins ', ' DNA unwinding enzyme ', ' helicase ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' patched protein ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Motor ', ' Mutate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recombinase-mediated cassette exchange ', ' Cre Lox technology ', ' Cre LoxP system ', ' Cre lox recombination system ', ' Cre lox system ', ' Cre recombinase/LoxP technology ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' gene expression variation ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Auxins ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Catalysis ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Poly A ', ' Poly(rA) ', ' polyadenylate ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,323400
"Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing Project Summary Splicing is the process of removing intronic regions from a precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and combining exons into a mature transcript. Alternative splicing results in differential intron removal, producing multiple alternatively spliced isoforms arising from a common precursor mRNA. The dysregulation of splicing is estimated to underlie at least 15% of human diseases, and is likely to contribute to many more. Splice reactions are performed by the spliceosome, an RNA protein complex that is assembled onto precursor mRNA in stages. The final activity of the spliceosome is influenced by a combination of trans-acting spliceosome factors and cis elements within the precursor mRNA. However, factors involved in cis element function, like sequence motifs and RNA structure folds, are not fully understood, and a majority of such elements remain unidentified. This is particularly true for branchpoint selection, an essential early stage of spliceosome assembly within the intron around the catalytic adenosine. Although the branchpoint is loosely recognized as a highly degenerate sequence motif, it influences downstream splice site selection. My first goal is to elucidate the impact of RNA structure on branchpoint selection by focusing on RNA structure-mediated binding by the spliceosome associated SF3B complex. To do so, I will develop RNA secondary structure models for SF3B-dependent precursor RNAs to identify enriched structural motifs. My work will entail the first large-scale derivation of intronic secondary structures, including branchpoint regions, which will aid in better understanding of how RNA structures around cis regulatory elements influence splicing. My second goal is to develop a system to identify cis splicing regulatory elements and rapidly test their functional significance. To identify regulatory elements, I will identify cis features on mRNAs, including protein binding sites, conservation and RNA secondary structure, and use machine learning to discover novel signatures of functionally relevant cis regulatory regions. The functional impact of such sites on alternative splicing will be experimentally tested through use of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that can block or inhibit the regulatory region. I will set up a positive feedback loop where I can predict cis splice regulatory elements and immediately test their impact on splicing with ASOs, incorporating the test results back into the model to improve predictions. This system will lead to accurate prediction of cis regulatory splicing elements within any gene of interest. Accurate identification of cis elements will improve our ability to understand co-regulation of alternative splicing. The long-term vision of my research is to demystify the splicing code by clarifying the role of RNA structure in splicing and developing a powerful system to identify functional cis regulatory splicing elements and test their activity. Project Narrative Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from precursor mRNA to generate productive transcripts but, if performed incorrectly, can lead to aberrant transcripts and many human diseases. The goal of this project is to understand how RNA structure influences recognition of regulatory elements. Ultimately this research strives to identify elements within precursor mRNAs that regulate splicing and develop tools that can modulate splicing in a predictable manner, revealing more about the role of RNA splicing in disease and leading to therapeutics for splicing-related disorders.",Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing,10275711,R35GM142851,"['Adenosine ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exons ', ' Feedback ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Structural Models ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Precursors ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Antisense Oligonucleotides ', ' Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides ', ' Antisense Agent ', ' anti-sense agent ', ' anti-sense oligo ', ' antisense oligo ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Spliceosome Assembly ', ' Spliceosome Assembly Pathway ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NIGMS,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,366211
"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10227951,R01LM013437,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' RT-PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' RNA Processing ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Molecular Diagnosis ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' P01 Program ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' standard of care ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep learning ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' computational pipelines ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,346597
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors.

"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Serology test ', ' serology assay ', ' Specificity ', ' Synthetic Antigens ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Immunology ', ' Custom ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' synthetic peptide ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' technological innovation ', ' Proteome ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' erythema migrans ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' tick-borne ', ' tickborne ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' tick bite ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antigen diagnostic ', ' antigen based diagnostics ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Deoxyribonuclease I ', ' DNA Endonuclease ', ' DNase I ', ' Pancreatic DNase ', ' Thymonuclease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Polymerase I ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase I ', ' RNA Polymerase A ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Nuclear ', ' Performance ', ' established cell line ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Computations ', ' histone modification ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' mRNA Degradation ', ' mRNA Transcript Degradation ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' genomic tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' computational suite ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,10130561,R35GM131845,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Caenorhabditis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Dosage Compensation (Genetics) ', ' Dosage Compensation ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hermaphroditism ', ' Intersexuality ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Meiosis ', ' meiotic ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Mediating ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' dosage ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' autosome ', ' Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' single molecule ', ' condensin ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' sex determination ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' histone demethylase ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,466290
"Analysis and Prediction of Molecular Interactions Abstract Our research focuses on molecular recognition, with the goal of providing methods and software for solving biomedical problems. The primary areas of interest are protein-protein interactions and the ligand binding properties of proteins. We believe that predictive methods will be substantially improved during the next five years due to the increasing amount of information on sequences, structures, and interactions of molecules in the cell, and the unprecedented availability of computing power. To take advantage of these opportunities we will integrate the use of structural templates, co-evolutionary information, and machine learning into classical biophysical methods. Our rigid body protein docking server ClusPro, which has over 15,000 users, will be combined with our new template based server ClusPro TBM. We also add elements of flexible docking, either by remodeling the regions that cause steric conflicts, or by using a neural net for calculating post-minimization energy values without performing the actual minimization. Several tools will be combined for the structural analysis of protein interaction networks, including a novel method of constructing multi-protein complexes based on pre-calculated tables of interaction energies between pairs of proteins. Examples of applications include the design of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) for modulating a target protein by degradation, the prediction of antibody epitopes, and searching for epitope-specific antibodies. To study the ligand binding properties of proteins we focus on binding hot spots, regions of proteins that are major contributors to the binding free energy. Our FTMap server globally samples the surface of target proteins using fragment sized molecular probes and provides reliable hot spot and pharmacophore information. We will improve the scoring function using neural nets, and expand the set of probes to obtain generalized pharmacophores that identify regions in the protein binding site with preferences for specific functional groups and a number of bound fragments. Since this information can be used to find larger ligands, the goal is to convert FTMap into a fragment based ligand discovery platform. We will also improve our template-based server LigTBM, which docks small molecules to proteins, and will integrate template-based modeling with FTMap. In a collaborative application we will analyze metabolite-protein interaction data obtained by precision mass spectrometry in E. coli and human protein pull-down experiments. FTMap will be used to test whether a target protein has a suitable binding hot spot, and LigTBM will place the metabolite. We are particularly interested in finding metabolites that bind at novel allosteric regulatory sites. A related application will be to study ensembles of structures obtained by dynamic simulations to find potential correlations between FTMap derived binding properties at different regions of proteins, thus exploring potential allosteric communication. Narrative Our research focuses on molecular interactions, and we develop methods for protein-protein docking and the characterization of ligand binding properties of proteins. Predictive tools for these applications will be substantially improved by integrating classical biophysical approaches with sequence, structure, and interaction information on biological macromolecules, and by utilizing the unprecedented availability of computer power.

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Adenosine ', ' adenosine deaminase ', ' Adenosine Aminohydrolase ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Atlases ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Breast ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Codon Nucleotides ', ' Codon ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exons ', ' Guanosine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inosine ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Permeability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Lung Adenocarcinoma ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' RNA Editing ', ' RNA, Messenger, Editing ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Poly(A) Tail ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' success ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' RT-PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Processing ', ' Polymerase ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' functional outcomes ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' cost effective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613
