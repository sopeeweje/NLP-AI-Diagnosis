"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",10226996,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' nitrate ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Sulfate ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cohort ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,725749
"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Award ', ' Benzene ', ' Benzol ', ' Benzole ', ' Cyclohexatriene ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Gasoline ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' leukemia ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Work ', ' 1,3-Butadiene ', ' divinyl ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' environmental agent ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' health application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' health data ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' Data Science ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Child Health ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common pregnancy complication and are associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is also the leading cause of death for women in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP. However, several limitations exist, including 1) the ignorance of residential mobility during pregnancy in exposure assessments, 2) the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, and 3) the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome). While HDP have been linked to long-term CVD risk after pregnancy, limited data are available on early maternal CVD risk (within the first five years after delivery) complicated by HDP. More importantly, no study has focused on the impact of environmental exposures during and after pregnancy on maternal CVD risk after pregnancy. In addition, risk assessment models of HDP predominantly rely on biomarkers that are not ubiquitously tested among all pregnant women, and no predictive model has been developed to identify women at higher CVD risk after pregnancy. This study builds on our prior work in the external exposome and leverages our access to the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium to address multiple challenges in the field by: 1) determining the association between pregnancy external exposome and risk of HDP, considering the subtype, onset, and severity of HDP and accounting for pregnancy residential mobility in exposure measurements; 2) assessing early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy associated with HDP and the external exposome, and 3) developing predictive models of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy. This research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, guided experiential and clinical learning, seminars, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of environmental impacts on cardiovascular health among pregnant and postpartum women. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in cardiovascular health, omics and exposome research, biomedical informatics and data science, and professional skills. My short-term career goals include completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the third year of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, collaborative, and productive epidemiologist and health data scientist leading research programs in cardiovascular health, with a focus on its intersection with perinatal and environmental epidemiology using big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a major cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) after pregnancy. However, multiple challenges and knowledge gaps exist in previous studies such as the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome), and limited understandings on how environmental exposures during pregnancy may impact subsequent maternal CVD risk after delivery. Leveraging the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from OneFlorida, this study builds on our prior work in the external exposome, aiming to examine the associations between the external exposome and risk of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy as well as to develop predictive models of HDP and maternal CVD after pregnancy to guide precision preventions.",Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome,10214088,K01HL153797,"['Accounting ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Award ', ' Birth Records ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Eclampsia ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Five-Year Plans ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' Gestational Hypertension ', ' Hypertension induced by pregnancy ', ' Hypertension-Associated Pregnancy Disorder ', ' Pregnancy Associated Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease of pregnancy ', ' pregnancy hypertension ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' hypertensive factor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Perinatal Epidemiology ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' infant morbidity/mortality ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' health data ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' informal learning ', ' informal education ', ' informal instruction ', ' science teacher ', ' science educator ', ' science professional ', ' Data Science ', ' data resource ', ' deep learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' maternal risk ', ' digital repositories ', ' electronic repositories ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,33125
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hurricane ', ' indexing ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Pesticides ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Water Purification ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' water treatment ', ' contaminant transport ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' superfund chemical ', ' superfund site ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' remediation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Superfund ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' contaminated water ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' community involvement ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' extreme weather ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,10132972,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Vibrio cholerae infection ', ' Infection with V cholerae ', ' Infection with V. cholerae ', ' Infection with Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae infection ', ' V. cholerae infection ', ' cholera infection ', ' infected with cholera ', ' infection with cholera ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' lateral flow assay ', ' lateral flow test ', ' serosurveillance ', ' serology surveillance ', ' serosurvey ', ' serology survey ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,663407
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,10149408,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' markov model ', ' process repeatability ', ' process reproducibility ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' structured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,501430
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arsenic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood -

"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10165832,K01MH121580,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' prophylactic ', ' cell type ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Early identification ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' high risk ', ' biosignature ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' methylome ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' methylomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2021,174843
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and

"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population Project Summary / Abstract Droughts are an important natural disaster but the health implications for elderly populations in the United States have not been extensively studied. This study seeks to provide evidence on the cardiometabolic health risks posed by drought. Droughts can contribute to groundwater over-pumping, and this may in turn lead to arsenic release from aquifer clays into drinking water sources. The impacts of drought on arsenic exposure and resultant health outcomes in human populations are potentially important and this study seeks to address that knowledge gap. We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study, as well as hydrogeological measurements of water and environmental conditions in the San Luis Valley, to clarify relationships between drought, arsenic in water, arsenic exposure (as measured by urine biomarker), and cardiometabolic health outcomes including incident diabetes (DM), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. This work is community-engaged and includes a K12 outreach component. Aim 1 quantifies the relationship of drought to individual arsenic exposures and thence to incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality. Aim 2 generates a model for groundwater arsenic as a function of hydrological predictors using machine learning approaches, and uses this to explore relationships between drought, modeled water arsenic and the outcomes of Aim 1. Aim 3 estimates the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality, using a nested case-control design and predictions over time of arsenic exposure from the Aim 2 model. Aim 4 is a simulation study projecting future CVD and DM outcomes under different scenarios of drought conditions, with and without counterfactual interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic.

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10457534,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,61042
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes. This study will provide new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. These findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals in the population, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.",Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes,10117729,R01ES031591,"['Arachidonic Acids ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' P450 ', ' Eicosanoids ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Joints ', ' Lipoxygenase ', ' Linoleate-Oxygen Oxidoreductase ', ' Lipoxidase ', ' carotene oxidase ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' oxidation ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase ', ' Arachidonic Acid Cyclooxygenase ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase ', ' Cyclooxygenase ', ' Fatty Acid Cyclo-Oxygenase ', ' Hydroperoxide Cyclase ', ' PGH Synthase ', ' PGH2 Synthetase ', ' Prostaglandin Cyclo-Oxygenase ', ' Prostaglandin Cyclooxygenase ', ' Prostaglandin Endoperoxide Synthetase ', ' Prostaglandin G-H Synthase ', ' Prostaglandin H Synthase ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthetase ', ' Prostaglandin Synthase ', ' Prostaglandin Synthetase ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' environmental agent ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Live Birth ', ' Outcome Study ', ' human data ', ' toxicant ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' economic cost ', ' intra-uterine growth ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' reproductive ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Isoprostanes ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' environmental chemical ', ' environmental chemical exposure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' 37 weeks gestation ', ' 37 weeks completed gestation ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,632023
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death

"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10250551,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disasters ', ' Earthquakes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Indonesia ', ' East Indies ', ' Malay Archipelago ', ' Netherlands East Indies ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Science ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Siblings ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' acetone hydrazone ', ' AceH ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Public Domains ', ' Imagery ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sumatra ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Indian Ocean ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Height ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Emotional ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' environmental change ', ' human capital ', ' reconstruction ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Tsunami ', ' weather patterns ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' population health ', ' cognitive performance ', ' sea level rise ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' data resource ', ' Child Health ', ' adverse childhood events ', ' adverse childhood experiences ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,498320
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,10224154,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,689816
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: Aprospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents.

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions.

"Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-P. aeruginosa) contributes to significant mortality in hospitalized patients. Only four β-lactam agents with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa are available in the US, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently used to treat CR-P. aeruginosa. Pre-clinical investigations indicate C-T had activity against >90% of P. aeruginosa isolates; after clinical use, reports of P. aeruginosa that initially tested susceptible to C-T but became resistant during therapy emerged. Our preliminary data indicate that amongst 28 consecutive patients infected with CR-P. aeruginosa with isolates initially susceptible to C-T, 50% of patients had subsequent P. aeruginosa isolates with > 4-fold increase in C-T minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to 30 days after C-T exposure. We identified genetic markers contributing to resistance through whole genome sequencing (WGS) – notably mutations in the ampC-ampR region and in PBP3. Alarmingly, 86% of P. aeruginosa isolates initially susceptible to another novel antibiotic, ceftazidime-avibactam (C-A), exhibited resistance to C-A after C-T exposure - in the absence of C-A exposure. This is concerning as the emergence of resistance to one novel agent could eliminate the few remaining treatment options. We explored modifiable risk factors that could reduce the frequency of C-T resistance and found that 30% of patients who received C-T over 1 hour had subsequent C-T resistant isolates, whereas no patients who received the drug over 3 hours developed resistant isolates. We would like to repeat this exploratory work and include experimental validation studies in a cohort of 260 patients across seven hospitals who have paired P. aeruginosa clinical isolates stored at -80°C and were prescribed C-T. In Aim 1, WGS will identify the genetic loci associated with C-T resistance comparing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates from the same patient before and up to 30 days after C-T exposure. Validation will occur through cloning and site-directed mutagenesis work. Broth microdilution will determine susceptibility testing results for the three other β-lactams with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa to quantify the emergence of cross-resistance. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on diverse C-T administration strategies at participating sites and develop a machine learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians how to prescribe C-T most effectively to reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance. The following are some risk factors that will be investigated for potential inclusion: (1) infusion of C-T over 3 hours, (2) high-dose C-T, (3) combination antibiotic therapy, (4) dialysis dependency, (5) source of infection and source control, (6) number of days of C-T exposure. This work will (1) inform future drug development by identifying areas of the bacterial chromosome highly prone to resistance and in need of additional reinforcement and (2) identify modifiable risk factors that can be used by clinicians to enable novel antibiotics to remain effective treatment options for extended periods of time. Project Narrative Only four β-lactam antibiotics with activity against carbapenem-resistant-P. aeruginosa are available in the United States, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently prescribed. Our preliminary data indicate that high-level resistance of CR-P. aeruginosa to C-T can occur shortly after clinical exposure to this agent. Using a cohort of 260 patients contributing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates before and after C-T exposure, we propose to: (1) identify and experimentally validate genetic markers leading to C-T resistance; (2) determine the frequency with which C-T resistance leads to cross-resistance to the three other β-lactam agents with activity against C-T; and (3) develop a machine-learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians of modifiable risk factors that could slow the emergence of resistance to C-T.",Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10301838,R21AI153580,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Combined Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Combinations ', ' Antibiotic Drug Combinations ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Ceftazidime ', ' Bacterial Chromosomes ', ' Cloning ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Hospitals ', ' Imipenem ', ' Imipemide ', ' N-Formimidoylthienamycin ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Monobactams ', ' Lactam Antibiotics ', ' Monobactam Antibiotics ', ' Monocyclic beta-Lactams ', ' beta lactam antibiotic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Tazobactam ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Regrets ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Case Series ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' Exposure to ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Test Result ', ' respiratory ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' drug development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' genome sequencing ', ' VDAC1 ', ' pore forming protein ', ' porin ', ' VDAC1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' combat ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' carbapenem resistance ', ' carbapenem resistant ', ' resistance to carbapenem ', ' resistant to carbapenem ', ' clinical investigation ', ' individual patient ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ', ' P. aeruginosa infection ', ' infected with P. aeruginosa ', ' infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,275758
"Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence. In utero exposure to environmental chemicals can disturb neurobehavioral development in both animals and in humans. The pathways linking in utero environmental exposures to neurobehavioral development likely involve exposure-induced changes in the function of neural circuits that support cognitive control and reward processes. We hypothesize that changes in the function of these circuits may act as a pathway between environmental exposure and a range of maladaptive behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Such behavioral symptoms include attention problems, substance abuse, and psychotic experiences. This study will: 1) apply novel pattern recognition approaches to identify specific exposure profiles of complex high-dimensional mixtures of prenatal chemical and social exposures and examine how these profiles explain variation in risk for these behavioral symptoms in adolescence; 2) use task and resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to identify how distinct exposure profiles affect circuits that support cognitive control and reinforcement learning; and 3) explore if exposure-induced changes in brain activation and connectivity mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Impact: This R01 will integrate advanced pattern recognition methods, a cognitive neuroscience approach and state-of-the-art fMRI techniques to explore brain pathways through which prenatal exposures alter behavior later in adolescence. We will explore circuit-based changes in brain function that may mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and symptoms of psychiatric disorders that typically emerge and co-occur in adolescence. By simultaneously studying mixtures of chemical and social stressors as well as profiles of co- occurring symptoms, we will greatly enhance our ability to comprehensively characterize the complex impacts of prenatal environmental exposures on behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools. Pregnant women and their fetuses are exposed to multiple environmental insults during gestation, a very influential period for the fetal developing brain; prenatal exposures have been linked to increased cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems including self-regulation, attention, conduct, and substance use problems, and psychotic experiences. Using a cognitive neuroscience approach, we seek to understand how in utero exposure to complex environmental mixtures alters the function of brain circuits that support cognitive control and reward processing, and gives rise to a range of behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our findings will allow public health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel circuit-specific intervention tools.","Prenatal Environmental Mixtures, Cognitive Control and Reward Processes, And Risk for Psychiatric Problems in Adolescence.",10303872,R01ES032296,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Fetus ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Influentials ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' trait ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to estimate the effect of community water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes in California and identify whether there are subpopulations who are especially vulnerable to fluoride exposure during pregnancy. Fluoride has been added to water supplies to promote dental health in the United States since 1945, but the impacts on pregnancy outcomes have never been assessed. It is possible that maternal and in-utero fetal exposure to fluoride increases risk of preterm birth and small-for- gestational age. A small number of studies in other countries suggest there is an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes associated with drinking water with naturally high levels of fluoride, and evidence suggests fluoride consumption can affect thyroid function and cardiovascular systems, both of which play important roles in regulating and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Since 1995, California has required water systems with at least 10,000 service connections to fluoridate their water, but systems were only required to implement a fluoridation program once the funds were allocated. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of variability in which water systems have added fluoride over the last 25 years, and when they did so. We will leverage this variation in water fluoridation practices in California to (1) identify the effects of changes in water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes during 2006-2017 and (2) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous exposure effects by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. Furthermore, we will use the ECHO.CA.IL pregnancy cohort, which is composed of pregnant women and their children in San Francisco and Illinois, to (3a) assess whether maternal urinary fluoride during the second trimester is associated with reduced gestational age or lower birthweight-for-gestational-age-z-scores at birth and (3b) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous effects of exposure by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. The research plan is bolstered by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of San Francisco, California. The proposed project builds on the applicant’s background in perinatal epidemiology and provides training in new statistical methods to identify heterogeneous exposure effects and education in the biological processes of gestation and parturition, exposure assessment of environmental chemicals, and translating scientific findings to policymakers. The combined research and training plans will enable the candidate to transition into an independent researcher of policy-relevant social and environmental factors that shape perinatal health. This research aligns with NIEHS’s strategic goals to evaluate health effects of the exposome, identify individual susceptibilities to environmental hazards, utilize data science techniques, and generate evidence that can be utilized by policymakers to improve population health. Project Narrative Community water fluoridation may affect perinatal health outcomes, but this has never been evaluated in the United States. It is critical to understand how this widespread practice affects the health of mothers and infants, and whether subgroups of the population are uniquely vulnerable. This project will provide critical information to assist public health officials in making informed decisions about the ongoing practice of adding fluoride to water supplies in the United States.",Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes,10284698,K99ES033274,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Award ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition

This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites. We use custom and proprietary techniques combined with BigData software to generate historical exposure (“exposome”) profiles as well provide Decision Support Tools services for CHAB monitoring in near-real time. During Phase 2 and beyond we work with world experts to integrate our commercial products and services into neurodegenerative disease Gene-Environment (GxE) risk assessment frameworks. Proposed Products, Services, Outcomes  • Develop historical CHAB exposure measurements working with environmental agency partners  • Assessment of CyanoHABs as a risk factor for ALS across multiple, independent study regions  • CHABMAP on-demand Analytics-as-a-Service platform operating at end of Phase 2  • Support discovery of etiology and drug development for neurological disorders and diseases Project Narrative Design, build, and operate a cloud-based Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analysis Platform (CHAB-MAP) for developing public health applications’ in partnership with NASA, EPA, and medical centers.

"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination. PROJECT NARRATIVE Contaminated soils and waters continue to threaten public health and safety.

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,10065493,R01AI148336,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Droughts ', ' Dust ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Meningitis ', ' Meteorology ', ' Methods ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Public Health ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Soil ', ' Reproduction spores ', ' Spores ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' environmental intervention ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' Lung infections ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' infection risk ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' infection rate ', ' rate of infection ', ' Climatology ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,838232
"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW.

"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10263210,R01ES032140,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Carbon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Europe ', ' Health ', ' Personal Health Records ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Meteorology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nickel ', ' Ni element ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' nitrate ', ' North America ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urbanization ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' indoor air contamination ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pollution ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Sulfate ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' years of life lost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' effective intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' study population ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' ']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,547223
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology Parent award: OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops.

"Leveraging Computer Vision to Augment Suicide Risk Prediction Abstract Self-injurious behaviors occur at alarmingly high rates among adolescents, with suicide ranking as the second leading cause of death among those ages 15-24. A history of prior self-injury, including both nonsuicidal self- injury and suicidal self-injury (e.g., suicide attempts), has been consistently found to be the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior, with evidence suggesting that the more severe such behaviors are, the greater the risk for future self-injury. Importantly, however, our current means of assessing severity of prior self-injury is almost entirely reliant on self-report, despite the fact that self-injury frequently leaves tangible physical markings. Although applications of machine learning in medical image analysis are growing exponentially, none have attempted to augment suicide risk detection through automated analysis of self-directed tissue damage. Leveraging computer vision to automatically assess images of tissue damage has the potential to obviate complete reliance on subjective patient report of self-injury severity characteristics. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to utilize computer vision techniques to automate the assessment of hypothesized self-injury visual severity indicators, learn new visual severity indicators, and determine the utility of these visual signals in predicting prospective suicide attempt risk. Community adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old will be recruited on Facebook and Instagram if they have currently visible physical marking(s) secondary to self-injury. Participants will securely upload images of markings secondary to intentional self-injury. A subset of participants will be followed longitudinally for three months to assess prospective suicide attempts. We will employ deep convolutional neural networks, a class of artificial neural networks, to develop algorithms to detect severity indices of self-injury and to examine their accuracy in predicting short-term prospective suicide risk. We will assess the generalizability of a subset of algorithms by applying them to a separate clinical sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old. This proof-of-concept study will set the stage to determine the feasibility of pursuing our long-term goal of integrating this technology into psychiatric care entry-points (e.g., emergency departments, inpatient units) to assess whether this technology can augment current suicide risk assessment models and in turn, serve as a clinical decision-support tool to help clinicians assess suicide risk. This research is significant in that it aligns with the NIMH/National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention’s Aspirational Goal 2 of determining suicide risk in diverse populations and settings using feasible and effective assessment approaches, and Goal 3 of finding novel ways to assess for imminent suicide risk, given that our target prediction period is three months. Project Narrative This application aims to determine whether a computer can analyze pictures of skin damage from adolescents who engage in self-injury and predict who is at risk for making a suicide attempt in the future. Results from this work may help in the development of a clinical decision-support tool to help clinicians assess suicide risk in medical care settings.",Leveraging Computer Vision to Augment Suicide Risk Prediction,10285809,R21MH127231,"['Hospitalized Adolescent ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mole the mammal ', ' Moles ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' suicidal individual ', ' high risk ', ' non-suicidal self injury ', ' nonsuicidal self injury ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' support tools ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' recruit ', ' clinical decision support ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Facebook ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' automated analysis ', ' infection risk ', ' skin damage ', ' cutaneous damage ', ' dermal damage ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,265545
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of

"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Folic Acid ', ' Folate ', ' Pteroylglutamic Acid ', ' Vitamin M ', ' vitamin Bc ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylmercury Compounds ', ' Methyl Mercury Compounds ', ' methylmercury ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' Measures ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' in utero ', ' cost ', ' prenatal environmental exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Child Neurotoxicity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' cognitive ability ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker development ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neurodevelopmental effect ', ' neurodevelopment effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and

"Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention ABSTRACT. Decades of research to improve the prevention and early detection of suicide risk has largely resulted in the detection of who is most likely to consider suicide, but not when or if that is most likely to happen. Most detection methods presume patients are in contact with the healthcare system, which only reaches a proportion of the at-risk population. Many people at high risk for suicide do not seek professional help because of lack of time, stigma, and fear regarding how they will be treated in the health care system. It is imperative that we develop methods that can identify proximal risk for suicide that does not depend on system- level contact. Web-based search tools are ubiquitous, with 46% of the global population using the internet for information searches and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that this online search-engine behavior may prove to be an effective, private, and immediate method of proximal risk detection of suicide for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. We will recruit 1,000 people with mental illness with varying risk for suicide. Participants will provide us access to Google Take-Out (GTO) data, which includes search-engine history and behavior including YouTube. Participants will include those who have report a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250). All will participate using gold-standard suicide behavior research instruments. Using a case-crossover design, we will evaluate the intermittent exposures (search based proximal risk factors) with an immediate and transient effect on risk and an abrupt outcome (suicide attempt). The case-crossover design is a well-tested and proven approach especially in cases where transient events can trigger acute events such as cardiovascular events, injuries, and death due to environmental exposures and has been studied with interview data to determine warning signs for suicide attempts. Further for predicting suicidal attempt/s, we will use robust ensemble-based machine learning methods such as random forest, gradient boosting to evaluate the predictive nature of qualitative and quantitative features. The study will conclude in a collaborative dissemination planning process with our community partners. Thus, this retrospective and prospective study that aligns GTO data with carefully assessed suicidal thoughts and behaviors has the potential to identify warning signs in search and YouTube data that predict when suicidal risk and lay the groundwork for innovative pathways to suicide prevention. Narrative. Online search-engine behavior (Google and YouTube) may be an effective, private, and immediate method of suicide risk detection for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. In this study, participants who made a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt but over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250) will complete gold- standard research assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior and provide Google Take-Out Search and YouTube data. Using a case-crossover design, we will identify and evaluate proximal risk factors in search- engine behavior; that is, patterns that change at the time of suicidal behavior or increases in suicidal ideation and lay the groundwork for ethical, feasible, and acceptable online interventions that can be deployed immediately when suicide risk is high.",Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention,10207109,R01MH123484,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Privatization ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' information seeking behavior ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' digital ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' social media ', ' predictive tools ', ' search engine ', ' prognostic signature ', ' prognostic profile ', ' recruit ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' online intervention ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,876668
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. In this project, we plan to improve the identification of patients at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, by linking mortality data with electronic health records data and using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence such as deep learning.

"Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients. PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT). PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid misuse and its associated risks of suicide is a national public health emergency. Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data. The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT).",Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients.,10233949,R01MH121907,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Firearms ', ' Florida ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Services Administration ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' chronic pain ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Homelessness ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicide rate ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' Medicare claim ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' electronic structure ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' risk mitigation ', ' public health emergency ', ' social health determinants ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' care fragmentation ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' overdose risk ', ' data warehouse ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' community clinic ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' provider factors ', ' clinician factors ', ' clinician-level factors ', ' physician factors ', ' physician-level factors ', ' provider-level factors ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,707472
"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10239191,R01MH123489,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Population Control ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' data resource ', ' early life stress ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,688954
"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"The External Exposome and COVID-19 Severity among Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with severe consequences. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at a higher risk of contracting COVID- 19 and experiencing severe COVID-19. However, risk factors for COVID-19 severity among individuals with ADRD beyond older age and comorbidities remain largely undefined, and the ability to predict COVID-19 severity among ADRD patients is limited. There are large overlaps between the currently known risk factors of severe COVID-19 and the health conditions that are affected by environmental exposures, and emerging evidence suggested that long-term environmental exposures may be important determinants of COVID-19 severity. Our current R21 (1R21ES032762) was set to identify novel environmental exposures associated with COVID-19 severity considering the totality of the external environment (or the external exposome). Compared with the general population, individuals with ADRD are substantially different in their individual characteristics and environmental exposure profiles. Therefore, a more focused study on the relationships between environmental exposures and COVID-19 severity among ADRD individuals is needed. The rise of real-world data (RWD) creates the perfect opportunity to create a synthetic COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD at the scale needed to understand the full-spectrum of COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with ADRD. Nevertheless, there are two key barriers: (1) the lack of a consensus on methods for examining the external exposome-health associations, and (2) the lack of a pipeline to accurately identify ADRD patients from RWD and extract important risk factors that are only available in unstructured clinical notes. Expanding our parent award on the external exposome and COVID-19 severity to focus on individuals with ADRD, we aim to fill these important gaps to: (1) create a synthetic longitudinal COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD, (2) systematically evaluate statistical methods for external exposome-wide association study (ExWAS), specifically for COVID-19 outcomes among ADRD patients, and (3) through an external ExWAS, identify external exposome factors associated with COVID-19 severity and then develop predictive models of COVID-19 severity among individuals with ADRD. This study builds upon our continuous work on the external exposome and OneFlorida – a repository of RWD with linked electronic health records, claims, and vital statistics data that covers > 60% of Floridians. This study will generate: (1) a large longitudinal COVID-19 cohort of individuals with ADRD, (2) standardized state-of-the-art statistical methods to conduct external ExWAS, and (3) novel external exposome factors associated with COVID-19 severity and predictive models of ADRD patients at high- risk of severe COVID-19. Our approach can be scaled up through PCORnet to create a national cohort and expanded to examine COVID-19’s long-term effects among individuals with ADRD in future studies.

"Development and clinical interpretation of machine learning emergency department suicide prediction algorithms using electronic health records and claims Project Summary  Preventing suicide is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care system. People who seek emergency care for mental health complaints are at high short-term risk of non-fatal suicide events and suicide. Yet identifying high-risk patients is challenging as risk fluctuates in a poorly understood manner. It is especially difficult to evaluate risk in emergency settings, where access to the patient's mental health history is often limited. The proposed project seeks to address this critical knowledge gap by pairing data mining and machine learning methods with rich data sources in order to develop short-term prediction models of non-fatal suicidal events and suicide for patients presenting to EDs with mental health problems.  The specific aims of this study are to 1) apply advanced machine learning data analytic techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a clinically rich description of ED mental health patient characteristics that predict suicide and non-fatal suicidal events over a 90- day follow-up period; 2) use longitudinal and temporal features of EHR and claims data from the 180 days preceding the ED mental health visit to generate clinically interpretable suicide and suicidal event risk scores; and 3) convene ED physicians to enhance model development, clinical interpretability, and utility of a suicide risk assessment clinical decision support tool.  We will achieve these aims by leveraging several different sophisticated machine learning analytic methods of existing longitudinal clinical and service use information. We seek to develop point-in-time, short-term risk scores for suicidal symptoms and suicide death and the clinical features that drive that risk that may be used to inform clinical risk assessment and management of patients who present to EDs with mental health complaints. Risk algorithms will be developed and validated using health information from a large combined EHR and claims dataset with over 24 million commercially insured patients, which is linked to the National Death Index. Findings will yield new insights regarding patient-specific risk factors and potential targets for intervention. By drawing on data sources common to most health care systems and using efficient computer algorithms this approach has the potential to develop clinically interpretable suicide risk scores at the point of ED evaluation and following disposition. This will help front- line clinicians focus their efforts on high risk patients during high risk periods to inform intervention decisions about suicide risk. Project Narrative Although patients with mental disorders who present to emergency departments have over a 30-fold increased odds of suicide, most are not identified as at risk during these visits. This project will apply machine learning methods to electronic health records and medical claims in order to develop and evaluate point-in-time short- term longitudinal suicide risk algorithms for patients presenting to the emergency department with mental health complaints.

"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Social Processes ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Self-Direction ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10162467,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PHS II ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' safety outcomes ', ' cardiovascular effects ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,561787
"Data science tools to identify robust exposure-phenotype associations for precision medicine Project Summary/Abstract Phenotypic variability across demographically diverse populations are driven by environmental factors. The overall goal of this proposal is to deploy data science approaches to drive discovery of associations between exposures (E) and phenotypes (P) in demographically diverse populations. We lack data science methods to associate, replicate, and prioritize exposure variables of the exposome (E) in phenotypes (P) and disease incidence (D), required for the delivery of precision medicine. Observational studies are fraught with 4 unsolved data science challenges. First, E-based studies are: (1) limited to associating a few hypothesized exposure- phenotype pairs (E-P) at a time, leading to a fragmented literature of environmental associations. Machine learning (ML) approaches for feature selection and prediction hold promise, however, (2) most extant E-based cohorts contain missing data, challenging the use of ML to detect complex E-P associations, Third, (3) biases, such as confounding and study design influence associations and hinder translation. Fourth, (4) there are few well-powered data resources that systematically document longitudinal E-P and E-D associations across massive precision medicine. It is a challenge to systematically associate a number of exposures in multiple phenotypes and replicate these associations across cohorts. (Aim 1). The “vibration of effects”, or the degree to which associations change as a function of study design (e.g., analytic method, sample size) and model choice is a hidden bias in observational studies (Aim 2). Third, an outstanding question is the degree to which environmental differences lead to health disparities. To address these challenges and gaps, we propose to Aim 1: develop and test machine learning methods to associate multiple environmental exposure indicators with multiple phenotypes: EP-WAS. We hypothesize that exposures will explain a significant amount of variation in phenotype in populations and will deposit all data and models in a novel EP-WAS Catalog. Aim 2: Quantitate how study design influences associations between exposure biomarkers and phenotype. We will scale up, extend, and test a method called “vibration of effects” (VoE) to measure how study criteria influences the stability of associations (how reproducible associations are as a function of analytic choice). Aim 3. Leverage EP-WAS and VoE to disentangle biological, demographic, and environmental influences of phenotypic disparities in hypercholesterolemia. We will deploy EP-WAS and VoE packaged libraries in the largest cohort study to partition phenotypic variation across demographic groups in factors for hypercholesterolemia. We will equip the biomedical community with data science approaches for robust data-driven discovery and interpretation of exposure-phenotype factors in observational datasets, required for the identification of environmental health disparities. For the first time, investigators will ascertain the collective role of the environment in heart disease at scale just in time for the All of Us program. Project Narrative Massive observational cohorts with the exposome (ie, multiple environmental factors) and phenome (disease risk factors) are being assembled by countries worldwide. We will equip the biomedical community with data science and machine learning tools for robust data-driven imputation, discovery, interpretation, and re-use of complex exposure-phenotype associations that emerge from big data.

"The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people age 14–24, and rates in this age group are increasing. Most suicide risk factors are distal (i.e., long-standing, static), thus informative regarding who is at risk, but not when. As such, our ability to reliably predict near-term suicide risk among vulnerable populations remains grossly inadequate. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between subjective sleep disturbances and the continuum of suicidality. Yet, sleep is a complex behavior that can be measured along multiple dimensions and at varying levels of analysis. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of normative biological and psychosocial developmental processes that further contribute to dynamic changes in risk related to sleep disturbance. Such changes in sleep are particularly dramatic during adolescence. Studies also have not examined how sleep interacts with other known pathways, such as dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, to lead to suicidality in vulnerable youth. We thus propose to conduct an 8-week prospective multi-method study of sleep health and suicidal thoughts and behavior in a transdiagnostic sample of ultra-high risk adolescents (14-18) who have recently enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Program. We will capitalize on the extant clinical and research infrastructures to compare sleep-suicide associations and plausible affective, cognitive and arousal-related mechanisms using self-report, behavioral, lab task paradigms and physiology in adolescents at ultra-high risk for suicide. Project Narrative Despite the enormous public health problem of suicide among adolescents, little progress has been made toward improving assessment and prevention for this vulnerable group. We will conduct a prospective, longitudinal study to examine the near-term temporal associations between within-person fluctuations in sleep disturbance, dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, and changes in suicidality over time in ultra-high risk adolescents. Critically, since sleep is a modifiable risk factor, our findings hold great promise to inform the development or modification of existing sleep/mental health interventions to lower suicide risk.",The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents,10107391,R01MH124907,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Task Performances ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' sleep control ', ' sleep regulation ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' mood symptom ', ' outpatient programs ', ' outpatient services ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' poor sleep ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,766370
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutes ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Glean ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829
"Penn Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center This proposal is to develop the University of Pennsylvania’s Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects minority and disenfranchised populations, including Blacks, Hispanics and sexual/gender minorities. Yet, these groups often are not included in suicide prevention research. Guided by a conceptual model based on the Integrated Behavior Model, which posits that organizational culture, policies, and resources (or lack thereof) impact the provider’s attributes and behaviors, INSPIRE brings together psychology, implementation science, health economics, machine learning, health information technology, psychiatry and participatory research experts to apply innovative interdisciplinary approaches to suicide prevention. INSPIRE’s overarching goals are to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for underserved groups and to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness. INSPIRE will prioritize strategies that can be rapidly deployed in a range of practice settings, including those with limited resources, thereby increasing their reach and public health impact. Penn INSPIRE will use state-of-the-science methods from participatory research to actively engage stakeholders from many sectors – including patients, providers, and payers – at every level of its work to accomplish its Specific Aims. INSPIRE will apply innovative, interdisciplinary behavior change and implementation science methods to develop, adapt, and evaluate cost effective interventions. A Signature Project will use a stepped wedge study design to test an innovative organizational strategy that leverages telehealth to deliver high quality Safety Planning Intervention and follow-up services in Emergency Departments. Three Exploratory Projects will test novel strategies for suicide prevention across individual, clinician, and organizational levels and with specific vulnerable populations that will lay the foundation for more definitive studies. INSPIRE will also support 10 pilot projects and an innovative Methods Core that will develop and test new methods to advance research at the intersection of suicide prevention and implementation science. The Suicide Prevention Scholars Program will expand the cadre of suicide prevention researchers by engaging both emerging investigators and established scientists who do not currently work on suicide prevention – particularly those from groups under-represented in research – through content, design. and methodological mentoring and capacity-building. By catalyzing interdisciplinary, cross-sector collaborations and advancing suicide prevention research, care, and policy both locally and nationally, we will develop cost-effective, practical, and efficient ways to implement evidence-based suicide prevention interventions. INSPIRE is poised to be transformational for suicide prevention. The University of Pennsylvania Innovation In Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center’s overarching goals are: (1) to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for minority and disenfranchised groups, and (2) to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness.

"Air Pollution and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: A National Study Dementia is a major public health challenge with substantial economic and social burden, affecting more than 47 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes about two-thirds of dementia cases and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only diagnosis among the top 10 that cannot be cured. There is a pressing need to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) patients by identifying novel and modifiable risk factors that may reduce morbidity. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution – in particular fine particulate matter (PM2.5) – plays an important role in AD/ADRD pathogenesis. However, little is known about the relative contributions of different air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, ozone), nor about PM2.5 components. To facilitate the targeting of pollution control efforts, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have placed a high priority on determining which air pollutants and/or which components of PM2.5 are most toxic. In addition, one major gap in the emerging epidemiologic evidence on air pollution and AD/ADRD morbidity is that many previous studies have relied on hospitalizations as the measure of morbidity. Yet, hospitalization is not the typical course for AD/ADRD diagnosis and initial treatment. Instead, if it does occur for patients, hospitalization happens during the more advanced stages of the disease and usually for treating complications of the disease. Thus, hospitalization records do not accurately reflect disease incidence, and thus underestimate case numbers. Therefore, we propose a study that will leverage the massive datasets of high-resolution environmental exposure data and Medicare claims (including doctor visits where most AD/ADRD diagnoses would occur) across the contiguous US to better understand the influence of air pollution on AD/ADRD morbidity among US elderly, and identify potential vulnerable subpopulations, with the ultimate goal of informing environmental policy. We will (1) generate and validate a comprehensive, high- resolution, multiple-species, air pollution dataset across the contiguous US for 2000-2021, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5 mass, NO2, and ozone), PM2.5 components (including trace metals), as well as aerosol water and fine particle pH that may influence metal dissolution; (2) estimate the chronic effects of criteria pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) database, which includes Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims, doctor visits, skilled nursing facility, and home health-care claims for AD/ADRD among ~100 million Medicare beneficiaries; (3) assess the relative contributions of PM2.5 components and potential effect modification by aerosol water/pH on AD/ADRD risks using the nationwide Medicare cohort; and (4) conduct sensitivity analyses by correcting for exposure measurement error and outcome misclassification. Our proposed research will fill major knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of environmental exposures and AD/ADRD morbidity, and inform policy for targeted source-specific regulations and facilitate actionable measures that can prevent or mitigate the AD health burden due to air pollution. Project Narrative We will use advanced statistical methods to quantify the evidence of associations between ambient air pollution and AD/ADRD to better frame environmental policy. Leveraging national datasets capturing over 100 million Medicare beneficiaries, we will assess multiple types of air pollutants, including criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and ozone) and various PM2.5 chemical components.

"Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy Project Summary Motivation: Fluoroscopy is an indispensable tool for image-guided interventions in 50 million surgeries performed annually in the US. It leverages ionizing radiation from x-rays to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback. Radiation exposure is harmful for both the patients and surgeons. Repetitive patient exposure has been shown to double the risk of breast cancer in women; meanwhile, surgeon exposure is also concerning. Orthopedic surgeons are 5x more likely to develop cancer in their lifetime; spine surgeons receive up to 12x more radiation exposure compared to other orthopedic surgeons. With minimally invasive surgery becoming widely adopted in recent years, the use of fluoroscopy has greatly increased. Surgeons rely on the navigation provided by fluoroscopy during these procedures, as they do not have direct visualization of the anatomy. Therefore, reducing the radiation exposure from fluoroscopy while maintaining high imaging quality is a high priority. In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promising advances to improve the quality of medical imaging. Subtle Medical Inc. has already received FDA clearance for its AI-based software products to reduce the dose for PET by four times and improve image quality for MRI. The motivation of this proposal is to translate our initial success to another imaging modality and achieve low dose fluoroscopy. Approach: This phase I SBIR project has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop AI software using recurrent deep learning architecture to achieve 6x dose reduction for fluoroscopy. Aim 2 is to design model pruning, kernel optimization, and high-performance inference frameworks to achieve real-time processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively the developed software on phantoms and cadavers. Significance: This work will enable six times lower dose fluoroscopy. The completion of the project will have wide impact to greatly reduce radiation exposure in the operating room, hence reducing the risk of cancer development for both patients and clinicians. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy leverages ionizing radiation to provide surgeons with real-time, high-quality imaging feedback, indispensable for image-guided interventions in clinics. However, the radiation exposure introduces imaging risks, not only to the patients, but also to clinicians, who perform surgeries routinely. This project aims to develop and validate a fluoroscopy image enhancement software using artificial intelligence that can reduce the radiation dose by six folds.",Real-time AI-enhanced Low Dose Fluoroscopy,10385142,R43EB031655,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cadaver ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Spinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Surgeon ', ' processing speed ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' realtime model ', ' real time model ', ' model design ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' image guided intervention ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' minimally invasive ', ' operation ', ' Spine surgery ', ' Spinal surgery ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2021,123526
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide.

"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable.

"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies. NARRATIVE Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in diabetes development. We will evaluate novel epitranscriptomic mechanisms linking arsenic to diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in American Indian communities. This study can provide insight into novel pathways of arsenic related diabetes, identify prevention interventions, and inform recommendations for arsenic levels in water and food.",The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes.,10140691,R01ES032638,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Joints ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Names ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' South Dakota ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Hepatic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Elderly man ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Disputes ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' RNA Stability ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' histone modification ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Reader ', ' Cellular Stress Response ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Metabolic dysfunction ', ' epitranscriptomics ', ' epitranscriptome ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' data infrastructure ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' Mendelian randomization ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,684582
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism ', ' Affect ', ' Asia ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Birth Weight ', ' California ', ' Canada ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Esthetics ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' neurotoxic ', ' infant outcome ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' demographics ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' environmental justice ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' Geological Survey ', ' Geology Survey ', ' geological applications ', ' geological characterization ', ' geology characterization ', ' school district ', ' contaminated water ', ' Water contamination ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Child Health ', ' econometrics ', ' environmental health disparity ', ' geochemistry ', ' geochemical ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Afferent Pathways ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Control Groups ', ' middle ear ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hearing ', ' Noise-Induced Hearing Loss ', ' noise related hearing loss ', ' noise-induced hearing impairment ', ' Hearing Tests ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiometry ', ' auditory tests ', ' hearing assessment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kinetics ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Noise ', ' Occupational Noise ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Temporary Threshold Shift ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' otoacoustic emission ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Outer Hair Cells ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' farmer ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' aural muscle ', ' ear muscle ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Auditory system ', ' age group ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' musician ', ' professor ', ' dosimetry ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' conditioning ', ' demographics ', ' therapeutic lifestyle change ', ' screening ', ' clinically translatable ', ' recruit ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' cochlear synaptopathy ', ' Hearing Protection ', ' protect hearing ', ' Rapid screening ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10250303,R00ES028743,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' cypermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' supermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2021,249003
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced

"Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a serious public health concern in the United States. However, despite an increase in theoretical models of and treatments for suicide, the suicide rate has risen 33% since 1999. Given the widespread availability of smartphone technology, there is great potential to deliver interventions via mobile platforms. However, despite the proliferation of smartphone tools for suicide, few offer evidence-based support and some include potentially harmful content. In response, we have conducted initial development of a mobile suicide prevention system: Mobile Application to Prevent Suicide (MAPS). MAPS was specifically designed to identify increased suicide risk and deliver personalized intervention for patients transitioning out of a psychiatric hospital, a time of extraordinarily high risk. MAPS provides both a mobile app and clinician support, and includes multiple evidence-based components: (1) monitoring of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), (2) personalized, interactive coping strategy administration based on participants’ current risk state, (3) direct access to clinicians and crisis support services, and (4) psychoeducation. We will leverage existing components of MAPS and develop and test new features. To plan for sustainability of MAPS, we will deliver the intervention through the Butler Hospital Transitional Outpatient Program, assigning participants to master’s level hospital clinicians, and convene a Stakeholder Advisory Board with a focus on program sustainability. Specifically, the primary aim of this investigation is to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms (i.e., self-monitoring, use of coping strategies, reduction of negative affect, self-efficacy). The ultimate goal of this project is to further develop and refine the MAPS system and engage in preliminary testing in preparation for a fully-powered randomized clinical trial (R01) to establish effectiveness of the intervention in a larger health care system and to further optimize intervention components and delivery (e.g., machine learning techniques). This proposal outlines procedures for intervention and clinician training program refinement through focus groups and open and randomized pilot trials. Thus, the present study is designed to develop the tools, procedures, and knowledge base for a novel intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is a major public health problem, with over 47,000 deaths by suicide per year, and individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals are at extraordinarily elevated risk for suicide. Currently available treatments for suicide have not led to a decrease in the suicide rate. The primary aim of the present study is leverage existing infrastructure to develop novel technological features for a novel personalized smartphone intervention system, and to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms.","Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide.",10107455,R34MH124971,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Collection ', ' Emotions ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' mental health facility ', ' Inpatients ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' healthcare professional practice ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' falls ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' behavioral health ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' recruit ', ' outpatient programs ', ' outpatient services ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' Infrastructure ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' effectiveness study ', ' ']",NIMH,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R34,2021,236986
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Bereavement ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Future ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicide model ', ' expressive writing ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal individual ', ' loved ones ', ' primary outcome ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' informal support ', ' web-based tool ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities Project Summary/Abstract Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, particularly among youth aged 10–24 years. Youth in smaller, more rural communities, particularly American Indian/Native American youth, face heightened risk. Developing and delivering effective suicide prevention programs requires the means to rigorously evaluate their impact. Conducting impact evaluations of suicide prevention programs faces many challenges common to other fields, such as the difficulty in estimating the counterfactual when randomization is not feasible. These challenges are further compounded by the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of suicide rates in communities and segments of the population with heightened risk due to the small size of such communities. Building on small area estimation techniques, Bayesian disease-mapping models were developed to improve estimation of disease or health outcome rates in small areas by borrowing information from neighboring areas. Despite their potential, these models have not been applied to program impact evaluation. This study has three aims: (1) examine a method to assess suicide prevention impact in small areas with heightened suicide risk; (2) identify particular conditions under which our proposed method can outperform alternative methods for impact evaluation; and (3) extend earlier assessments of the impact of the Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial youth suicide prevention program administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration by focusing on small, high-risk communities, such as tribal communities, that were underrepresented in previous study samples. This study will use both simulated and real data to empirically assess the accuracy of the proposed approach vis-à-vis three alternative methods to estimate impact: synthetic control, elastic net, and matrix completion. The simulated data will allow us to gauge how different levels of spatial and temporal dependence, as well as variations in other relevant parameters, affect the relative performance of approaches. Finally, we will use a sample of micropolitan and noncore communities exposed to the GLS program between 2006 and 2018 to estimate the impact of the GLS program on both suicide and self-harm hospitalization rates among youth. In sum, by applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to suicide prevention impact evaluation, we expect to both extend the utility of the approach beyond disease mapping and advance the ability to understand suicide prevention programming impact in some of the highest-risk populations. Project Narrative When evaluating suicide prevention programs, the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of the outcome of interest in small communities and among segments of the population with heightened risk, including youth in rural communities or American Indian/Native American youth, compounds the usual challenges associated with assessing the impact of an intervention. We propose a novel approach for suicide prevention impact assessment in such settings, based on recent developments in Bayesian disease mapping, and will examine the performance of the approach using both simulated and real data from the Garrett Lee Smith youth suicide prevention program evaluation funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. If our findings reveal our approach to be accurate, this will provide an improved method to assess suicide prevention programming impact and will extend previous demonstrated impact findings to high-risk populations.",Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities,10213274,R03MH123905,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' County ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Prevention program ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' community intervention ', ' tribal community ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' public health priorities ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' rural Americans ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIMH,"ICF MACRO, INC.",R03,2021,73629
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10130714,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,231701
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The HERCULES Center is focused on providing a more comprehensive assessment of these environmental influences by utilizing exposome-based concepts and approaches.",HERCULES: Exposome Research Center,10144435,P30ES019776,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Toxicology ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P30 Protein ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Intuition ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Marshal ', ' health science research ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment strategy ', ' operation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,1471985
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Country ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical risk ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' genetic architecture ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736
