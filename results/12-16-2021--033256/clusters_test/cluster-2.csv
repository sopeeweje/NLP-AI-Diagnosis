"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making.

"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,10056204,F31CA228331,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosome abnormality ', ' Aberrant Chromosome ', ' Chromosomal Aberrations ', ' Chromosomal Abnormalities ', ' Chromosomal Alterations ', ' Chromosome Aberrations ', ' Chromosome Alterations ', ' Chromosome Anomalies ', ' Cytogenetic Aberrations ', ' Cytogenetic Abnormalities ', ' chromosomal defect ', ' chromosome defect ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Histones ', ' Hybrids ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Deep learning for understanding gene regulation in diseases via 'omics' integration PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop and refine neural networks gene expression to understand gene regulation in diseases. We will design deep learning frameworks to integrate various datasets (histone modifications, 3D conformation, sequences, and SNPs) and model their relationship with the gene expression. Our proposed models will explicitly capture the underlying structure and complexity of the biological data to learn meaningful connections. For example, we will use a graph-based neural network to model the 3D conformation of the DNA as a graph and learn from the connections between different genomic regions to predict gene expression. One of our critical goals for using these methods is to extract relevant signals that could be contributing to the up- and down-regulation of genes. We will accomplish this goal by applying interpretation methods for neural networks. These methods will allow us to assign importance scores to the input features that contribute the most towards a particular prediction of interest. Comparing these scores for genes across healthy and disease cell lines will provide insights into gene misregulation and serve as a hypothesis driving tool for biological experiments. We also propose a novel Bayesian inference-based interpretation method to improve explanations of graph-based neural networks that could be applied to various tasks. Finally, given the improvement of single-cell technologies and imputation methods, we will extend our deep learning frameworks to model relationships between signals like chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation with gene expression. This direction will allow us to explore the effectiveness of the imputation methods in removing noise and generating high-quality single-cell samples for usage in deep learning modeling of gene regulation. Looking at the modeled relationships across the cell's developmental stages could pinpoint timepoints for potential misregulation in diseases. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop unified approaches that utilize datasets spanning multiple repositories to leverage their collective knowledge and improve our understanding of diseases in a data-driven manner. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to use deep learning to integrate multiple genomic datasets and connect them to gene expression.

"ClinTAD: A Tool for Improving Clinical CNV Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DNA microarray is a routine clinical pediatric diagnostic test to identify genomic copy number variants (CNVs) that could be causative of autism, developmental delay, and multiple congenital anomalies. This test is also used frequently in the prenatal setting to find genomic causes of fetal anomalies found by ultrasound, or to predict potential phenotypes postnatally. Current clinical guidelines for interpretation of CNVs focus solely on the characteristics of genes contained within the CNV breakpoints. However, recent studies on chromatin architecture, utilizing Hi-C or related techniques, have demonstrated that CNVs can also disrupt the structure of topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are “neighborhoods” of physical DNA interactions that serve several functions, including the prevention of ectopic gene-enhancer interactions. This TAD disruption can lead to pathogenic alterations in transcription of genes outside the CNV region that are ultimately causative of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is by only focusing on genes within the CNV region for clinical interpretation, critical genomic information is being entirely ignored in DNA microarray interpretation, ultimately leading to missed diagnoses for patients. To address this issue, we have recently developed the free-to-use software ClinTAD (www.clintad.com; J Hum Genet (2019)) to assist in the interpretation of CNVs while taking potential TAD disruption into account. To our knowledge, this is the first software of its kind to attempt to integrate TADs into clinical CNV interpretation. While ClinTAD v1.0 is currently available as a decision support tool to assist in clinical practice, it is currently limited both in its ease-of-use as well as its predictive power. Further enhancing the utility of ClinTAD motivates the two Aims of our proposal here: 1) We aim to optimize ClinTAD as both a clinical decision support and research tool by allowing incorporation of TAD boundaries from different datasets, enabling an API for analysis of large case cohorts, adding interpretation tools for Regions of Homozygosity found on SNP array, and allowing for creation of a de-identified database where users can upload cases with suspicion for pathogenicity based on TAD disruption. 2) We aim to improve the predictive power of ClinTAD through machine learning to identify the most predictive features of pathogenicity in a large, publicly available CNV cohorts, as well as by incorporating a recently-described convolutional neural network-based model which can predict TAD disruption as a function of CNV breakpoints. In this proposal we aim to make ClinTAD the premier tool for the interpretation of CNVs in the context of TAD disruption. Our long- term goal is to build a collaborative network of users that will enable us to identify patients with the most probability of having clinical phenotypes caused by TAD disruption. Such a unique patient cohort could then form the basis of a first-of-its kind trial to evaluate the utility of Hi-C as a clinical test. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with conditions such as autism, developmental delay, and other abnormalities found at birth frequent have a medical test done called DNA microarray. While this test is certainly useful, we believe that this test is missing the correct diagnosis in some patients because of limitations in current guidelines for interpreting test data.

"Genomes in 3D: from maps to mechanisms Project Summary In each of our trillions of cells, genetic information is stored on meter-long chromosomes spatially organized inside micron-scale nuclei. In the past decade, large-scale efforts have built increasingly detailed atlases of transcription, regulatory elements, and genome folding across ever-expanding sets of cell types and tissues. Still, these beautiful maps do not by themselves reveal the sequences or molecular mechanisms acting in these diverse cellular contexts. Drawing on approaches from biophysics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, this project will develop novel computational approaches to determine the DNA sequences and mechanisms underlying 3D genome organization, and how this in turn relates to genomic functions. Drawing on the latest breakthroughs in machine learning, we will model how individual nucleotides contribute to genome folding. We will apply these models to characterize cell-type specific genome folding, develop methods to engineer DNA sequences in silico, and model enhancer-promoter influences. Concurrently, we will build biophysical models to understand deeply conserved mechanisms of genome folding. Using meiotic chromosome folding as a model system, we will develop models to learn new rules governing cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion. To uncover how extrusion interfaces with other mechanisms, we will build models of synaptonemal complex assembly, as well as models of meiotic chromosome organization across species. By honing in on the sequences most crucial for locus-specific genome folding and characterizing the mechanisms driving genome- wide folding, the computational models we develop and the mechanisms we discover will enable new approaches to precision genome engineering. This will include how to re-wire gene-regulatory circuits, not only by targeting enhancers and promoters, but also by modulating their cell-type specific communication. At the same time, the aims described here will bridge fundamental insights into 3D chromosome organization with clinical genomics, and greatly improve the interpretability of non-coding DNA variants. Project Narrative Non-coding DNA sequences play crucial roles in gene regulation and the physical organization of the genome, with roles in development and consequences for disease. Using novel biophysical modeling and machine- learning approaches, this project will connect fundamental insights into 3D genome organization with the functional consequences of its disruption.

"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Beds ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' diet supplementation ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' cell type ', ' Maternal Nutrition ', ' Maternal diet ', ' maternal nutrition during pregnancy ', ' mother nutrition ', ' IAP Elements ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle Elements ', ' Retrotransposon ', ' offspring ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' assistive reproductive technology ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' Genomics ', ' embryo culture ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Mouse ', ' Supplementation ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Seminal ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' mouse genome ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' critical period ', ' mouse development ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' early pregnancy ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' DNA methylation profiling ', ' Methyl-Seq ', ' MethylSeq ', ' Methylation sequencing ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation.

"Developing novel deep-learning based methods for deciphering non-coding gene regulatory code SUMMARY This project will contribute novel pre-trained DNA Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, called DNABERT, and associated deep-learning tools to decipher the language of non-coding DNA and facilitate integration of gene regulatory information from rapidly accumulating sequence data with NLM’s genetic databases (for example, dbSNP, dbGaP and ClinVar), which serve both scientists and the public health by helping identify the genetic components of disease. While the genetic code explaining how DNA is translated into proteins is universal, the regulatory code that determines when and how the genes are expressed varies across different cell-types and organisms. Non-coding DNA is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, from a language modeling perspective. Recently, deep learning methods have been used in unraveling the gene regulatory code, but failed to globally and robustly model such language features in the genome, especially in data-scarce scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose DNABERT to model DNA as a language, by adapting the idea of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Based on recent observations in natural language processing research, we hypothesize that pre-trained transformer-based neural network model offer a promising, and yet not fully explored, deep learning approach for a variety of sequence prediction tasks in the analysis of non-coding DNA. Our preliminary results showed that DNABERT on the human genome achieved state-of-the-art performance on promoter and splice-site prediction tasks, after easy fine-tuning on small task-specific data (Ji, Y. et al. 2020). The goal of our proposed research is to develop DNABERT for a variety of sequence prediction tasks, and benchmark with existing state- of-the-art deep-learning based methods. Specific aims are (1) develop novel deep-learning methods by adapting BERT; (2) apply the proposed deep-learning methods to specifically target non-coding DNA sequence analyses and predictions; and (3) predict and validate functional non-coding genetic variants by applying DNABERT prediction models. A major contribution of the proposed research is development of pre-trained DNABERT model and prediction algorithms, which present new powerful methods for analyses and predictions of DNA sequences. Since the pre-training of DNABERT is resource-intensive, we will provide the source code and pre-trained model at Github for future academic research. We will also develop an integrated web server to (1) deploy DNABERT model, (2) database to store the identified sequence features and predictions, and (3) tutorials to help users to apply DNABERT to their specific research problems. We anticipate that DNABERT can bring new advancements and insights to the bioinformatics community by bringing advanced language modeling perspective to gene regulation analyses. Public health relevance statement: The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by non-coding genetic variants is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. This project will contribute novel pre-trained deep-learning tools to decipher the language of non- coding DNA and facilitate integration of gene regulatory information from rapidly accumulating

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",10241049,U01HG009395,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Parents ', ' Ploidies ', ' DNA Content ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' chromosome complement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Loop ', ' Chromatin Loop Domains ', ' DNA Loop ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Output ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' next generation ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' transcriptomics ', ' sequence learning ', ' genome annotation ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing ', ' DNase-seq ', ' DNaseI-seq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,742538
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,10210409,R35GM133562,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Nuclear ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Property ', ' B lymphocyte differentiation ', ' B cell differentiation ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2021,472500
"Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape Project Summary/Abstract The candidate, Wenpin Hou, PhD, is an applied mathematician and computational biologist serving as a postdoctoral fellow of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). Her long-term career goal is to improve clinical practice in therapy for diseases by developing computational and statistical methods to decipher spatial and temporal gene regulatory programs using multi-omics data and implementing these methods into developmental process and diseases. The research she proposes entitled Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape combines advanced spatial transcriptomics techniques with computational methods to infer spatial DNA methylation landscape, which enables the accurate evaluation of the epigenomic spatial variability and epigenomic targets in therapy for diseases.

"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual.

"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Compound Q ', ' Trichosanthin ', ' alpha-Trichosanthin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' carrier status ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' web-based tool ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' screening panel ', ' screening program ', ' random forest ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Play ', ' Reagent ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Scanning ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' synthetic construct ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' genetic technology ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Polymerase ', ' Length ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' cost ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' synthetic biology ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth

"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Carrying Capacities ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Poly A ', ' Poly(rA) ', ' polyadenylate ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Chromosomal translocation ', ' Chromosomal dislocation ', ' Genetic Translocation ', ' chromosome dislocation ', ' chromosome translocation ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs ', ' G(s), alpha Subunit ', ' G(s), α Subunit ', ' G(s)alpha ', ' G(s)α ', ' GTP-Binding Protein α Subunits, Gs ', ' Gs alpha Family G-Protein ', ' Gsα ', ' Gαs ', ' Regulatory Ns Protein ', ' Stimulatory Gs G-Protein ', ' alpha Subunit Stimulatory GTP-Binding Protein ', ' alpha-Gs ', ' α-Gs ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' non-sense mutation ', ' Nonsense Mutation ', ' experience ', ' nuclease ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Trans RNA Splicing ', ' Trans-Splicing ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' immunogenic ', ' miniaturize ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Intervening Protein Sequence ', ' Protein Introns ', ' intein ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' technology research and development ', ' technological research and development ', ' computational suite ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,10178047,R35GM133580,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Histones ', ' Medicine ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' combinatorial ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' epigenome ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,377555
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['Dependovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Atopic Dermatitis ', ' Atopic Eczema ', ' Atopic Neurodermatitis ', ' Disseminated Neurodermatitis ', ' allergic dermatitis ', ' allergic eczema ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epidermis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Ichthyoses ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Kinetics ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Proteins ', ' Psoriasis ', ' psoriasiform ', ' psoriatic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' dermal disease ', ' dermal disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Skin Carcinoma ', ' skin squamous cell carcinoma ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genomics ', ' gene induction ', ' Skin ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' keratinocyte differentiation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' skin barrier ', ' cutaneous barrier ', ' dermal barrier ', ' epidermal barrier ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' recruit ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691
"Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA Project Summary Somatic copy number amplification (SCNA) of tumor promoting oncogenes, and focal copy number amplifi- cations specifically, are a major driver of cancer pathogenicity. Recent results have revealed that that focal oncogene amplification is mediated to a large extent by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) i.e., large (1.3 Mb on average), highly amplified, oncogene-containing circular molecules that occur in nearly 25% of cancers across all sub-types, but rarely in normal cells. Unresolved questions regarding the formation, evolution, het- erogeneity, and pathogenicity of ecDNA are becoming central to uncovering vulnerabilities that can be targeted for diagnostics and therapy. The proposed project will enhance and disseminate “Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA.” Specifically, we will (1) de- velop CAPER (a Community Accessible Pipeline for EcDNA Reconstruction) by leveraging the GenePattern ecosystem to provide an easy point and click interface to running the CPU, memory and storage heavy soft- ware; (2) design and implement novel algorithmic improvements to the CAPER work flow, including support for long-reads and integration of Omics data; and, (3) enable the broad adoption of CAPER through strategic collaborations, outreach and education. Project Narrative Increased activity of cancer-causing genes (onco-genes) is often due to increased copy numbers mediated by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). We propose to enhance our software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of ecDNA and make them available to the research community as user- friendly tools. The resulting resource will enable advances in ecDNA biology and help identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in currently intractable cancers.","Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA",10305480,U24CA264379,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cations ', ' Centromere ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Metaphase ', ' Mitotic Metaphase ', ' Methods ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' extrachromosomal DNA ', ' DNA analysis ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Hour ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' Capers ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Normal Cell ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Cloud Service ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' Visualization ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,749120

"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.

"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases.

"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic

"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic.

Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders.

"Genomic medicine and gene function implementation for an underserved population PROJECT SUMMARY Here we propose to advance the goal of NHGRI to implement genomic medicine and focus on individuals who have not been able to afford DNA testing. The research takes place in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Childrens Hospital (TCH). Our team of clinicians, geneticists, computer scientists, genomicists and model organism researchers has had a five-year term of success with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Model Organisms Screening Center (MOSC). This has included successfully identifying a number of new disease genes such as EBF3, IRF2BPL, NACC1, TBX2, TOMM70, CDK19, ACOX1, WDR37, and ATP5F1D. We propose to recruit 100 individuals from an underserved population in Houston, Texas with suspected rare disease and without the means to pay for DNA sequencing through insurance. We will provide whole-exome sequencing which will generate a CAP/CLIA report that we anticipate could diagnose 35-40 individuals per year. The remaining individuals will then be converted to a family-based trio exome design. All the sequencing costs of this project will be covered by philanthrophic donation to our hospital and are not budgeted to the grant. We will make every effort to diagnose the remaining 60 individuals per year through machine learning and informatics using the MARRVEL platform, Drosophila functional studies of candidate genes and through ongoing 6 month, 12 month and 2 year follow-up with the patients where we will use matchmaking efforts such as GeneMatcher and Matchmaker exchange as well as our own genomic databases from the UDN and other studies to come to a genetic diagnosis. All subjects will receive genetic counseling from a trained team and will provide us with valuable medical, psychological and social data to guide how genomic implementation in an underserved population is perceived, impacts care and impacts the family. This work will not only produce novel insights into rare disease, diagnosis for undiagnosed families and an expanded role for genomics, it will guide us in the future to provide genomics and functional research to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research study uses DNA sequencing to find a diagnose for families with children with a rare disease who may not be able to afford DNA sequencing studies. We use clinical testing, followed by more extensive computer technology and genetic research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study genetic variation in patients with rare and undiagnosed disease.

"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria.

"Investigation of ssDNA binding proteins and protein-ssDNA interactions Project Summary/Abstract Molecular interactions between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) play crucial roles in many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, gene regulation, and genome stability. ssDNA-binding proteins encompass various degrees of binding specificity, ranging from highly specific to non-specific. Despite the critical roles of protein-ssDNA interactions in essential biological processes, the investigation of protein-ssDNA interactions lags far behind other types of protein-nucleic acids interactions, such as protein-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) interaction. Currently there are no comprehensive, well-annotated resources for studying protein- ssDNA interactions. This proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of protein-ssDNA interactions by first constructing well-annotated protein-ssDNA data resources and by performing comparative analysis at two different levels. The first is to compare structural features between protein-ssDNA complexes with different binding specificity. The second is to investigate the similarity/differences between protein- ssDNA and protein-dsDNA complexes. In addition, we propose to predict novel ssDNA binding proteins from the unannotated protein sequences by combining structure-based protein threading methods and sequence-based machine learning approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to build comprehensive data resources for studying complexes between protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to investigate the structure and function of ssDNA binding proteins.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",10197158,R01GM134056,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Arabidopsis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Transgenes ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' mutant ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Small RNA ', ' Address ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Plant Model ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' cell stress ', ' Cis-Acting Sequence ', ' Cis-Acting Locus ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' public health priorities ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' methylation pattern ', ' epigenetic memory ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,319720
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,10112878,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' Laryngeal dystonia ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' Injections ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,696730
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA

"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",10128377,R21AI149694,"['Bacteria ', '
