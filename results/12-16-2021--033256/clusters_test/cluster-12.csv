"Development of a vaccine informatics system and its application to identifying the impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during a global pandemic Vaccine debate has been on social media for more than a decade, and a surge of anti-vaccine activities on social media has been detected during prior disease outbreaks. Nonetheless, how this debate changes and impacts the uptake rates for crucial vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. The long-term goal is to counteract the negative impact of misinformation on digital platforms that threatens public health. The overall objectives of this application are to develop a publicly accessible vaccine informatics system to track vaccine debate, and to test the impact of vaccine debate on COVID-19 (if developed by 2021), flu, and HPV immunization rates during the onset of a global pandemic. The central hypothesis is that vaccine debate will increase and become more negative during the pandemic, leading to lower vaccine uptake rates. The rationale for this project is that discovering how vaccine debate changes and influences vaccine uptake rates during a pandemic will be critically important for managing and preventing disease spread. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop a vaccine informatics system to identify the frequency and valence of vaccine debate during and following the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic baseline; and 2) Apply this system to identify the causal impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during the pandemic. Under the first aim, ~1 million social media posts will be collected, and a deep-learning algorithm for classifying multimodal social media posts will be developed. This algorithm will address potential bias and noise in human annotations of vaccine debate that is increasingly politicized. The classification results will be tabulated in a Web portal so that daily and weekly statistics about pro- and anti-vaccine posts will be readily available. Under the second aim, a multimethod approach will be proposed that resolves the current barriers in research on vaccine refusal. This approach will use a survey of 2,000 individuals who represent the US population. The survey responses will be combined with the respondents' prior engagement with vaccine debate retrospectively collected from social media. These engagement data will be then classified by the machine- learning algorithm developed in Aim 1. This research is innovative because it proposes a robust co-teaching framework for addressing noisy human annotations of vaccine debate. It also proposes a statistical modeling technique that involves heterogenous metrics obtained from a multi-method approach for hypothesis testing. These innovations are timely and urgent as the current time presents a rare opportunity to identify the impact of vaccine debate on public health during the onset of a global pandemic. The feasibility of this proposed research is clear from the solid preliminary datasets collected from 2018-2020 that establish the pre-pandemic baseline. The proposed research is significant because it will produce a public barometer of vaccine debate and provide a methodological breakthrough in uncovering the reasoning behind refusing crucial vaccines during the global pandemic. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the novel vaccine informatics system will gather information about vaccine debate on social media, and apply it to identify the negative impact of social media anti-vaccine content on immunization rates for COVID-19, flu and HPV during the onset of a global pandemic. The expected outcomes will vertically advance knowledge about effective data management and vaccine-refusal increases during public health crises. This will enable public health officials to focus their intervention efforts on those who are at risk of delaying or refusing crucial vaccines during a pandemic, thereby reducing healthcare costs for managing epidemics and decreasing morbidity.",Development of a vaccine informatics system and its application to identifying the impact of vaccine debate on immunization rates during a global

"Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  The proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the candidate with the conceptual knowledge and technical skills needed for a career of an independent investigator focused on the engagement of behavioral and neural network targets during personalized psychotherapies for mid- and late depression. The candidate will conduct her training and research activities at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.  The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Future ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Generations ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' geriatric depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' reward circuitry ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' geriatric major depression ', ' late life major depression ', ' therapeutic target ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' biosignature ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' Positive Valence ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram.

"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Belief ', ' Borderline Personality Disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Personality Disorders ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Planning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' social space ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Symptoms ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' virtual ', ' social neuroscience ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' geometric structure ', ' structural geometry ', ' social anxiety ', ' social learning ', ' Grain ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social relationships ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality.

"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hotlines ', ' Telephone Hotlines ', ' Impulsive Behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Shame ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Victimization ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-Sexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' queer ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' brain circuitry ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' family support ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer ', ' smartphone based assessment ', ' mobile assessment ', ' smart phone based assessment ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061
"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Animal Feed ', ' animal food ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Breeding ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Monkeys ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ovulation ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Progesterone ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' cohesion ', ' Practice Management ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social unrest ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' social bonding ', ' social attachment ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' animal resource ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Consumption ', ' Trauma ', ' season of birth ', ' network models ', ' pregnant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' social neuroscience ', ' resilience ', ' optogenetics ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' neural correlate ', ' redshift ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruit ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social interventions ', ' Affect ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' social competition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' cell cortex ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' ']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' experience ', ' adult animal ', ' mature animal ', ' free behavior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' social communication ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' source localization ', ' microphone ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for

"MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION Critical developments in neuroscience have included technologies for sequencing individual brain cells, progress towards completing a full mesoscale brain cell atlas in mice, new tools for monitoring and manipulating the activity of brain cells, refined imaging techniques for developing structural and functional connectome atlases in humans, and new objective measures for characterizing behavior across species. Nevertheless, a critical gap that has yet to be addressed is the development of a model that would allow this emerging catalog of cellular information to be linked to the broad functional networks that encode emotional behavior in mammals. This gap exists in part because 1) technologies that measure, monitor, and decode mesoscale activity throughout the depth of the brain during free behavior in mammalian model species have yet to be implemented in conjunction with cellular activity can be monitored and manipulated, and 2) theoretical frameworks that link cellular activity to mesoscale network activity and that generalize across subjects on a mouse-by-mouse basis have yet to be developed. Our multi-disciplinary team has built a suite of tools for studying how brain dynamics encode complex brain states. These include advanced techniques to measure and monitor brain dynamics in vivo concurrently for months across many regions located throughout the depth of the brain at high spatiotemporal resolution in freely-behaving mice, machine-learning analytic approaches that build individual circuit activity measures into composite networks, behavioral manipulations that can be used to induce brain states related to emotions, viral methods that probe the relationship between cellular changes and the expression of brain-wide neural dynamics, and closed-loop stimulation tools that can potentially test the causality of brain network-states in mediating emotion. By integrating this suite of tools in a single framework, we intend to create a model that will catalogue how the brain generates aggression. Critically, we believe that this model framework will be broadly applicable to other emotional brain states as well. Many cortical and subcortical brain regions work together to coordinate social emotional brain states. In this study we propose to build a model from experimental data that explains how these regions work together to generate aggression. We will test this model using established and emerging therapeutics utilized to treat aggression in the clinic, and we will develop new brain stimulation methodologies to regulate aggressive brain states uncovered by our model.",MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION,10124784,R01MH125430,"['Action Potentials ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrodes ', ' Emotions ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Music ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' Habenula ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Agonist ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' brain cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' free behavior ', ' sensory motor system ', ' sensorimotor system ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Operating System ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' spatial integration ', ' information processing ', ' emotional behavior ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,608910
"Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots PROJECT SUMMARY When Confucius said, “Tell me who are your friends, and I’ll tell you who you are,” he was noticing that how we behave and communicate is shaped by who we choose to hang out with every day. We constantly mimic the mannerisms and behaviors of friends and loved ones. Yet the neural basis of how we imitate, and more importantly who we choose to emulate and why, is largely unknown. Parrots provide a powerful yet untapped model system for social learning. Parrots, like humans and non-human primates, live in a specific type of ‘fission- fusion’ social network in which making and maintaining friendships is the key to fitness. Like humans, they selectively imitate and learn the names of their carefully selected companions. Here we aim to launch parrots as a new animal model in systems neuroscience. In aims 1, we will record neural activity in the vocal motor cortical output of the song system (nucleus AAC) in pairs of budgerigars engaged in courtship interactions. In these first- ever neural recordings form awake, behaving parrots, we are finding that AAC neurons exhibit premotor signals for vocalizations (as expected) and for expressive gestures such as silent kissing, head-bobbing and allogrooming. This joint vocal and gestural neural control, observed in human Broca’s area but not in songbirds – means that what was thought to be a songbird-like ‘song system’ is actually a more general system for social interaction. We next test the causal relationship between song system activity and social behavior. Inactivating AAC during courtship interactions will test if/how vocalizations and gestures degrade or lose their coordination (Aim 2.1). Inactivating frontal or posterior cortical inputs to AAC in bonded pairs will test the songbird-inspired idea that variability and order depend on distinct cortical pathways (Aim 2.2). For each inactivation experiment, a pair of interacting birds is conceptualized as a single dynamical system – and we will use machine learning guided behavioral analysis to quantify how vocalizations and gestures change (or do not) in both the inactivated and non-inactivated partner. Finally, in Aim 3 we will image dopamine (DA) release using fiber photometry and genetically encoded DA sensors. Pilot data demonstrate feasibility of DA imaging in singing birds. These experiments will test for the first time if DA signals, known to evaluate the quality of reward outcomes, similarly evaluate social outcomes. Courtship dynamics are perfect because gestural ‘requests’ to allogroom or ‘kiss’ are rejected or accepted with visually and acoustically obvious ‘consent’ or ‘deny’ signals. Males make hundreds of advances per day and use female feedback to learn – providing natural trial structure, within-session learning, and ‘events’ to which we can align simultaneously recorded male and female DA signals – which may or may not come into alignment as a pair ‘decides’ to bond or not. Budgerigar interactions resemble human conversations – a back-and-forth of vocalizations and gestures that both communicate agonistic or affiliative signals and control vocal learning and partner selection. Together, these experiments will help establish parrots as a new model system in social neuroscience and will ready us for a follow-up R01 submission in two years. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Humans thrive or suffer on the basis of social acceptance and rejection, but little is known about what goes on in the brain during high-stakes social interactions. Here, we will perform the first-ever neural recordings from socializing parrots to test how vocalizations and communicative gestures are coordinated during courtship and how the outcomes of romantic advances are encoded in the dopamine system.",Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots,10207958,R34NS121898,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beak ', ' Behavior ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', "" Broca's area "", ' Melopsittacus ', ' Budgerigars ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communication ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Courtship ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Gestures ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pair Bond ', ' Parakeets ', ' Psittacidae ', ' Parrots ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Photometry ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Friends ', ' Generations ', ' Assimilations ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Friendships ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Fiber ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Companions ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' vocalization ', ' Cannulas ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Oscines ', ' song bird ', ' Songbirds ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' vocal learning ', ' fitness ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' social neuroscience ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' social communication ', ' stereotypy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' vocal control ', ' motor control ', ' dopamine system ', ' loved ones ', ' social learning ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' microphone ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Social outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,689222
"Behavioral and Neurocognitive Mechanisms linking Peer Victimization to Adolescent Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for many forms of psychopathology, particularly depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. Disorders that emerge during this time have lasting consequences, including elevated risk of recurrence, and poor psychosocial functioning. This vulnerability comes at a time when peer victimization becomes more common and emotional and physiological responses to peer rejection are elevated, rendering victimization particularly damaging during adolescence. Despite the strong links between peer victimization and internalizing problems during adolescence, the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear, limiting our ability to prevent the onset of victimization-related psychopathology in youth. The proposed project will test a novel conceptual model, in which it is proposed that two underlying dimensions of peer victimization, peer threat (e.g., presence of negative social experiences, like rejection) and peer deprivation (e.g., absence of positive social experiences, like ostracism) differentially shape neurocognitive processes and social behaviors that have relevance for psychopathology. Specifically, it is argued that peer threat influences neurocognitive and behavioral processes in ways that enhance threat detection and processing (Aim 1), whereas experiences of peer deprivation may contribute to blunted reward sensitivity and low social motivation (Aim 2). The project will then examine whether neurocognitive and behavioral alterations serve as mechanisms linking peer victimization with internalizing psychopathology (Aim 3). The proposed research will test this conceptual model by using a combination of experimental behavioral and fMRI tasks, as well as an intensive longitudinal design, leveraging advancements in digital phenotyping, computational neuroscience, and predictive modeling approaches. Critically, by implementing advanced statistical machine learning methods for predictive modeling, the proposed research may be able to identify patterns of real-world social behavior that are influenced by victimization and, in turn, predict the emergence of psychopathology. Identifying developmental processes that are disrupted following peer victimization and ultimately lead to psychopathology is a necessary first step in developing targeted intervention approaches. This award will also provide the candidate, who has a strong background in developmental social neuroscience and clinical science, with critical training in the implementation of digital phenotyping, computational modeling, and advanced statistical techniques to promote a successful transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peer victimization is a common and potent predictor of psychopathology in adolescence, but the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. I will test a novel conceptual model assessing how dimensions of peer victimization—peer threat and peer deprivation—differentially shape neurocognitive processes and social behaviors that confer risk for internalizing psychopathology. Identifying developmental processes that are disrupted following peer victimization and ultimately lead to psychopathology is a necessary first step in developing targeted intervention approaches to mitigate the effects of peer victimization on youths.",Behavioral and Neurocognitive Mechanisms linking Peer Victimization to Adolescent Psychopathology,10371679,K99MH126163,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Motivation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' peer victimization ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' reward processing ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' information processing ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social media ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,123903
"A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources Project Summary Access and participation in community resource programs such as transportation, housing and medication assistance - also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) is inextricably linked to a successful treatment and recovery in substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, health and social service providers dedicate a significant amount of time to curate local community resource listings or “referral binders”. These “referral binders” are often highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations and by using expensive non-scalable solutions technology vendors in this domain have not fully addressed this problem. Furthermore, participation in such community programs is also hindered by the absence of highly efficient program eligibility screening tools. Undoubtedly, these shortcomings contribute to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD.  We report two feasibility outcomes from our SBIR Phase I study. 1) A novel co-creation led business model that leverages local partnerships with subject matter expertise agencies on SUD and SDOH - can provide enhanced access to community resource programs at the point-of-care. 2) A highly adaptive digital assisted SDOH screening tool powered by novel conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies can enhance patients’ participation in SDOH related community programs. This is achieved by using these technologies to perform program eligibility screenings through both web and text messaging channels coupled with patient triaging within a case work team. The purpose of this Phase II study is to: 1) Optimize and scale the community resource co-creation business model established in Phase I by onboarding eight co-creation partners in Texas within 2 years. 2) Examine the relationship between the conversational AI and NLP powered SDOH screening tool piloted in Phase I with SUD outcomes among youths and young adults. Specifically, we will partner with the Harris Center for Mental Health and IDD - the largest outpatient mental health provider in Texas to examine whether youths screened and enrolled into a treatment program using our technology report improved SUD outcomes. As AI and NLP are core pillars of our technology we will also investigate and subsequently correct for potential societal biases and stereotypes (e.g. race, gender) encoded in such technologies. This effort will avoid such biases to inadvertently determine outcomes in our downstream prediction tasks. The key Phase II milestones include; 1) Demonstrable evidence that the co-creation business model leads to enhanced access to SDOH and SUD community resources at the point-of-care. 2) An understanding on whether screening and eventual participation in a treatment program as supported by our conversational AI technology can lead to reduced encounters with law enforcement including CPS among youths with mental health and SUD. In summary, the proposed Phase II work will lead to enhanced access to SUD recovery capital and facilitate patients’ participation in local health and SDOH community programs. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase II proposal will expand our co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our AI powered digital assisted SDOH screening tool will identify eligible patients and connect them to the services to improve the efficiency of patient screening and intake process.",A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources,10360396,R44DA051063,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Capital ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Privatization ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' Services ', ' mental health center ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' point of care ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Coupled ', ' service utilization ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' screening ', ' Patient Triage ', ' community partnership ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' service programs ', ' patient screening ', ' service providers ', ' societal costs ', ' treatment risk ', ' social factors ', ' substance use treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R44,2021,397696
"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability.

"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,10057391,R01MH118327,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' impression ', ' Performance ', ' Biologic Development ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Consumption ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' natural language ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Grain ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,720921
"Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S. NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S. ABSTRACT Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality— miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.  These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.  Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid. We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification, and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing, the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple, connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences. NARRATIVE Conception failure and miscarriage affect millions of U.S. couples each year. This research uses new georeferenced data on pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy for 4 million U.S. women to provide the first evidence on individual, family, ecological, and policy factors that reduce the risk of early pregnancy failure.",Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S.,10143272,R01HD102207,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Couples ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fecundity ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Inflammation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' male ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Ovulation ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Rural Community ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Live Birth ', ' stillborn ', ' stillbirth ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' economic cost ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Consequentialism ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' Quasi-experimental analysis ', ' Quasi-experimental approach ', ' Quasi-experimental design ', ' Quasi-experimental methods ', ' Quasi-experimental research ', ' Quasi-experimental study ', ' Quasi-experimental technique ', ' Fertility Study ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' pregnant ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Data Science ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' tribal lands ', ' recruit ', ' early pregnancy ', ' prepregnancy ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' pregnancy failure ', ' failed pregnancy ', ' trying to conceive ', ' social factors ', ' data tools ', ' pregnancy health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,292268
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse.

"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and

"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' resilience ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Outcome ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' loved ones ', ' effective intervention ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' care giver well-being ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' social relationships ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states.

Abstract/Project summary E-cigarettes are a big problem among high school students – with rates of daily use exploding from 12% in 2017 to 28% in 2019. Adolescents are exposed to e-cigarette endorsements from social media influencers who promote these harmful products on behalf of e-cigarette brands as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes. This project proposes to comprehensively describe e-cigarette influencer marketing on Instagram (the most widely used platform for e-cigarette influencers) and on other social media platforms popular among U.S. teenagers; to examine associations between exposure to social media marketing and patterns of initiation and change in e-cigarette use; and to explore youth attitudes and ideas related to e-cigarette influencers and e- cigarette prevention campaigns. For Aim 1, we will use innovative, validated deep-learning models - a form of artificial intelligence that automatically discovers patterns in data - to evaluate trends in marketing themes and compliance with federal requirements for warning labels and sponsorship disclosures in e-cigarette promotional images and videos on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok to be collected from 2021 to 2023 (over four million posts, in all). We will use ANOVA tests to examine temporal trends in user engagement with e-cigarette marketing posts and compare the proportion of underaged users among followers of e-cigarette influencers on these platforms over the two-year period. For Aim 2, we will measure the association of exposure to e-cigarette marketing (on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat) with subsequent initiation, escalation or cessation of e-cigarette use among a socioeconomically- and racially-diverse cohort of 5,000 high school students living in urban areas of Southern California via ongoing longitudinal cohort surveys (2021-2023). We will use three waves of survey data in multilevel multinomial logistic regression to measure changes in exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat; we will use repeated-measures random effects logistic regression models to evaluate the association of exposure to marketing content on these platforms with subsequent changes in e-cigarette use. Ten focus groups among survey participants will complement survey findings and will be analyzed using the Grounded Theory method. Using the social media data, surveys and focus groups, we will also quantify and characterize the level of exposure to- and perception of anti-e-cigarette prevention campaigns on social media. This project will be the first to thoroughly evaluate changes in e-cigarette use habits among youth as a result of exposure to e-cigarette marketing and interaction with e-cigarette influencers on the most popular social media platforms among adolescents. Project Narrative Despite federal regulations, influencers continue to promote e-cigarette products on Instagram and other social media platforms popular among teenagers such as TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. This will be the first study to comprehensively evaluate user engagement with e-cigarette influencers, changes in youth e-cigarette use resulting from exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing content, trends in e-cigarette marketing themes, and compliance with federal regulations for e-cigarette warning labels and sponsorship disclosures. Our findings will allow us to inform regulators about the influence of social media promotional strategies on youth susceptibility to e-cigarettes to help design future public health e-cigarette prevention campaigns that can counter e-cigarette marketing.",Evaluating the impact of e-cigarette social media marketing on e-cigarette use among underage youth.,10218998,R01CA260459,"['Advertising ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' ANOVA ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Federal Trade Commission ', ' Federal Trade Commission ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' cigarette warning label ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data sharing ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' secondary analysis ', ' combustible cigarette ', ' conventional cigarette ', ' traditional cigarette ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' deep learning ', ' e-cigarette cessation ', ' e-cig cessation ', ' ecig cessation ', ' quitting e-cigarettes ', ' quitting e-cigs ', ' quitting ecigarettes ', ' quitting ecigs ', ' warning label ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,472796
"Neuro-computational mechanisms of social learning and variation along psychiatric symptom dimensions and in autism PROJECT SUMMARY Social learning is key for acquiring knowledge about the world and for deciding how to act in social situations. By allowing individuals to learn the consequences of actions in the environment without having to directly experience them, social learning abilities are evolutionary advantageous. Yet they vary widely across individuals, and deficits are common in a number of disorders associated with impaired social function, such autism spectrum disorders. Autism affect nearly 2% of births in the US, and exhibits high comorbidity with other disorders, such as social anxiety. Symptoms in common include social withdrawal and difficulties navigating social interactions, and can cause challenges during clinical assessments and treatment decisions. To address these challenges, we need to provide a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying deficits in social function. This project aims to do so by developing a novel task battery assessing multiple aspects of social learning and an integrative neuro-computational framework dissecting the underlying mechanisms, both in the general population, in relation to symptom dimensions relevant to psychopathology (such as social anxiety), and in individuals with autism. During the K99 phase of the award, under the mentorship of Dr. John O’Doherty at Caltech, the candidate will receive training in advanced computational methods (with Dr. Yisong Yue), and in biological and clinical psychiatry (with Dr. Ralph Adolphs and Dr. Jamie Feusner). In Aim 1, the candidate will establish a hierarchical computational modelling framework to characterize social learning across a battery of three tasks - observational learning, social integration and dynamic trust learning. In Aim 2, a trans-diagnostic approach will be used in a large-scale online study to link individual differences in social learning computations with symptoms dimensions relevant to psychopathology, particularly autistic traits and social anxiety. During the R00 phase of the award, the candidate will combine her computational and psychiatry training to investigate social learning in individuals with autism and matched controls. Participants will complete the social learning task battery both behaviorally (Aim 3) and while undergoing fMRI (Aim 4). This will determine the task battery’s test-retest reliability, and identify social learning computations that are altered in autism and those that vary along relevant symptom dimensions identified in Aim 2. The fMRI findings will illuminate the neural computations and functional connectivity patterns associated with social learning and their alterations in autism. Using cutting-edge computational modelling and neuroimaging methods, this project will refine our understanding of social dysfunction and will contribute methodological and conceptual innovations to advance the burgeoning field of computational psychiatry. In the long term, such computational characterization of psychiatric deficits has the potential to inform policies and clinical interventions to improve social function. This Pathway to Independence award will allow the candidate to reach her training and research goals, form new collaborations, and overall paves the way for a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to characterize the neuro-computational mechanisms that drive human social learning, and their alterations in relation to trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions relevant to psychopathology. Social learning computations will be examined both in the general population and in autism, a neuro-developmental disorder known to be associated with deficits in social function. In the long run, this research has the potential to inform the development of more tailored clinical assessments and interventions to improve social function in mental health.",Neuro-computational mechanisms of social learning and variation along psychiatric symptom dimensions and in autism,10216053,K99MH123669,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Belief ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Policies ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' news ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Transact ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social group ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' social situation ', ' social anxiety ', ' cognitive ability ', ' social learning ', ' social media ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' autistic ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,97332
"Predicting and Preventing Gun Violence: An Evaluation of READI Chicago Abstract Young Black men are 20 times as likely to be fatally shot than their White counterparts, and more lose their lives to homicide than the next nine leading causes of death combined (CDC 2020). Chicago, which saw homicides spike by over 50% in 2016 and 2020, is a stark example of this problem: over 90% of cases involved a firearm. As in many cities, the victims are overwhelmingly young Black men from a handful of disadvantaged neighborhoods. Despite the extremely high social cost generated by this kind of violence, few interventions have considered the effectiveness of finding those most likely to be involved in shootings, and providing them with economic, behavioral, and personal support services instead of more law enforcement. This project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a new intervention for men at the highest risk of gun violence, designed to test a behaviorally-informed, social service-based approach. The Rapid Employment and Development Initiative (READI) identifies men in Chicago at the highest risk of being involved in a shooting via three methods: machine learning predictions based on administrative arrest and victimization records; referrals from street outreach staff working in the communities served; and screening among those leaving prison and jail. READI then provides 18 months of supported, subsidized work alongside cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and personal development programming. READI builds on evidence from prior RCTs of CBT- based programming that find it can dramatically reduce violence and other criminal behavior (Blattman et al., 2017; Heller et al., 2017), suggesting it may be possible to reduce the most socially costly forms of violence without incurring the collateral costs of stepped-up law enforcement efforts. Over three years, 2,456 men were randomly assigned either to a treatment group offered READI or a control group free to pursue other available services. This is the largest RCT of an individual-level gun violence intervention conducted to date. The study’s primary goal is to measure impact results on serious violence involvement and other criminal behavior using administrative arrest and victimization records. The rich data sources and experimental design also gives us the opportunity to learn how well each of the recruitment methods anticipates actual shooting and violence involvement. Since there could be a trade-off between a participant’s risk level and their responsiveness to treatment, we will also analyze what the variation in risk, take-up rates, and program impacts across recruitment methods teach us about socially optimal targeting. Lastly, we will combine impact results, qualitative data collection, and a benefit-cost comparison to draw out broader policy implications about cities’ efforts to address the enormous social costs of serious violence. Project Narrative Intentional gun violence injures or kills 170 people a day in the U.S., with young Black men over 20 times as likely to die as White men of the same age. Despite gun violence’s enormous health and social costs, there is little settled evidence on effective strategies to prevent shooting and homicide involvement—especially ones that avoid the social costs of stepped-up law enforcement. Our randomized experiment aims to provide such evidence by first identifying those at highest risk for gun violence and then testing the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral-informed social service intervention designed to reduce their involvement in shootings and other serious violence.",Predicting and Preventing Gun Violence: An Evaluation of READI Chicago,10400479,R01MD017194,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Firearms ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' Illinois ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' falls ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Nongovernmental Organizations ', ' Non-governmental Organizations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' authority ', ' City Government ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' peace ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' parole ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' gun violence ', ' firearm violence ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' high risk ', ' policy implication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' screening ', ' treatment group ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' gun homicide ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' black men ', ' black male ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,1867461
"Progressive social withdrawal in trauma-exposed older adolescents and young adults: neurocircuitry predictors Social withdrawal is a transdiagnostic phenotype that is strongly associated with detrimental physical and mental health outcomes across the lifespan. As quantified using structural features of individuals’ social networks, social withdrawal is associated with 60-70% increased mortality and a threefold increase in suicide risk. Recent findings document associations between trauma-related psychopathology and altered social network structural features, including size, density, diversity, and embeddedness. Critically, because the transition to adulthood (age 16-20) is a period of rapid expansion in social networks, forms of psychopathology that produce social withdrawal may confer particular risk for poor outcomes during this developmental stage. Thus, the transition to adulthood is a key developmental period for the evolution of social withdrawal in trauma- exposed populations. Recent literature indicates that social reward processing may drive social network size and complexity, but the role of disrupted social reward functioning in driving progressive social withdrawal following trauma exposure is poorly understood. Using an innovative longitudinal design including digital phenotyping of social behavior, the proposed study will investigate activity and connectivity within brain regions that bidirectionally code for social approach and avoidance, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The hypothesis is that BLA-VMPFC- NAcc functional connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood following interpersonal trauma exposure. We will enroll 120 trauma-exposed participants (ages 16- 20) who endorse posttraumatic and/or depressive symptoms, and 60 healthy controls. Trauma-exposed participants will be stratified for baseline self-reported social anhedonia. We obtain baseline social withdrawal measures, including active self-reports of social interaction and passive smartphone based phenotyping of activity via accelerometer, GPS, and call/text metadata. Participants will complete an fMRI scan to obtain measures of BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity, followed by one year of digital phenotyping using active and passive data to measure social withdrawal. Based on our extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1) baseline social withdrawal will be associated with baseline BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity; (2) baseline BLA- VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal over the course of a 12- month follow-up; (3) predictive models of social withdrawal that include BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will outperform alternate models. The proposed integrated approach (fMRI, digital phenotyping) will identify specific circuitry associated with progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood, and will develop predictive algorithms that forecast social withdrawal trajectories based on baseline connectivity within BLA- VMPFC-NAcc circuitry. Ultimately this work could lead to the development of targeted interventions (e.g. neurofeedback), and may shift the field toward reward-circuitry accounts of social withdrawal. Individuals with a history of interpersonal trauma exposure are at risk for progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood (ages 16-20), and although social withdrawal is strongly associated with detrimental health outcomes, neurobiological processes that contribute to social withdrawal following trauma exposure have not been identified. In line with NIMH Objective 2.2 (Identify and understand risk factors, biomarkers, and behavioral indicators of mental illnesses and of intervention responses across the lifespan), in the short term this study will: (1) identify how connectivity within a specified neural circuit is associated with baseline social withdrawal as well as change in social withdrawal over time, and (2) develop predictive algorithms that can forecast future social withdrawal based on baseline connectivity within the circuit. In the long term, understanding how connectivity within this circuit contributes to progressive social withdrawal may contribute to the development of interventions that target this circuit (e.g. neurofeedback) and may shift the field toward emphasizing the role of reward processing abnormalities in contributing to social withdrawal in trauma-exposed individuals.",Progressive social withdrawal

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection

"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Crying ', ' Dancing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hunger ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Infant ', ' Methodology ', ' Study models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' Infant Behavior ', ' Tadpoles ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' neurogenetics ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' sensory integration ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' social ', ' social bonding ', ' social attachment ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' in vivo ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neuron development ', ' neuronal development ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' feeding ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' brain behavior ', ' parent grant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' black women ', ' black female ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Argipressin ', ' Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Vasopressin-Neurophysin II-Copeptin ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Middle Hypothalamus ', ' Intermediate Hypothalamic Region ', ' Medial Hypothalamus ', ' Locales ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Vasopressins ', ' Antidiuretic Hormone ', ' beta-Hypophamine ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Source ', ' extracellular ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' motivated behavior ', ' maternal aggression ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' presynaptic ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' optogenetics ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,10232054,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Bite ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Lions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Upper arm ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' haptics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' robotic system ', ' assistive robot ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,68562
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,10085684,R34MH119170,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Anxiety ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Body Weight ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' restraint ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' impression ', ' self help ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' feeling distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' emotional distress ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parental involvement ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' social media ', ' reduced food intake ', ' eat less ', ' reduced eating ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' service delivery ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' digital health ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,232006
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Institution ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Authorization ', ' Permission ', ' Text ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' safety net ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' social health determinants ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' data access ', ' incentive program ', ' incentive-based program ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' postoperative recovery ', ' post-operative recovery ', ' recovery after surgery ', ' recovery following surgery ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,750022
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Health Campaign ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' health communication ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' network models ', ' Regimen ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' social media ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' Self-Direction ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' social relationships ', ' virtual coach ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235
"THS: Using Twitter and Big Data Analytics to Track and Predict Health Conditions Project Summary/Abstract U.S. health officials are struggling to keep up with information and misinformation related to health conditions, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks affecting communities nationwide. Early warnings about such events can be found in public postings made by citizens using social networks like Twitter. However, the sheer volume of messages posted each day, and the real possibility of false content makes it very difficult to rely on these data for guidance, education, and decision making. Deep learning and big data solutions could be used to tackle this problem by providing the means to collect, classify, and validate these messages, sorting out actionable data from noise. But deep learning models are hard to train and tune, requiring data sets with thousands of examples. Our long-term goal is to understand how to build, deploy, and maintain an integrated and scalable platform to search social media posts and analyze their contents in search for clues about health conditions. In this project, our overall objective is to develop the technology needed to integrate search queries and deep learning models that are run against social media data to detect conversations that can throw clues about emerging topics, determine the intent of the messages (e.g., opinion, advise), and to find and group together individual messages that are similar in content. Our central hypothesis is that we can reduce query time for message search, increase classifier accuracy and precision for health topic detection, and simplify model training and deployment through the use of transfer learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and similarity-search models based on neural networks. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop supervised methods to support accurate message similarity search. We shall use Siamese neural networks to compute a similarity score between tweets and rank them according to this score. In Specific Aim 2 we will implement data augmentation via GANs to improve model training time and accuracy. Our GANs will generate synthetic tweets that are realistic enough to help users produce good training data with less manual effort and yet produce well-trained models. As a proof of concept, we shall harden our existing open-source THS system by adding these capabilities. Our project is novel because THS is the first system of its kind, providing a “social data warehouse” to collect, store, integrate, index, and analyze Twitter data in an open source platform. Its significance stems from the ability to work as a tool to help health officials analyze tweets, visualize data along disease and spatio-temporal attributes, and make predictive analytics, all under one roof. This could have a significant impact on public health disease tracking and response. UPRM is a Hispanic serving institution, with the second largest Hispanic serving engineering school in the U.S. and with 35% female enrollment. This project provides a unique opportunity to train students in social media analysis, big data systems, and machine learning. The success of this project could open new opportunities for UPRM researchers to participate in collaborative NIH proposals with other institutions.

"Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism Abstract This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics (e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill, and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together, these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy. These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc- cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD. Project Narrative At the most basic level, social communication boils down to what you say and what you do while interacting with other people. Problems with social communication affect individuals with ASD throughout their lives, but expensive and time-consuming measurement tools have hindered the development of effective treatments for this core challenge. In this proposal, we aim to improve clinical characterization and diagnostic decision- making in ASD and other psychiatric conditions by digitizing human vocal interaction and using advanced machine learning techniques to fuse audio-video signals into an autism-specific algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for future precision medicine efforts and advancing the state of public health.",Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism,10165685,R01DC018289,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Individual ', ' Furuncles ', ' Boils ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic association ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' natural language ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' cognitive process ', ' Genetic study ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' data fusion ', ' learning classifier ', ' motor behavior ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' ']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,595521
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools.

"Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African American women (SELA) ABSTRACT Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is a prototypic autoimmune disease marked by a disproportionate prevalence and severity burden in women of African ancestry (AA). There is a critical need for efforts that identify the molecular mechanisms through which positive and negative social determinants of health contribute to the lupus health disparity, so that progress in improving disease outcomes can be made and the health disparities gap can be closed. This research project addresses the objectives of PAR-19-372 to “1) advance understanding of mechanisms by which social factors lead to epigenetic changes that affect minority health and health disparities, and 2) promote epigenetics research to better predict disease or resiliency among health disparity populations.” We are seeking to identify and characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and negative social experiences affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in AA women. We have previously shown that racial discrimination is associated with worse disease outcomes in AA women, while social support seems to have a positive impact. Multiple environmental exposures, including psychosocial factors, affect variation in DNA methylation. Despite their influence on SLE in AA women, it is not known how environmental experiences affect and operate through the individual epigenome to influence disease. We will test the following hypotheses in AA women: 1) exposure to adverse and protective social contexts is associated with epigenomic changes involving immune, inflammatory, and energy metabolism pathways, which in turn are associated with disease outcomes; and 2) social support compensates for the detrimental, independent effect of racial discrimination on SLE through epigenetic and gene regulatory mechanisms. We will leverage our existing registry and infrastructure, together with our community partnership, to accomplish this community-engaged integrative mechanistic study. We will enroll 300 AA women with SLE and 300 unaffected AA women, collect sociodemographic, medical, genotypic, leukocyte proportion, DNA methylation, and gene expression data, and use validated measures to assess life course racial discrimination and social support. We propose to: identify variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with (a) exposure to racial discrimination, (b) exposure to social support, and (c) epigenetic age acceleration (Aim 1); to assess whether social DNAm sites affect gene expression (Aim 2); and identify the synergistic effects of social factors on DNAm changes on SLE and develop a social factors-DNAm predictive model for disease outcomes (Aim 3). This will be the first study investigating epigenetic mechanisms by which risk and resiliency factors affect gene function and lupus in AA women. These results will greatly expand the knowledge of how social factors affect gene function, disease outcomes, and health disparities, which might inform the development of effective interventions to close the health disparities gap. Finally, given the shared etiologic mechanisms, these findings have broader applicability to other autoimmune diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies, disproportionately affecting women and African Americans, with whom it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, and without safe and effective treatments. This project seeks to identify and characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and negative social experiences affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in African American women. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it could lead to improvements in our understanding of the etiology of SLE and its disparities, facilitating the development of targeted precision medicine approaches to reduce morbidity, mortality, and close the health disparities gap.","Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African American women (SELA)",10299857,R01MD015395,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity -

This phase will start with conceptual research and normative analysis of the ELSI issues related to data science. Important concepts to explore will include data sovereignty where data protection is balanced with responsible data sharing. Given that digital data is often experienced as intangible and abstract by the lay public, the project will employ crowdsourcing as a form of citizen science to inform the development of innovative educational tools that could be adapted for stakeholder engagement in data science in the DS-I Africa network. Using these tools, we will conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain their experiences with ELSI-data science related challenges, gaps in current guidance and their views on procedural and substantive aspects of guidance development in data science governance. Key themes that emerge from the empirical research will underpin our approach to co-creation of guidelines, procedures and policies required in the DS-I Africa consortium. During phase 1, ethics consultants embedded in the Research Hubs will address emerging ELSI concerns. In Phase 2 of this project, we will develop guidance documents informed by phase 1 research and by best practices in international data science research guidance, the limited experience and existing literature to date concerning data science research and governance of data management in Southern Africa. Importantly, such guidance will be informed by the values of solidarity, sharing and mutual benefit - important concepts in Southern African moral frameworks based on communal good. This approach is congruent with health data ecosystems that require different stakeholders to work collaboratively for health innovation. The results of these policy-related activities will be tempered with key concerns and principles identified in our conceptual and empirical work and will provide locally grounded, practical guidance on the ELSI of data science research conducted in the hubs. In Phase 3 of the project, we aim to amplify the impact and enhance the sustainability of our research and governance activities by creating ELSI networks and communication channels focusing on data science in Southern Africa. This will involve establishing an ELSI Data Science Southern African Network (EDSSAN) to respond to evolving ELSI concerns in DS-I Africa Research Hubs beyond the funding period, hosting annual conferences, and leveraging existing local networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE Southern Africa faces numerous public health challenges due to the high prevalence of communicable and non- communicable diseases. For this reason, innovative public health research, such as data science (or ‘big data’) approaches, are crucial to promote population health and reduce health inequality. The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project will explore the ethical, legal and social implications of the Harnessing Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa (DS-I Africa) initiative by conducting empirical, conceptual and normative research, and developing contextualized evidence-based guidance with the overall aim of enhancing the governance of data science research for health promotion in southern Africa.",Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA),10310553,U01MH127704,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Ethical Analysis ', ' Ethical Analyses ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Social Sciences ', ' South Africa ', ' Transfer Agreement ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Protection ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' commune ', ' Ethics Consultation ', ' Structure ', ' solidarity ', ' Devices ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Project Summaries ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' public trust ', ' public health ethics ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' public health intervention ', ' health data ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' data access ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' deep learning ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' data framework ', ' data literacy ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY TYGERBERG CAMPUS,U01,2021,400000
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment.

"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated,

"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Coca ', ' Erythroxylon ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities, machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of racial disparities in birth outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individual-level risk factors are not fully explaining the large and persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, limiting policy and intervention strategies to reduce these disparities.

"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,10084718,R01MH119430,"['absorption ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eyebrow structure ', ' Eyebrows ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Oxyhemoglobin ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smiling ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' deoxyhemoglobin ', ' T-state hemoglobin ', ' de-oxyhemoglobin ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' mimicry ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Head Movements ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' magnetic field ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' contagion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' neural correlate ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,399738
"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican

"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,10120523,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' age group ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive mood ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' early adolescence ', ' Social Processes ', ' graph theory ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,584996
"Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD. Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model- based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g. face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant, interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1) hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD- relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular, we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically- driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets. Project Narrative Despite social deficits being core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contributing to relationship difficulties and low employment rates, their neurobiological underpinnings are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about the brain mechanisms underlying social deficits in autism using computational modeling, novel brain imaging tools, and interactive experimental tasks that simulate dynamic social interactions.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",10252758,R01AG026291,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Disability Insurance ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Occupational ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' disability impact ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,713126
"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,10238134,K01MH118477,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Boston ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' early onset ', ' digital ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' patient population ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' bipolar patients ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' learning network ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' data access ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' data streams ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,141124
"Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority populations Abstract Vulnerable and underserved populations such as ethnic and racial minorities, the poor, the LGBTQ community and those with physical or intellectual disabilities, often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers to receiving healthcare. While biological and clinical risks influence outcomes, sociocultural and socioeconomic factors also create major barriers to receiving healthcare services, at an individual, community and population level for these populations. These social determinants of health (SDOH), such as transportation, literacy, and finances can severely limit participation in health programs designed for the general population. Diabetes Prevention Programs are a good example of a lifestyle change protocol that is proven to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by half for pre-diabetics patients at risk by encouraging weight-loss. But, despite the effectiveness of the program, more than 50% of participants drop out before completing this year-long lifestyle change program, severely limiting the program’s success. This is in part due to the fact that programs like DPP take little account of the limitations faced by underserved and vulnerable populations that it is meant to help. This lack of support at the individual and community level combined with the fact that healthcare institutions are not designed for, nor economical, in supporting patient health outside the medical facility where it is most needed. This creates a gap in healthcare service that current systems cannot overcome. Viora is closing this health services gap with a system that interfaces between the health care system, the underserved patient, and underutilized community-based resources and providers, to facilitate better outcomes in programs like DPP. By using risk stratification based on SDOH factors, each DPP participant can have tailored interventions that consider their socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics. The Viora Health system connects patients to local resources using simple communication between the patient, health providers, and community services, facilitating patient completion of the DPP program, thereby improving health outcomes. In Phase I, Viora will evaluate a larger set of pre-diabetes and SDOH risk factors across 5000 minority and underserved subjects to select the most relevant variables for risk assessment and personal prevention plan development. The system will automatically screen pre-diabetic participants who are eligible, ready and able to adhere to DPP, and will create a personalized intervention plan that is the most impactful in reducing their risk but is also doable. The system’s communication network will be expanded to provide direct communication between the patient, DPP coach, health providers and community resources, to support the participant toward maintaining their DPP goals. Finally, the project will assess the basic function of the system, preferences and human interaction in a human subject study with underserved subjects and community-based partners. Completion of Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of our software system incorporating major components of the VIORA SYSTEM, which will inform the development of a minimum viable product to be tested in Phase 2. Narrative Vulnerable and underserved populations often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant barriers, largely due to social and behavioral factors that hinder continued participation in disease prevention and management protocols. Viora Health’s system will have significant public health impact in scaling evidence- based protocols by using technology to identify such factors and leverage existing community based resources to support patients in mitigating these factors.","Automated system for risk determinantion, facilitation and community support to mitigate social determinants of health in minority

"Disrupted neural synchrony during naturalistic perception in schizophrenia: Toward a new biomarker of social dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Social dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia. Many individuals with schizophrenia experience social disconnection, a lack of social contact with friends and family. Social disconnection is associated with reduced quality of life and many negative health effects, but most current treatments do little to address it. The development of new interventions is currently hindered by a lack of scientific understanding about how differences in the way individuals’ brains process information contribute to social disconnection, and a lack of biomarkers associated with social functioning. Recent research in non-clinical social neuroscience points to a compelling model that may help to explain social disconnection in schizophrenia and would provide the basis for a new biomarker of social dysfunction. Specifically, research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis methods shows that people whose brains tend to respond more normatively to dynamic, naturalistic stimuli (e.g., video clips) tend to have more social connections, perhaps because more other people experience the world in a similar way, whereas people with less normative responses tend to have fewer social connections. Converging evidence suggests that many individuals with schizophrenia are likely to have less normative responses to such naturalistic stimuli, which could help to explain why social disconnection is common in the disorder. However, the ISC method has not yet been used to study social dysfunction in schizophrenia. This project will fill this research gap by translating ISC research methods from non-clinical research in order to investigate how ISCs relate to social disconnection in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia (N=200) and matched healthy controls (N=100) will each complete one fMRI scan during which they will view naturalistic video stimuli and complete two established paradigms that assess important domains of social processing: social cue perception and mentalizing. We will characterize ISCs based on responses to the naturalistic video stimuli and characterize brain activity related to social cue perception and mentalizing using standard analyses. The study will test whether ISCs differ between the two participant groups and evaluate to what extent group ISC differences relate to individual differences in social connection. We will also characterize ISC normativity for each member of the schizophrenia group, using the control group as a reference, to assess whether brain response normativity is associated with social disconnection, and whether individuals’ degree of social disconnection can be predicted from it. The project will also test whether an ISC-based measure is more sensitive to individual differences in social disconnection than established fMRI measures. Results from this project will improve understanding of how brain activity relates to social dysfunction in schizophrenia. ISC measures are also expected to constitute a biomarker of social dysfunction that may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of social disconnection, targeting treatments toward individuals most likely to benefit from them, or assessing outcomes in future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will advance understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is a core feature of the disorder that is associated with reduced quality of life and many negative health outcomes. By applying a novel research technique from non-clinical social neuroscience, this study will characterize specific relationships between patterns of brain activity and degree of social disconnection in schizophrenia. This new method is expected to yield a biomarker of social dysfunction in schizophrenia, which may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of social disconnection, targeting treatments toward individuals most likely to benefit from them, or assessing outcomes in future clinical trials.",Disrupted neural synchrony during naturalistic perception in schizophrenia: Toward a new biomarker of social dysfunction,10345552,R01MH128720,"['Affect ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' foot ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' social ', ' social bonding ', ' social attachment ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' LBUL ', ' Lobule ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' treatment trial ', ' Social Functioning ', ' social neuroscience ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' high risk ', ' information processing ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Major Mental Illness ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,752235
"Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of suicide, self-harm, and depression are alarmingly high among adolescent girls, with a dramatic spike over the last decade, yet it is not clear which girls are at highest risk for these serious problems and when they might escalate. Some have argued that the dramatic rise in social media (SM) use may play a role, but more rigorous data are needed to evaluate the positive and negative effects of SM use in adolescent girls. Sensitivity to social evaluation, such as rejection or exclusion, is a potential cross-diagnostic risk factor for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB; including suicidal ideation and behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury) and de- pressive symptoms (DEPsx). This study examines how socially threatening and rewarding peer interactions— experienced online or in-person—contribute to real-time fluctuations in SITB, DEPsx, and well-being. The first aim is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify how adolescent girls’ daily subjective experi- ence of online and in-person social threat and reward predict proximal within-person changes and longer-term between-person differences in SITB and DEPsx, along with wellbeing. The sample will include 177 adolescent girls (ages 13-17), with 75% of the sample at high-risk for suicide (e.g. active ideation within past 6 weeks, at- tempt in past year, or ≥ five episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury in past year), with at least half of high-risk par- ticipants also reporting elevated DEPsx. Girls will complete three 10-day bursts of EMA and will also provide access to passively obtained data on SM use and digital social interactions (i.e. text, video-chat). Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify predictors of near-term changes in SITB, DEPsx, and positive affect (PA), as well as long-term outcomes assessed at 6- and 12-month follow-up. A second aim is to identify which girls are at highest risk for DEPsx and/or SITB when exposed to near-term precipitants, focusing on differences in brain activation to social evaluation within an affective salience network (ASN) that includes the amygdala, anterior insula, dorsal and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Building on the differ- ential susceptibility to context theory, the study proposes that heightened ASN activation to social evaluation is a susceptibility factor that could amplify both the positive and negative effects of daily social experience on SITB and DEPsx. Girls will complete neuroimaging tasks that assess brain response to social evaluation from virtual peers. It is hypothesized that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social threat experiences (online and in-person) will be most strongly associated with SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation, and that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social reward experi- ences will also be more strongly associated with PA/wellbeing and more protective against SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation. Finally, machine learning will be used to determine which objective features of SM use track in real-time with subjective experience and emotional health, and to identify the strongest set of predictors of short-term and long-term emotional health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Results from this study could help address the current mental health crisis among adolescent girls by leverag- ing real-time data to identify near-term risk factors that more optimally predict when girls will experience esca- lations in suicidality, as well as common earlier precursors to suicide such as nonsuicidal self-injury and de- pressive symptoms, and leveraging neuroimaging data to identify which girls may be at highest risk. This infor- mation is critical for improving real-time risk detection, designing just-in-time suicide prevention and inter- vention approaches, and accelerating the discovery of potential neural markers of risk and/or protection from these serious emotional health problems. Additionally, the study will provide rigorous empirical data on the real-time positive and negative links between social media use and adolescent emotional health that can inform public perceptions and policies surrounding social media use among adolescents.","Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls",10298070,R01MH124866,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Puberty ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Policies ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' video chat ', ' video conferencing ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' high risk ', ' non-suicidal self injury ', ' nonsuicidal self injury ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social media ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,837750
"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Courtship ', ' Cues ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Photometry ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Pupil ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Forebrain ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' analog ', ' zebra finch ', ' Finches ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Oscines ', ' song bird ', ' Songbirds ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' vocal learning ', ' Athletic ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Coupled ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' optogenetics ', ' social learning ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning outcome ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988
"“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment PROJECT SUMMARY The prenatal period is regarded as one of the most sensitive phases in human development. Events that occur during gestation can alter the course of development with lasting impact. Presently, the COVID-19 pandemic is exerting wide-spread impact on the lives of expectant mothers around the world. Particularly salient pandemic- related stressors that are being experienced by pregnant women are social isolation and uncertainty stress. There is ample physiological and behavioral literature showing that social isolation and uncertainty stress affect typical human and animal psychobiological functioning, but there is an absence of knowledge about how these conditions might impact the physical and psychological health of a pregnant woman, and what the consequences of those changes might be for her developing child. The central objective of this proposal is to build foundational knowledge about the effects of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal psychobiology and infant neurobehavior. We will explore several candidate physiological systems in the mother to elucidate mechanisms that underlie associations between maternal stressors and child outcomes. To achieve these goals, we will recruit 200 women from a large New York City cohort established at the height of the pandemic into a prospective, longitudinal study that will include pre- and postnatal biospecimen collection and child neurobehavioral assessments at 6-, 12- and 24 months. Multi-modal neuroimaging strategies, including infant EEG and quantitative MRI, and innovative remote biophysical data collection strategies will be employed. The primary aims of this project are to (i) examine the impact of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal biology and postnatal mental health; (ii) evaluate the influence of maternal prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on infant neurobehavioral development; and (iii) examine the role of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on mother-infant bi-directional interactions. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether, and how, prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress modify maternal biology and affect, and the neurobehavioral consequences of those impacts on infants. Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our understanding of the longitudinal effects of prenatal psychosocial stress exposures, the underlying mechanistic pathways, and the origins of child neurobehavioral disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Isolation, insecurity and uncertainty can impact the psychiatric health of pregnant mothers, with substantial lasting morbidity for mother and child. The goal of this project is to lay critical foundations for understanding the biological consequences of social isolation and uncertainty stress, and the roles they play in both maternal and child outcomes.",“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment,10231690,R01MH126468,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Environment ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -

"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games.

"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' analytical method ', ' sensor ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' drinking ', ' drink heavily ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' extreme drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk drinking ', ' at-risk drinking ', ' risky drinking ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' alcohol risk ', ' marijuana user ', ' cannabis user ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' marijuana use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' data streams ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' Longterm Potentiation ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Contralateral ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Long-Term Synaptic Depression ', ' longterm depression ', ' longterm synaptic depression ', ' Long-Term Depression ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' postnatal development ', ' post-natal development ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic Abstract Annually in the U.S., nearly 60,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM) with substantial health disparities by race/ethnicity, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has hit communities of color the hardest. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women who are pregnant appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. Questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in SMMM and the dynamics and interactions of multilevel determinants such as broader social contexts of SMMM remain unanswered. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM), the contributing roles and mediating pathways of social contexts (e.g., residential segregation, racial discrimination in poverty, education, unemployment, and home ownership), and their long-standing health consequences postpartum. We will achieve our goal by studying the distributions of COVID-19 cases and multilevel determinants of maternal health in South Carolina (SC), a state with persistent racial disparities in SMMM within historical systemic Southern contexts, and in the U.S. We will build upon our existing statewide SC COVID-19 Cohort (S3C) by creating a pregnancy cohort that will link COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHR), and birth certificate data for all births in SC in 2019-2020. To ensure the generalizability of our findings, we will confirm them using EHR data from the ongoing National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Nationwide social context databases and time-varying COVID-19 severity and social distancing policies will be added to S3C and N3c data. We will use the socio-ecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed methods study design to achieve three specific aims: 1) to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM; 2) to examine and explore how the key features of social contexts have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in MMM during the pandemic (Aim 2a) and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health (Aim 2b); and 3) to examine the role of social contextual factors and identify protective factors for racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related, long-standing morbidities using machine learning algorithms. For Aim 2b, a convergent parallel design will be used, which includes a quantitative analysis of data from SC PRAMS and qualitative interviews of postpartum women (20 Black, 20 Hispanics) and 10 maternal care providers. Our experienced team is well positioned to investigate the complexity of racial disparities in MMM during the COVID-19 pandemic, while considering historical structural racism in a racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse population of pregnant women. A rigorous examination of social contexts on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM and mental health during the pandemic will inform continuing efforts to reverse the rising trends of SMMM in the U.S. Our proposal addresses Areas 1, 2, & 4 in the NOT-OD-21-071. Narrative Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal disruptions to individuals, communities, healthcare institutions, and society as a whole, it has hit communities of color the hardest. Empirical data on the scope of widening racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality and how historical structural racism and discrimination of all types have impacted women of color disproportionally are sparse. This study will be among the first to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic, structural racism, and racial discrimination– exposures with broad scale and reach – have contributed to the racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in

"Prototype for an online skills-based drug prevention program targeting youth 11-13 PROJECT ABSTRACT Drug prevention programs that migrate to the web are interactive, but mostly fail to engage youth and maximize program exposure. An alternative approach considers gamification with animated sequences and uses machine learning algorithms based on Markov Decision Processes to stimulate youths’ curiosity, engage them in a real-world scenario that requires real-time strategic thinking. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose to design, build, and test an alpha prototype for Skills-Based Learning (SBL) Online, a fully gamified drug abuse prevention program. Gamification studies now conclusively show that youth can and do learn from playing videogames, particularly when they feel immersed in the game, maintain high levels of curiosity, and form a social identity or close attachment to the characters in the game. Programs also stimulate learning when they provide scaffolding, using guiding, coaching, and modeling that help youth master skills and advance to new challenge levels. In addition, the game has to be responsive to the player, incorporate their in- game behavior, and tailor play to their skill levels as opposed to delivering a prefixed program. When these elements of a videogame come together, they have been shown to stimulate higher order thinking and problem-solving skills that have value in the real-world. We propose to blend instructional design principles with state-of-the-art gamification using machine learning algorithms to create a realistic animated game that teaches decision-making, problem-solving, and social skills. The game involves animation, brief video vignettes, non-playing characters, and a personalized pedagogical agent (an avatar) to guide youth through a simulated environment that presents them with realistic social interactional challenges. The program targets youth in early adolescence (ages 11 to 13), a period when they face numerous developmental challenges that when successfully negotiated helps them crystallize an identity. Shifting tides of influence from parents to peers, seeking emotional independence and greater autonomy plus the adoption of formal operational reasoning are a few of the many factors that fuel “storm and stress” during adolescence. This Phase I application will coalesce the strengths of prevention and computer scientists to build and test an alpha prototype of SBL Online. The study combines formative evaluation using focus groups to learn more about the nature of youths’ social interactions, the settings in which they encounter peer pressure, their perceptions of risky behavior, future orientation, and problem-solving skills they employ to offset life’s pressures. Usability testing iteratively covers early and later build phases, plus active playtesting using think-aloud techniques. A second thrust involves obtaining input from key stakeholders (middle school teachers, youth service providers) to ascertain the program’s developmental and cultural appropriateness and commercial potential. The technology partner (3C) has an extensive acumen building and commercializing social emotional learning- based health-related applications for children and youth including projects with the investigators. NARRATIVE  Adolescent drug use, including the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana, remain significant health and social problems that require the development of effective preventive strategies. This research advances game-based learning with an online drug prevention program that can be delivered alone or in conjunction with other classroom-based instructional strategies. Moreover, this intervention combines emerging instructional design and learning theories in combination with evidence-based prevention science to create a fun, engaging, and immersive

"Circuit basis of social behavior decision-making in a subcortical network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an FOA (RFA-NS-18-030) calling for 1) “novel approaches to understand neural circuitry associated with well-defined social behaviors;” 2) Distributed circuits that contribute to the coordination of motivational states and reward behavior;” 3) “Empirical and analytical approaches to understand how behavioral states are emergent properties of the interaction of neurons, circuits and networks.” The study of subcortical circuits that control conserved, naturalistic behaviors is crucial to understanding brain function. We aim to understand how dynamic interactions between different circuit nodes in the Hypothalamic-Extended Amygdala Decision (“HEAD”) network control innate social behavior decisions, e.g., between aggressive and reproductive behaviors. We propose an integrated approach to this problem that combines microendoscopic imaging (MEI) of genetically identified neuronal subpopulations with automated, machine learning-based classification of social behavior in freely moving mice, together with functional perturbations of neuronal activity in vivo. Our broad, long-term objective is to understand how distributed activity among interconnected structures in the HEAD network controls moment-to-moment decisions between competing goal-directed behaviors that are crucial for the survival of animals and humans. The central objective of this proposal is to understand how information flows through this network during social interactions, and is decoded to control the decision to engage in reproductive vs. aggressive social behaviors. To understand how activity in “upstream” nodes controls neural representations in “downstream” nodes, we will implement a novel approach combining reversible chemogenetic inhibition of the former with concurrent imaging of neuronal population activity in the latter. The rationale for this approach is that an understanding of the system requires characterizing the effects of functional manipulations on both behavioral and circuit-level phenotypes. To achieve our objective, we will first characterize the neural coding of behavior and conspecific sex identity in multiple nodes of the extended amygdala, using single-site microendoscopic imaging and computational analytic approaches (Aim 1); determine how perturbations in the activity of such nodes influence representations in hypothalamic nodes (Aim 2); investigate the roles of intra- and inter-nuclear interactions in determining the balance of activity between aggression and reproduction-promoting hypothalamic nodes (Aim 3); determine how this balance is decoded by downstream mid-brain structures to determine the type of social behavior to express (Aim 4). This contribution is significant because it represents a systems-level approach to understanding how a subcortical network controls behavioral decision-making. The contribution is innovative because it integrates analysis of neuronal population activity, quantitative measurement of naturalistic social behavior and functional perturbations of activity in specific neuronal subpopulations to gain insight into how distributed neural circuits control survival behaviors, in a context that is relevant to maladaptations causing human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is aimed at developing and applying new approaches to understanding how mammalian subcortical brain circuits control evolutionarily conserved naturalistic social behaviors, which may be disrupted in human psychiatric disorders. Our objective is to construct better, high-resolution maps of neural activity dynamics in the brain during social behavior, by imaging from multiple brain sites in a circuit, and using machine learning algorithms (AI) to automatically extract and measure social behavior from video recordings, thereby enabling precise, quantitative correlations between distributed brain activity and behavior. We also propose to examine how intruder sex and behavioral decisions are computed and transformed as they are propagated through the network.",Circuit basis of social behavior decision-making in a subcortical network,10300937,R01NS123916,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Decision Making ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Logic ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Preoptic Areas ', ' preoptic region ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproduction ', ' Reproductive Behavior ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' reproductive ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,675363
"SOCRATES: SOCial Risk and diAbetes ouTcomEs Study ABSTRACT  Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, are associated with poor outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In particular, these factors are associated with worse glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol control, which significantly increases the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. They are also key drivers of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status-based disparities in diabetes outcomes. Thus, there is a growing call for interventions to address these needs and improve T2DM outcomes. However little research has assessed whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in T2DM outcomes.  This knowledge gap hampers efforts to develop effective interventions. Addressing it will provide much- needed evidence on which patients to screen for which social needs, and on which interventions targeting social needs are most likely to improve T2DM outcomes. The pathways linking social needs and T2DM outcomes are likely characterized by interactions between individual- (e.g., needs, age, gender, race/ethnicity), clinic- (e.g., clinic characteristics; specifics of the intervention), and area-level factors (e.g., local economic conditions; community resources). Given this complexity, a multi-pronged approach is needed. We will combine 3 methods of investigation: 1) longitudinal, multi-level, regression analysis; 2) innovative machine learning methods to detect novel combinations of factors associated with heterogeneous response to health- related social needs and health-related social needs interventions while avoiding spurious findings; and 3) thoughtful qualitative investigation. Such an analysis has never before been possible, because the needed data elements have not been united.  This proposal seeks to answer whether improvements in specific health-related social needs are associated with improvements in specific clinical outcomes, in what circumstances, and which approaches to addressing health-related social needs, if any, best improve outcomes. We will leverage what we believe to be the nation’s largest dataset of patient-reported health-related social needs, clinical outcomes, and community- and clinic-level data. We will examine whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. Further, we will evaluate whether clinic-based interventions seem to improve these outcomes, and if there are important variations in these interventions that are associated with different response to the intervention. The proposed work will yield important, previously unavailable evidence on how to refine and improve health-related social need interventions. Specifically, it will help us understand better how better to care for a population at high risk for T2DM complications. Overall, this project will substantially advance NIDDK’s mission to improve health equity for vulnerable individuals with T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, affect over 6 million people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with poor clinical. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of how best to address health-related social needs in the context of diabetes management by testing longitudinal relationships between health-related social needs and diabetes outcomes, evaluating on-going health-related social needs interventions, and learning best practices for future interventions to adopt.

"Predicting the developmental trajectories of cognitive and motor dimensions from preterm neonatal vocalizations Summary One in every 10 babies is born prematurely in the US, and this contributes to high rates of long-term negative health consequences. An even higher rate of preterm births is expected in the near future due to maternal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. While premature birth does not necessarily result in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, it is associated with elevated rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1-9, intellectual disability10, 11, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)2, 12, learning disabilities13, cerebral palsy13, and delays in cognitive, social, and motor development2, 4, 8, 10, 14-16. The developmental risks and uncertainty associated with premature birth may overwhelm caregivers with confusion, stress, and anxiety about the future. Moreover, the heterogeneity of cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories among preterm infants confounds the accurate, early detection of developmental issues and the early implementation of therapeutic interventions17-21. As some forms of early intervention improve the prognoses of infants with (or at high risk of) developmental neuropsychiatric disorders22-28, an objective, quantitative method of predicting (or improving the prediction of) the developmental trajectories of preterm infants is urgently needed. A number of research groups have attempted to use computational models to differentiate the cries of preterm and term infants29-32. However, computational models that can predict the heterogeneous cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories among preterm infants do not exist. Moreover, the neural basis of how preterm birth alters the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories is poorly understood. Based on our preliminary data, which showed that the volume of the amygdala is selectively impacted by a gene variant that is linked to social deficits in mice, we hypothesize that preterm birth also alters the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories from the neonatal to early adult periods via variable alterations of brain structures relevant to cognitive, social, and motor capacities. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our expertise in computational feature selection, using variables of neonatal vocalization and volumes of various mouse brain regions that best account for variances in cognitive, social, and motor capacities. A positive outcome will provide much-needed predictive models to further explore the mechanistic bases of cognitive, social, and motor development in mouse models. This should enable investigators to further evaluate the mechanistic, structural bases for heterogeneous cognitive, social, and motor trajectories in preclinical models of environmental and genetic risk factors. Project Narrative Not all babies exposed to prenatal trauma exhibit delays in cognitive, social, and motor development, but there are no reliable means to predict their heterogeneous developmental trajectories. We put forth a proposal to test the hypothesis that preterm birth impacts the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories from the neonatal period to the early adult period via altered distinct brain structures. A positive outcome will provide a much-needed tool that will allow researchers to explore the mechanisms of heterogeneous developmental delay and test the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in a preterm birth mouse model.",Predicting the developmental trajectories of cognitive and motor dimensions from preterm neonatal vocalizations,10315460,R21HD105287,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' vocalization ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' coisogenic ', ' brain volume ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Cognitive ', ' 16p11.2 ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' high risk ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' neonatal period ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' feature extraction ', ' feature selection ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infection ', ' COVID-19 infection ', ' COVID19 infection ', ' SARS-CoV2 infection ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infection ', ' infected with COVID-19 ', ' infected with COVID19 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV2 ', ' infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R21,2021,240336

"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10226273,R01MH123612,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' body position ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Reciprocal Social Interaction ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' neural correlate ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' collaborative approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' social defeat ', ' social structure ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,416250
"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,10217967,K23MH122669,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Disclosure ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' gaze ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' digital ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Affective ', ' web interface ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195696
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Anthropology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hostility ', ' Inflammation ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Philosophy ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Reporter ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' tribal community ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' eligible participant ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' healthy aging ', ' screening ', ' public health intervention ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' recruit ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213
"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders.

"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Status ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' biracial ', ' bi-racial ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' informatics tool ', ' social factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nonverbal Communication ', ' non-verbal communication ', ' paralinguistic behavior ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Validation ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' Genetic study ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Grain ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Politics ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Semantics ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Misinformation ', ' Comprehension ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' uptake ', ' cancer prevention ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Categories ', ' risk perception ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' human papillomavirus associated malignancy ', ' human papillomavirus-associated cancer ', ' human papillomavirus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' high risk ', ' information processing ', ' information model ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' social media ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Twitter ', ' side effect ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' vaccine acceptance ', ' accept vaccination ', ' accept vaccine ', ' vaccination acceptability ', ' vaccination acceptance ', ' vaccination confidence ', ' vaccination uptake ', ' vaccination willingness ', ' vaccine acceptability ', ' vaccine confidence ', ' vaccine uptake ', ' vaccine willingness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255

This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3.

"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions.

"NYU-Moi Data Science for Social Determinants Training Program Project Summary The overarching goal of the Data Science for Social Determinants (DSSD) at New York University, Moi University and Brown University is to develop future leaders in data science who are equipped to develop and analyze data to better leverage deep and rich survey as well as internet and other digitized data sources that can help us capture information on the social determinants of health. DSSD's design will rapidly expand the local base of expertise via curriculum development, resulting in 2 PhD (4-year training) and 6 total postdoctoral (2-year) and faculty trainees (12-14 month) will train at NYU, while 8 Masters and 2 PhD trainees will commence or complete training (2-year and 4-year training, respectively) through newly developed data science tracks at Moi University. Connecting with local data science industries and organizations (IBM, Deep Learning Indaba, DataKind, AI.Kenya and Aga Khan University Nairobi and Karachi) will bring in and create intellectual meeting spaces for a wide pool and variety of talented trainees from both data science and health backgrounds, to propel and sustainably advance data science capacity in Kenyan institutions as well as the DSI-consortium. Narrative The overarching goal of the Data Science for Social Determinants (DSSD) pre- and post-doctoral training program is to develop future leaders in data science who are equipped to develop and analyze data to better leverage deep and rich survey as well as internet and other digitized data sources that can help us capture information on the social determinants of health. Such data can provide unique illumination into factors on where we live, work, and play which can be used to better understand and address health disparities across noncommunicable disease, infectious disease and injuries in the Kenyan context. However, the data are often unstructured and can have complex relationships with health outcomes, making the use of modern data science approaches critical. DSSD leverages strong investment across biomedical, public health, data science and artificial intelligence investment at both partners (NYU School of Medicine is 11th in the nation for NIH funding, NYU is home of the AI-now institute and Moi University has a strong NIH funding record) as well as a broader network of academic, industrial and non-governmental organizations (IBM, Deep Learning Indaba, DataKind, AI.Kenya and Aga Khan University Nairobi and Karachi), opening a wide pool of potential, strong trainees from both data science and health backgrounds. To develop capacity, priority will be given to Moi affiliates, Kenyan citizens and then others from anywhere in Africa while also prioritizing diversity. A complementary team of 23 mentors at NYU and Moi committed to training and career development will offer resources across social determinants, biomedical sciences, statistics, epidemiology, data management, analytics and ethics. First, the program will provide long-term development of a cohort of PhD, postdoctoral and Faculty fellow trainees who will benefit from interdisciplinary training that carefully layers a core set of competencies in data science across data management and wrangling, prediction and analytics and data communication and ethics, with didactic and experiential training in social determinants as well as best practices in responsible conduct of research, reproducibility and community-engaged, ethical data science at NYU. Second, the program will leverage international standard biostatistics and informatics faculty and programming at Moi with trainees equipped in advanced data science coursework at NYU, to expand the base of local expertise and capacity in data science by developing MSc and PhD data science tracks at the Institute for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics programs at Moi University within 5 years. Finally, continuing education opportunities and networking will occur through workshops bringing together experts in health and data science in Kenya and surrounding areas. Programs will be evaluated annually by our Internal Advisory Board and Training Advisory Committee. As social determinants can be cross-cutting rather than disease-specific, classroom and research opportunities across social determinants and their applicability to wide range of health application domains will be available at both project sites and curricula will be relevant to research and training efforts across the entire DSI-Africa consortium.",NYU-Moi Data Science for Social Determinants Training Program,10320171,U2RTW012121,"['Data Sources ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Kenya ', ' New York ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' meetings ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' social health determinants ', ' curriculum development ', ' Data Science ', ' deep learning ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' ']",FIC,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,U2R,2021,349655
"Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors,10269964,R00MH117264,"['Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Animal Housing ', ' Hunger ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preoptic Areas ', ' preoptic region ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' generalized anxiety ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,244320
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions.

"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,10167665,R01DA046619,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Central Nervous System Depressants ', ' CNS Depressants ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Actiq ', ' Duragesic ', ' Fentanest ', ' Fentyl ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity -

"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' European Union ', ' European Community ', ' Family ', ' Genetic Identity ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Imagination ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Newspapers ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Protection ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Film ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Privacy ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Legal ', ' Radio ', ' ACT2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' Act-2 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' MIP1B ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' community setting ', ' minimal risk ', ' legal implication ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' genetic information ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Genetic study ', ' social media ', ' data access ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' Infrastructure ', ' blockchain ', ' block chain ', ' data privacy ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733
"Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX) PROJECT ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS), a trisomy of chromosome 21 and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, was once a condition in which children would rarely see adulthood. In 1950, the estimated mean life expectancy for a person with DS was 26 years and median age at death was 4 years. With improvements in recognition and treatment of co-occurring conditions of DS, such as congenital heart defects, the estimated median life expectancy in 2010 was 53 years (median age at death was 58). There is now a large and diverse population with DS across all ages who are in dire need of solutions and treatments for medical issues that were inconceivable 60 years ago. Two conditions of high interest that often presage other morbidity, greatly harm quality of life, and lead to premature mortality are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and dementia. OSA is an episodic sleep-state collapse of the upper airway which results in reduction or lack of ventilation during sleep and is prevalent in more than half of people with DS. The triplication of chromosome 21 in DS is associated with an overproduction of the amyloid precursor protein and is pivotal to the accelerated development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Even when not the proximal cause of death, in post-mortem autopsy nearly all older adults with DS have beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that signify Alzheimer's disease. More needs to be known about causes, course, and the impact of social determinants on these conditions and resulting premature mortality, especially as clinical DS samples are often under powered and often lack participants of color. To meet the directives of the National Institutes of Health's Investigation of Co-occurring conditions across the lifespan in Down syndrome project and the National Institute on Aging's priorities we propose to create Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS-TO-THE-MAX). DS-TO-THE-MAX will identify a retrospective longitudinal cohort of >100,000 adults with DS and >4,000,000 adults without DS from 10 years of Medicaid Analytic eXtract data plus additional Medicare data for dual enrollees. Our innovation lies in a DS sample orders of magnitude larger than past work, a social determinants of health framework, and novel machine learning and quantitative bias analysis methods. We will complete two aims: 1) Assess epidemiology and social determinants of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality 2) Use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality. The results of this project will strengthen the epidemiologic and public health basis for DS research and population level intervention. In building the DS-TO THE MAX cohort and assessing risk, resilience, social determinants we will have a vital big data set to complement clinical research and work toward the population with DS living long, healthy, and self-determined lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE While lifespan has greatly expanded for people with Down syndrome (DS) in the last seventy years, the population still experiences burdensome morbidities and premature mortality. This project contributes to public health knowledge by developing the Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract Project (DS-TO-THE-MAX), a 10-year retrospective cohort of >100,000 adults with and >4,000,000 adults without DS enrolled in Medicaid, a US public health insurance program for low income and / or disabled people. With these data, we will describe epidemiology, identify risks and social determinants, and use machine learning to identify factors that may predict occurrence or resilience of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality in a diverse sample orders of magnitude larger than previous DS studies.",Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX),10274393,R01AG073179,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosome 21 ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Down Syndrome ', "" Down's Syndrome "", ' Downs Syndrome ', ' Langdon Down syndrome ', ' Mongolism ', ' Trisomy 21 ', ' chromosome 21 trisomy syndrome ', ' congenital acromicria syndrome ', ' morbus Down ', ' pseudohypertrophic progressive muscular dystrophy ', ' trisomy 21 syndrome ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Models ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -
