"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,10140308,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER,10222593,R00CA218667,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Eosin ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Community Practice ', ' Seminal ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' cloud based ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811
"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics.

"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating

"Immunoengineering Next-Generation Cancer Therapies with Focused Ultrasound Project Abstract Metastatic breast cancer (BrCa) is the 2nd most prevalent cause of cancer mortality in women in the United States, with a 5-year overall survival of only 22%. Though cancer immunotherapies are capable of generating durable responses across a variety of cancer types, immunologic rejection of BrCa is rare and spontaneous regression unusual. Thus, there exists a strong precedent for allied combinatorial therapy paradigms that potentiate immunotherapy (ITx) by boosting tumor immunogenicity and/or curbing immunosuppressive mechanisms. In this proposal, we will systematically assess the capacity of focused ultrasound (FUS) - a technique for non-invasive, non-ionizing acoustic energy deposition into tumors – to potentiate adaptive immunity against BrCa metastases and synergize with selected immunotherapies. UVA is a world leader in FUS ITx research, with two “first-in-human” clinical trials underway to evaluate combinations of FUS with PD1 blockade in solid tumors (including metastatic BrCa) and a third trial pending approval to evaluate FUS and gemcitabine for immune-mediated control of BrCa tumors. These trials are accompanied by a companion imaging trial designed to evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration in patients’ tumor deposits via PET/CT, an approach that will also be integrated into our pre-clinical studies. To this end, this proposal leverages these clinical trials as well as a robust pre-clinical program to fortify a highly translational research pipeline rooted in the domains of immunology, molecular imaging, liquid biopsy and radiogenomics. With this toolkit, we intend to design and implement FUS+ITx combinations that offer the potential for quantum improvements in metastatic BrCa therapy. This is achieved in three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand on intriguing early clinical and pre-clinical findings to identify FUS regimens that, when combined with myeloid-targeted therapies, augment the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy against primary and disseminated BrCa tumors (e.g. brain metastases). In Specific Aim 2, we will engineer FUS-based theranostic technologies for liquid biopsy in BrCa in order to (i) discover novel biomarkers of response to FUS and ITx (ii) enable liquid biopsy in settings with low basal levels of circulating tumor biomarkers. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will construct machine learning frameworks that integrate radiological data with genomic data from liquid biopsy specimens (e.g. radiogenomics) to advance BrCa precision care with FUS and ITx. The highly innovate aims of this proposal lend to a systematic approach for advancing the role of FUS in CAR T cell therapy, cancer biomarker discovery and personalized ITx, thereby promising to improve the lives of metastatic breast cancer patients. Project Narrative For the significant fraction of metastatic breast cancer patients that are yet unable to realize the unparalleled benefits of cancer immunotherapy, focused ultrasound (FUS) is poised to play a transformative role - owing to its diverse capacity for destroying solid tumor tissue, enhancing drug delivery and promoting anti-tumor immune response. The goal of this proposal is to design and deploy rational combinations of FUS and immunotherapy in primary and disseminated breast cancers (with special emphasis on CAR T cell therapy), as well as to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring and individualizing these combinations through the use of innovative approaches in molecular imaging, liquid biopsy and radiogenomics. The highly translational structure of this proposal offers the potential for quantum improvements in metastatic breast cancer prognosis and therapy and meanwhile ushers FUS into the burgeoning era of

"Radiomic and genomic predictors of breast cancer risk ABSTRACT Over 40,000 U.S. women will die of breast cancer each year. Screening mammography saves lives but also results in potential harms. Personalized screening regimens tailored to a woman's individual risk can both improve early detection of lethal cancers through more intensive regimens for high-risk women, and reduce over-screening and over-treatment of low-risk women. However, the current clinical breast cancer risk prediction models are insufficiently accurate for discriminating high-risk and low-risk women. New radiomic deep learning algorithms, which automatically mine troves of breast tissue features from a woman's screening mammogram to predict her future cancer risk, have enormous potential to transform breast cancer screening, but have not been independently validated. New polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast cancer also show promise for improving risk prediction, although still costly to implement on a population scale. We propose to examine whether adding radiomic and genomic risk scores can significantly improve current clinical risk prediction models in a large, diverse population-based cohort of 178K women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente's Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) who were screened with 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM). We also propose to extend the best performing radiomic deep learning algorithms to diverse screening mammography systems utilized in two large health care settings in California and New York, including a cohort of 50K women screened with 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). The specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the performance of radiomic deep learning breast cancer risk prediction models, estimate their associations with 5-year and 10-year breast cancer risk, and determine the extent to which the associations are independent of known clinical risk factors; (2) Determine whether radiomic and genomic risk scores independently predict breast cancer risk, and explore potential differences by race/ethnicity and other clinical risk factors; and (3) Transfer the best radiomic deep learning algorithm(s) from 2D FFDM to 3D tomosynthesis. The proposed research will fill essential knowledge gaps needed to realize the potential of radiomics and genomics by validating new radiomic algorithms, quantifying the improvements in model performance above traditional risk factor models and new polygenic risk scores, exploring differences by race/ethnicity, and extending the best radiomic tools to diverse mammography systems utilized in two large multi-ethnic health care settings. 1 NARRATIVE Screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality, but can also result in over-diagnosis and over- treatment. Improved breast cancer risk prediction models can enable personalized screening tailored to each woman's risk, and thereby maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of screening. Our study will examine whether breast tissue features automatically extracted from mammograms (radiomics) and polygenic risk scores can significantly improve upon current clinical breast cancer risk prediction models among ethnically diverse women undergoing screening mammography in two large community health settings. 1",Radiomic and genomic predictors of breast cancer risk,10317507,R01CA264987,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Mining ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Health system ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' personalized screening ', ' precision screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' radiomics ', ' genomic predictors ', ' tomosynthesis ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' risk prediction model ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,712593
"Evolutionary dynamics and microenvironmental determinants of metastatic breast cancer Abstract/Project Summary Metastatic breast cancer and relapse following therapy are dependent on (1) development of intrinsic resistance to targeted and endocrine therapies, and (2) resistance to recognition and destruction of cancer cells by the immune system. The Stanford Breast Metastasis Center (SBMC) is focused on (1) quantifying the timing of metastatic dissemination in breast cancer (2) functionally delineating the contribution of cellular and microenvironmental crosstalk on metastatic proclivity, and (3) characterizing the mechanisms of responses by metastatic cells to therapies.  In order to achieve these goals, mechanistic computational models that capture dynamic and emergent tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic properties are needed as are clinically annotated longitudinal tissue cohorts and experimental models that capture disease heterogeneity. The SBMC addresses each of these outstanding challenges. First, we have established an unparalleled collection of clinically annotated breast cancer cohorts sampled through treatment and metastasis, including both prospective and retrospective longitudinal cohorts, with multiple metastatic sites. We leverage a living biobank of breast cancer patient- derived organoids (PDOs) from primary tumors and metastases that recapitulate the heterogeneity of disease, high-risk of relapse subgroups and tumor-immune interactions and greatly facilitating the proposed functional studies. We characterize these vast tissue resources and model systems using state-of-the-art molecular profiling technologies to probe tumor tissue in situ at single cell and subcellular resolution. Specifically, with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging (MALDI) we simultaneously visualize the composition, lineage, function and spatial distribution of tumor and stromal cell populations and perform co-registered analysis of the glycome. We integrate these data within the genomic landscape of metastatic disease and analyze these data within robust machine learning and computational frameworks to uncover disease dynamics and features associated with clinical outcomes. Lastly, we conduct genome-scale CRISPR screens in 3D breast cancer models to systematically define oncogenic dependencies, therapeutic vulnerabilities and macrophage-tumor cell interactions.  This integrated systems biology and functional genomics approach will contribute to a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of metastatic breast cancer and the dynamic relationship between tumor cells and the host, with implications for therapeutic targeting.

"Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries One of the biggest cancer challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the lack of access to accurate and affordable cellular and molecular diagnostics, which are essential for making informed therapeutic decisions, in particular for breast cancer. With the increased use of low cost ultrasound, it has become possible to readily sample suspicious breast lesions with ﬁne needles (ﬁne needle aspirates, FNA). However, the workup of such specimens is often impossible in many LMIC settings. To address these barriers to diagnosis, Aikili—derived from A.I. and Akili (intelligence in Kiswahili)—seeks to enable the same-day diagnosis of breast cancer at the point-of-care using a low-cost, automated system. The Aikili system is a highly advanced stand-alone diagnostic platform capable of automated cancer diagnosis and receptor sub- typing in near real-time (< 1 hour), at a low cost (<$800 for integrated hardware and $5-10 per test). Building upon our initial development and successful clinical validation of human samples, the goal of this Phase I application is to advance the Aikili technology to signiﬁcantly improve its usability in resource-limited settings. Speciﬁcally, we propose to i) upgrade Aikili technology by incorporating a custom-designed disposable cartridge for onsite sample processing and deep learning algorithms for automatic analysis (Aim 1), and ii) evaluate the performance of the upgraded system in LMIC workﬂows through a validation study in Kenya (n = 30) (Aim 2). We will consider the Phase I project successful when we can show that the ﬁeld-optimized Aikili system accurately and reliably detects breast cancer and receptor status in human FNAs compared to accepted gold standards. Successful completion of Phase I would lead to a Phase II application for scale-up of manufacturing and a larger, multi-site clinical validation study. This platform may alter therapeutic paradigms for breast cancer patients in globally and enable appropriate use of chemotherapies and anti-estrogens in limited supply. We will develop a standalone, AI-powered diagnostic system to enable early cancer detection in low resource settings. Our system has the potential to transform cancer diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries where cytopathology is a major bottleneck; it will augment workflows by enabling non-expert healthcare workers to rapidly establish cancer diagnoses and identify molecular subtypes within 1 hour. This will inform the most appropriate therapeutic choices in collaboration with specialist physicians, as well as reduce patient loss to follow-up (LTF) by providing diagnosis in near real-time.",Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries,10154237,R43CA257694,"['Affect ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Decentralization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Estrogen Antagonists ', ' Anti-Estrogens ', ' antiestrogen ', ' antiestrogenic ', ' estrogen inhibitor ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Needles ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Lesion ', ' Logistics ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' ERBB2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER2 ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2/neu ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' NEU protein ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' neu Genes ', ' Cytopathology ', ' Cytology and Pathology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' breast lesion ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' validation studies ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' FNA ', ' Fine Needle Aspirate ', ' Fine-Needle Aspiration ', ' Fine needle aspiration biopsy ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' chemotherapy ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NCI,AIKILI BIOSYSTEMS INC.,R43,2021,400000
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,10163142,R44CA240022,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illinois ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Reader ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Callback ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' ']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,867119
"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,10109103,R21CA245597,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Biochemical ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' brain micrometastasis ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' brain cell ', ' cancer complication ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' migration ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' translational approach ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' operation ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' Breast cancer metastasis ', ' Breast Metastasis ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' histological slides ', ' histologic slides ', ' Clinical stratification ', ' pathology imaging ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' in-vitro diagnostics ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,182325
"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,10104459,R21CA234752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Decision Making ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Methods ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Radiation Scattering ', ' Woman ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' proton therapy ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' environmental radiation ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' dosimetry ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Radiation-Induced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Radiation-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' radiation related cancer ', ' radiation related neoplasm/cancer ', ' Radiation-Induced Cancer ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Validation ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biological systems ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Contralateral Breast ', ' Contra-lateral Breast ', ' radiation risk ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' clinical decision support ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' random forest ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2021,167926
"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,10206069,K08CA241365,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Slide ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' skills ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' cost ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical implementation ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' random forest ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' complex data ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' clinical center ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2021,260112
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,10206058,R37CA232209,"['Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Fibronectins ', ' Cold-Insoluble Globulins ', ' FN1 ', ' Fibronectin 1 ', ' LETS Proteins ', ' Large External Transformation-Sensitive Protein ', ' Opsonic Glycoprotein ', ' Opsonic alpha(2)SB Glycoprotein ', ' alpha 2-Surface Binding Glycoprotein ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Organoids ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pleural effusion disorder ', ' Pleural Effusion ', ' pleural cavity effusion ', ' Proteins ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' EGFR ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' HER1 ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbBl ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' E-Cadherin ', ' Cadherin-1 ', ' Epithelial Calcium-Dependent Adhesion Protein ', ' Epithelial-Cadherin ', ' Uvomorulin ', ' Vimentin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Experimental Models ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Lesion Composition and Quantitative Imaging Analysis on Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract. Women with dense breast have not been shown to benefit by increased cancer detection of volumetric digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) but may benefit by lower recall rates. DBT screening biopsy rates are similar to 2D digital mammography; higher for first screening exams, lower thereafter with adjustment for age and breast density. In the U.S., 71% of biopsies do not result in a breast cancer diagnosis among women ages 40-79 who undergo breast cancer screening. To address the high rate of unnecessary biopsies, an innovative way to use FDA-approved breast imaging protocols has been developed to acquire multispectral images to measure the lipid/water/protein (L/W/P) composition of suspicious breast lesions. Malignant breast tissue has unique L/W/P composition fractions when compared to normal or benign breast tissue. This proposal aims to increase biopsy yield (BI-RADS-PPV3) through combining L/W/P biological biomarkers with quantitative morphological and textural image analysis. This combination of composition and physical descriptions of suspicious breast lesions is called q3CB. The benefits of adding q3CB to the current DBT screening/diagnostic imaging paradigm, that may already include computer aided detection, is not known. This study is designed to compare the expected biopsy yield with and without q3CB in a clinical reader study and explore how q3CB may be combine with existing technologies. The central hypothesis is that biological L/W/P fractions in breast tissue in combination with analysis of morphological and textural tissue characteristics will yield significantly higher breast cancer specificity than conventional interpretation of DBT alone. The objective is to better identify suspicious breast lesions that need to be biopsied for malignancy in women currently recommended for biopsy. The long-term goal is to reduce unnecessary biopsies and increase biopsy yield. Our rationale for the proposed research is that biological L/W/P descriptions of breast lesions will lead to more specific biopsy decisions and a better understanding of cancer types. Specifically, the project aims are 1) develop q3CB lesion signatures for distinguishing breast cancer lesions from benign lesions, using 600 prospectively-acquired DBT exams of women recommended to undergo biopsy; 2) conduct a clinical reader study to compare radiologists' performance on standard-of-care FFDM or DBT without and with the inclusion of q3CB signatures; 3) Investigate the utility of q3CB lesion signatures in a screening paradigm to improve sensitivity and specificity on CADe-identified suspicious lesions in the tasks of assessing malignancy as well as in associating with their association with cancer subtypes; Exploratory) explore the added sensitivity and specificity of dual-energy DBT in phantom studies that explore lesion size, composition, and breast density. The innovation of this study is the full characterization of lipid/water/protein lesion composition with DBT and how it complements existing computer aided diagnostic programs paired with clinical radiologists providing evidence ready for clinical translation of this unique and emerging technology. Project Narrative. The proposed studies are relevant to public health because they have the potential to increase the effectiveness of diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. Thus, this advance is expected to have a high impact to the health and well being of women because mammography and tomosynthesis are currently the primary diagnostic tools for early breast cancer detection, and over two-thirds of women diagnosed through these imaging modes do not have cancer, resulting in many unnecessary painful invasive procedures.

"Identifying responders to chemotherapy in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: development of a multivariable clinical prediction tool Project Summary/Abstract  Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent breast cancer, which is the most common malignancy affecting women in the United States. Although ILC has unique molecular and clinical features, it is not well-studied, and no specific therapeutic strategies exist for it. One of the major challenges in the treatment of women with ILC is determining whether cytotoxic chemotherapy should be utilized or not. Currently available gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype and Mammaprint tests) classify the majority of ILC tumors as molecularly “low risk,” which suggests that cytotoxic chemotherapy will be ineffective. However, ILC is more likely than other types of breast cancer to present at advanced stages with lymph node involvement, making these patients clinically “high risk.” This “clinical high risk” status drives chemotherapy use in patients with ILC, despite discordant results from molecular assays. Indeed, the majority of node-positive ILC patients receive chemotherapy, despite the absence of data suggesting benefit for any individual patient. There is a huge need to improve patient selection, so that chemotherapy can be utilized only in patients who will benefit from it, while others can be spared its toxic side effects. In parallel, for patients with predicted poor response to standard chemotherapy, we need personalized approaches that target the unique molecular pathways involved in ILC. There have been recent advances in our understanding of ILC, and several groups have now identified ILC specific gene signatures that show significant heterogeneity within this group of tumors. Given this newly available data, we can now start incorporating ILC specific tools into clinical practice and develop tailored treatment strategies for women with ILC. In this proposal, I will address this via the following three approaches. First, I will evaluate a novel early indicator of chemotherapy responsiveness in ILC, improving our ability to determine whether a tumor has responded or not. Given the relatively small numbers of ILC patients in clinical trials, I will conduct a pooled analysis using 12 combined datasets from breast cancer patients treated with pre-operative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Second, I will leverage the recent discovery of ILC- specific gene expression signatures and the data available in the I-SPY2 Trial to develop a predictive tool to identify chemotherapy responders (Chemotherapy in Lobular breast cancer Effectiveness and Response [CLEAR] score). Finally, I will conduct a pilot study testing a novel, targeted agent in combination with endocrine therapy in the I-SPY2 Trial, through a new arm termed the Endocrine Optimization Pathway. This project addresses an important, relevant clinical issue, utilizes new datasets and molecular signatures not previously available, and importantly, will allow me to develop skills and knowledge in a mentored setting that will facilitate my ability to design and conduct prospective clinical trials for women with ILC. Project Narrative By conventional measures, women with estrogen receptor positive invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) have poor responses to standard treatment approaches. Given the poor outcomes seen in patients with ILC, there is a great need to improve patient selection for standard chemotherapy and identify novel treatment strategies. In this project, I will develop a new clinical prediction tool to identify chemotherapy responders, and conduct a pilot trial testing a novel agent for estrogen receptor positive tumors.",Identifying

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls.

"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment.

"SCH: Leverage clinical knowledge to augment deep learning analysis of breast images Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have achieved remarkable success in medical image-based applications. Today, there are unprecedented needs in developing novel strategies and methodologies to enable robust, trustworthy, and accessible AI for various applications. Classic deep learning training is driven purely by data. In the medical domain, clinical knowledge is often available and useful, but is mostly ignored in the current practice of AI research. Incorporating clinical knowledge into deep learning modeling requires an in-depth understanding of medical context/workflow. This calls for multi-disciplinary collaborative research using computational techniques and clinical sciences to advance the biomedical data/AI research. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new paradigm of deep learning that combines imaging data and clinical knowledge to augment breast cancer diagnosis, risk assessment, and lesion detection. We will develop technical innovations on breast imaging to address deep learning modeling on small datasets, longitudinal examinations, and content-efficient images, through three specific aims: Aim 1: Formulate auxiliary tasks/assessment into model training of CNNs for breast cancer diagnosis on small datasets; Aim 2: Employ biological relationships of images to guide deep learning structure design for breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal data; Aim 3: Develop a knowledge-guided unsupervised pipeline for identification of a suspicion map to support deep learning analysis on content-efficient images. These aims represent novel applied methodological development to build roust deep learning models for important clinical imaging applications. We have strong preliminary results for each aim and an experienced research team covering computational, biomedical, engineering, and clinical sciences. Our proposed study has a broader impact on developing robust and innovative AI strategies/methods to enable clinical imaging AI applications. Going beyond breast imaging, our proposed concepts, paradigms, and methods can also be adapted/applicable to other diseases and imaging modalities, leading to benefits for a wide range of biomedical imaging analyses. Any algorithms, knowledge, insights, and experience gained from this study will have a direct and substantial impact on the rapid evolvement and applications of medical imaging AI devices, ultimately benefiting the researchers, clinicians, and patients. The goal of this study is to develop a new paradigm of deep learning that combines medical imaging data and clinical knowledge to augment breast cancer diagnosis, risk assessment, and lesion detection.

"Comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment to predict patient response to immunotherapy Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and there are few available treatment options for patients with this disease. Recently, immunotherapy has shown promise in a subset of TNBC patients. However, identifying which patients will benefit from immunotherapy is currently extremely challenging. In order to understand why certain patients respond to immunotherapy and others do not, we need to develop a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is made up of cancer cells, as well as the immune and stromal cells which surround them. Previous work has demonstrated that changes in the relative abundance of certain cell types in the TME can predict whether patients will respond to treatment. However, we have lacked the tools to develop a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of interaction between the different cells in the TME. For the F99 phase of this proposal, I will combine multiplexed imaging with exome sequencing to comprehensively profile the TME in TNBC patients. I will analyze 100 TNBC patient samples from a clinical trial testing the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. I will first link genetic alterations to changes in the localization of cells in the TME, to increase our understanding of the relationship between cancer genetics and host cell infiltration. I will then use these relationships to generate biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. For the K00 phase of this proposal, I will develop an organoid model of the TNBC TME. Using this organoid model, I will determine how the absence of myeloid cells alters the phenotype of the organoid. I will then use single-cell sequencing to identify the transcriptional changes that myeloid cells undergo following treatment with anti-PD-1. This fellowship will provide me with the necessary training in both computational analysis and experimental methods to lead my own group studying the interaction between the immune system and cancer. This project will provide significant insight into the mechanisms of response and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. By developing better biomarkers of response, this work will help to inform clinical care and may guide clinical trial design testing our findings. Identifying the transcriptional changes following anti-PD-1 treatment will generate novel hypotheses for the creation of new combination treatments, influencing subsequent therapeutic development.",Comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment to predict patient response to immunotherapy,10304556,F99CA264307,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering /

"Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis Abstract: In early breast carcinogenesis, neoplastic cells grow in multiple layers towards the lumens of ducts, which subjects the periluminal cells to harsh conditions of low oxygen, low pH, and nutrient deprivation. Adaptation to these harsh conditions is a pre-requisite for survival of incipient tumor cells. Adaptations are initially acute and reversible, but eventually Darwinian selection results in cells with hardwired phenotypes. A prominent example of this is aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg Effect (WE), wherein cells are hard-wired to ferment glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. Notably, a WE is highly correlated with a cancer’s metastatic potential and poor outcome. Hence, a major question in carcinogenesis is: “What are the mechanisms by which a harsh microenvironment eventually selects for hard-wired (heritable) phenotypes, such as a WE?”. Rather than simply selection of pre-existing phenotypes, we contend that the microenvironment actively induces phenotypic diversity through a systematic set of epigenetic and genetic alterations.  To address this question, we combine preliminary data from three different approaches that are all focused on the eco-evolutionary dynamics occurring during carcinogenesis: In the first, we have subjected benign breast cancer and epithelial cells to harsh conditions encountered in DCIS and have observed that the cells that survive these selections exhibit a WE. We selected three clones and applied single cell RNA sequencing and single cell ATAQ sequencing as well as whole exome sequencing to map the transcriptome, epigenome, and mutation patterns of the selected clones compared to their parental normal cells. This will form the model system to be analyzed throughout the current proposal. In the second line of investigation, we have documented the profound epigenetic changes that occur during progression of multiple myeloma (MM) from pre-malignant to metabolically active disease. We hypothesize that these observations in MM can provide a framework to predict and interpret the changes that breast cancer cells undergo as they transition from a benign non-glycolytic to an aggressive glycolytic state. In the third line of investigation, we have outlined a continuum starting with epigenetic changes and show how these result in permanent mutational or chromosomal changes. This latter work provides a framework with which to predict and interpret how microenvironment-induced epigenetic changes can eventually lead to hardwired genetic changes that are observed in aggressive glycolytic breast cancer. By combining these approaches, we propose to decipher the mechanisms whereby microenvironmental stress-induced genome evolution results in hard-wired phenotypic adaptations, represented by a WE.  At the end this study, we expect to have a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the environmentally-induced epigenetic and genetic changes that occur during carcinogenesis, and how these relate to hard-wired phenotypic profiles, as exemplified by the Warburg Effect. Narrative This proposal tries to answer a major question in carcinogenesis: “How do harsh microenvironments select for hardwired metabolic phenotypes, such as Warburg Effect, leading to carcinogenesis”? Combining three high technology approaches of cancer evolutionary biology, mathematical modeling, and system biology, we propose to decipher the relationship between microenvironmental stress-induced genome evolution that results in hardwired phenotypic adaptation represented by a WE as an initiator of cancer. Solving this problem will have significance as it is a long-standing problem in cancer biology.",Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis,10273324,U01CA261841,"['O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Proteins ', ' Starvation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Benign ', ' Comedo ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' stressor ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' transcriptional silencing ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' aerobic glycolysis ', ' novel ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Normal Cell ', ' HK2 ', ' HKII ', ' HXK2 ', ' HK2 gene ', ' In Situ Lesion ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Warburg Effect ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' tumorigenic ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' MCF10A cells ', ' MCF-10A ', ' MCF10A ', ' stem ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' epigenome ', ' Breast Epithelial Cells ', ' mammary epithelial cells ', ' Breast Carcinogenesis ', ' nutrient deprivation ', ' nutritional deprivation ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Acidosis ', ' Affect ', ' Aneuploidy ', ' Aneuploid ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Multiple Myeloma ', ' Plasma-Cell Myeloma ', ' myeloma ', ' myelomatosis ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxygen ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Developing Digital Pathology Biomarkers for Response to Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Project Summary  Although tremendous strides have been made in uncovering the biology of breast cancer, selection of chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer is based predominantly on receptor status and stage. However, numerous other factors are associated with response, including gene expression patterns and tumor genetics, but these are not uniformly available for patients. Hematoxylin and eosin stained pathology is routinely obtained for all patients with breast cancer, and contains a wealth of information beyond grade. For example, the pattern and amount of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes has long been recognized as a predictor of response to chemotherapy, but quantification is challenging.  Deep learning is an emerging discipline with particular promise in the domain of image recognition, wherein models can learn from repeated exposure to sample images to recognize any candidate features of interest. Using deep learning, our group and others have successfully used histology to predict a variety of tumor specific factors linked with response to treatment, including receptor status, gene expression patterns, driver mutations, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. These features can be accurately detected at point of care, without the extended turn-around time and expense associated with specialized molecular testing. We hypothesize that deep learning on histology can identify novel morphologic and spatial features of breast cancer tumors that in turn can predict response to chemotherapy in early breast cancer. We will take advantage of a rich institutional cohort of over 600 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and over 2000 patients with long term survival data to curate a well annotated database suited for deep learning on digital histology. Our patient cohort also features diverse demographics with inclusion of minority patients often underrepresented in public datasets, ensuring applicability of our findings to all patients with breast cancer. We will use this dataset to develop a deep learning histologic biomarker of chemotherapy response in early stage breast cancer. This deep learning biomarker will be compared to standard markers of response to determine if deep learning on histology provides independent predictive value, allowing better identification of candidates for intensification or de-intensification of standard anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy. Project Narrative Nearly one in eight women will develop a diagnosis of breast cancer over the course of their lifetime, and nearly one in five with early stage disease will receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment. Deep learning on digital histology has the potential to better predict response to treatment than standard histologic analysis, allowing for more personalized selection of treatment

"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation,10143213,R01CA245699,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibodies ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Aggregation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasm Circulating Cells ', ' circulating neoplastic cell ', ' circulating tumor cell ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' Mediating ', ' Yang ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung ', ' Metastasis to the Lung ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Lung ', ' lung metastasis ', ' metastasize to the lung ', ' pulmonary metastasis ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' CDKN1A gene ', ' CDK-Interacting Protein 1 ', ' CDKN1 ', ' CDKN1A ', ' CIP1 ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A ', ' WAF1 ', ' Wildtype p53-Activated Fragment 1 ', ' p21 gene ', ' p21 protein ', ' Oncologist ', ' Blocking Antibodies ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' CD44 ', ' MDU3 ', ' Pgp1 ', ' CD44 gene ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Extracellular Domain ', ' External Domain ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' tumorigenic ', ' migration ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' stemness ', ' tumor ', ' MDA MB 231 ', ' MDA-231 ', ' MDA-MB231 ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Breast cancer metastasis ', ' Breast Metastasis ', ' 4T1 ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' Mammospheres ', ' Patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer ', ' Breast PDX models ', ' breast cancer PDX ', ' breast cancer patient-derived xenograft ', ' Breast Oncology ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' lung colonization ', ' colonization associated with lung ', ' colonization in the lung ', ' colonization within the lung ', ' patient derived xenograft model ', ' PDX model ', ' Patient derived xenograft ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,478017
"Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening SUMMARY Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date. Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning “from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable in particular to cancers with more limited datasets. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to detect breast cancer as early as possible while limiting the burden of screening in high-risk women. To this end, risk will be estimated from magnetic resonance images of the breast as well as mammograms using deep learning techniques. A retrospective analysis of a very large dataset will determine if some women could have avoided unnecessary scans without missing newly developing cancers.",Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening,10121555,R01CA247910,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Population ', ' Cancerous ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' contrast imaging ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' screening program ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data curation ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' ']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,703284
"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health

"Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer Project Summary/Abstract This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher. The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3; integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K08 Award. Project Narrative Metastatic breast cancer, of which hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common, is estimated to affect approximately 150,000 women in the United States; most of these women will die of breast cancer, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among women. This proposal will examine distinct molecular categories of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer to understand whether different treatments may affect these groups differently. The knowledge gained will lay the groundwork for a personalized approach to therapy for metastatic breast cancer to improve health and lengthen life.",Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic

"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,10159953,K01HL152009,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,10194417,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,637416
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases. The main goal of this work is to build a model that recapitulates tumor-immune interactions in brain-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and use this model to identify novel druggable targets to improve survival outcomes in patients with devastating brain metastases.",Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain

"Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms Project Summary The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and, therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%) never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus, offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential (≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation. We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT), convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups. Project Narrative There is much controversy surrounding breast cancer screening guidelines, resulting in women making individual choices regarding their screening, in consultation with their physician. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to women as to the benefit of screening mammography for them as an individual. Our research goal is to develop a near-term mammography-detectable breast cancer risk marker using a new image transformation, deep learning, and statistical approach for longitudinal data on serial mammograms that will help women choose their own personalized protocol in consultation with their doctor.",Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms,10174885,R37CA248207,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Records ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Radon ', ' Rn element ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Consensus ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' cancer risk ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Advocate ', ' Age-Years ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' breast density ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' personalized screening ', ' precision screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' data curation ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,357994
"Real-Time Freehand Ultrasound Molecular Imaging with Deep Learning Project Summary Earlier detection has reduced breast cancer mortality in recent years; however, current imaging tools have poor positive predictive value and likely contribute to overdiagnosis. Ultrasound molecular imaging (UMI) is a promising tool that can provide noninvasive, non-ionizing, real-time, freehand breast cancer tumor assessment at the point of care. UMI uses targeted ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and has the potential to reduce false positive rates and overdiagnosis. However, poor UMI image quality has led researchers to trade the beneﬁts of real-time and freehand imaging for better image quality, resulting in longer exam times, higher UCA dosage, and potentially missed targets. This project will develop a new real-time freehand UMI approach based on deep learning to achieve excellent detection of breast cancer. A spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) approach is proposed to speciﬁcally detect adherent UCAs, which indicate disease, in real-time while suppressing background noise from tissue and free UCAs. A physics- driven simulator of breast UMI will be constructed and calibrated with phantom and water tank measurements. A database of simulated UMI time series will be assembled and used to train the spatiotemporal CNN to identify adherent UCAs. Finally, the CNN will be deployed on a prototype real-time freehand UMI system, operating in excess of 30 frames per second. This system will be tested in a UMI study of breast cancer detection in a transgenic mouse model. This study will use UCAs targeted to a novel biomarker (B7-H3) that is highly speciﬁc for cancer and is believed to correlate strongly with likelihood of progression to invasive breast cancer. The real-time freehand approach is signiﬁcant because it enables the operator to freely interrogate (and revisit) multiple targets with a single UCA injection, reducing exam times and UCA dosage. The proposed approach is innovative because it uses CNNs to better utilize data that is already acquired during UMI. The proposed system will be able to detect breast cancer with high image quality using real-time freehand UMI of B7-H3, potentially reducing false positives and overdiagnosis and thus unnecessary tests, biopsies, costs, and patient distress. The K99 phase will provide dedicated training and career growth opportunities in molecular imaging, UCA synthe- sis and targeting, animal study design, small animal UMI, clinical UMI, and other dedicated preparation needed to transition to a faculty position and an independent research career studying imaging methods for UMI. These training activities will provide the skills necessary to complete the proposed animal study in the R00 phase. Project Narrative Early breast cancer detection and treatment have helped to reduce mortality in recent years, but current imaging tools produce a large number of false positives and overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary tests, biopsies, and patient distress. This work aims to develop a new real-time ultrasound molecular imaging (UMI) technique to better identify cancerous lesions with fewer false positives and overdiagnoses. The proposed approach will use deep learning to more effectively utilize all of the raw information available during UMI, and will potentially provide more sensitive and speciﬁc breast cancer detection with reduced scan times, contrast agent dosage, and costs.",Real-Time Freehand Ultrasound Molecular Imaging with Deep Learning,10283513,K99EB032230,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Mammary Ultrasonography ', ' Breast Ultrasonography ', ' Ultrasonic Mammography ', ' Ultrasound Mammography ', ' breast ultrasound ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' dosage ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Distress ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' portability ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' technique development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Cancerous ', ' translational study ', ' Network-based ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' targeted agent ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' CD276 gene ', ' B7-H3 ', ' B7H3 ', ' CD276 ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical translation ', ' imaging study ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' Injections ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,91260
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Time-Resolved Wide-Field Molecular Optical Tomography (Parent R01) ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, using the RFA-CA-20-021, Revision Applications for Incorporation of NCI-Supported Technology to Accelerate Cancer Research, we propose to expand on the parent R01 and employ the IMAT-funded meditope antibody technology to quantitatively monitor in vivo and non- invasively the efficacy of HER2 receptor-targeted drug delivery systems using macroscopy fluorescence lifetime imaging (MFLI)-FRET imaging. We will establish and optimize an antibody-to-target imaging pipeline to quantitatively monitor the binding of near-infrared labeled anti-HER2 meditope antibodies to their respective targets (target engagement) in heterogeneous breast tumor microenvironments. NARRATIVE Following an ever-increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities, especially to guide the development and optimization of HER2 targeted therapies in breast cancer.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,10411403,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,102875
"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.

"Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon Project Summary/Abstract: As cancer becomes an increasingly important cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, nations must improve their capacity to diagnose and treat the malignancies that most affect their populations. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality for women in Cameroon, where two thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and five-year survival rates are less than 30%. A longstanding collaboration between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles (the MBLA partnership) plans to conduct key stakeholder interviews in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a breast cancer screening program that is initially offered to high-risk women. Risk-based screening aims to equitably target early screening efforts while ensuring that diagnostic and treatment capacity are sufficient to manage lesions identified through screening. Such a program requires a breast cancer risk prediction model that is applicable and acceptable to Cameroonian women and feasible to evaluate through a community-based screening program. Studies in the United States, Asia, and Nigeria demonstrate that breast cancer risk prediction models perform best when they are ethnic group-specific, but no breast cancer risk prediction model has been developed for Cameroonian women. The African Breast Cancer case-control Study (ABCS) contains breast cancer risk factor information for women from Nigeria, Uganda, and a small subset of women from Cameroon. Traditional approaches to risk prediction will likely suffer from small sample size in models trained on Cameroon data only or from bias in models trained and validated on the full, ethnically diverse dataset. In Aim 1, a subgroup-specific cross-validation method will be incorporated into the Super Learner ensemble prediction algorithm to develop a breast cancer risk prediction model that incorporates all ABCS data but is optimized for Cameroonian women. Aim 2 addresses MBLA members’ concerns that certain risk factors from ABCS will be difficult to evaluate by community survey. Targeted learning methods will be used to define metrics for comparing risk prediction models including and excluding these variables so that Cameroonian stakeholders can evaluate whether to include these risk factors in their breast cancer risk prediction model. In Aim 3, an R shiny app will be developed, tested, and optimized in order to facilitate use of a Cameroon-specific breast cancer risk model in a future screening program. The methods developed and tested in this project could help to optimize cancer risk prediction models for other ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of the MBLA collaboration, UC Berkeley’s leaders in the field of targeted learning, and the UCSF Global Cancer Program. By providing protected time for training, research, and career development, this grant will facilitate the applicant’s progress towards becoming a breast surgical oncologist researching methods of improving access to cancer care in Africa. Project Narrative: In response to rising rates of breast cancer in Cameroon, a partnership between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles plans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a risk-based breast cancer screening program in Cameroon. This project aims to develop a method for defining a breast cancer risk prediction model optimized for Cameroonian women that makes use of information from a large, ethnically diverse case-control dataset and to provide Cameroonian stakeholders with information needed to select which risk factors to include in a Cameroon- specific breast cancer risk model. These methods could be used to define optimal cancer risk prediction models for ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally.",Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon,10141952,F32CA257350,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Asia ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Cameroon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Study models ', ' mortality ', ' Nigeria ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Uganda ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Logistics ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Surgical Oncologist ', ' Oncologic Surgeon ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' breast cancer registry ', ' screening ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Research Assistant ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Nigerian ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' early screening ', ' screening program ', ' risk prediction model ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2021,76436
"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",10112098,R01CA204320,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', '

"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cytology ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Flecks ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' analog ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Incidental Findings ', ' Modeling ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Security ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' mental representation ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management.

"Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Metastasis causes >90% of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. Outcomes will reveal new invadopodia-related targets, which can be used to prevent metastasis in breast cancer.",Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis,10151585,R01CA230777,"['Actins ', ' Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Locomotion ', ' Metalloproteases ', ' Metallopeptidases ', ' Metalloproteinases ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' protease E ', ' Extracellular Matrix Proteins ', ' G1 Phase ', ' First Gap Phase ', ' G1 period ', ' Gap Phase 1 ', ' cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B ', ' CDK inhibitor p27 ', ' CDKN1B protein ', ' CDKN4 protein ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27 ', ' Kip1 protein ', ' p27 Kip1 protein ', ' p27 protein ', ' p27-Kip1 ', ' p27Kip1 protein ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinases ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinases ', ' cdk Proteins ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' intra-vital microscopy ', ' intravital microscopy ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' CTTN ', ' CTTN Gene ', ' Cortactin Gene ', ' EMS1 ', ' cortactin ', ' ems1 sequence (mammary tumor and squamous cell carcinoma-associated (p80/85 src substrate)) ', ' EMS1 gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' MMP14 ', ' MT1-MMP ', ' Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 ', ' Membrane-Type Matrix Metalloproteinase 1 ', ' Membrane-Type Matrix Metalloproteinase 14 ', ' MMP14 gene ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' Proliferating ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Extracellular Matrix Degradation ', ' G1 Arrest ', ' G1 Block ', ' Scaffolding Protein ', ' Modification ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' loss of function ', ' intravital imaging ', ' intra-vital imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Structural Protein ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,379870
"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many lives.",Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone,10115009,R01CA248491,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ',
