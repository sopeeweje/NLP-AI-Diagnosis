"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",10191006,U24HL138998,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old

"Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs ABSTRACT  Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, 34% had been in more than one placement and 11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. With the Family First Prevention Act, states will be required to pay the average $88,000 per year to keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific level of care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM) has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling, SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health outcome data for clients using baseline characteristics. Initial models predicted more than 30% of the outcome variance (i.e., it was possible to predict 30% of the variance in how depressed a client would be at follow-up). The next model improved that prediction to more than 50%, and our latest model has increased this to an average of 71%. With the assistance of Phase I NIH SBIR funding, we plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-derived product called “Placement Success Predictor.” To guide level-of-care decision-making, this product will use site-customized, machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an adolescent having a good outcome in a particular placement type in a specific community. We have preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of developing these models based on work supported by the Duke Endowment Foundation. During this six-month Phase I project, we propose to 1) validate these preliminary machine learning models by applying them to new client data from our partner behavioral health organization, 2) explore options for sharing results of these models to facilitate their use in practice (e.g., aggregate predictions across different domains in a weighted way), 3) assess key stakeholder satisfaction with a new prototype, and 4) develop and test customized models for multiple placement types with a state-wide child welfare and juvenile justice dataset. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hundreds of thousands of children were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, approximately one out of 10 were placed in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these vulnerable children because some placements, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the proposed “Placement Success Predictor” tool will help placement staff and administrators identify the best placement setting for each child using machine-learning statistics to predict the child’s chances of success in each potential treatment setting.",Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs,10138072,R43MH125486,"['Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Endowment ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Group Homes ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Justice ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Team Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Managed Care ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Friction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' foster care ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' maltreatment ', ' mistreatment ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' care costs ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,OUTCOME REFERRALS INC,R43,2021,207514
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot

"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Control Groups ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' elder maltreatment ', ' elder mistreatment ', ' elderly abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Family ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospital Departments ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Influentials ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"A multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy in Tuberculosis ABSTRACT The rapid spread of multi-drug resistance has created a great need for new combination therapies to treat a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases and cancer. In one pressing example, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) affects about 500,000 people each year and novel drug regimens are sorely needed. However, identifying new regimens has been daunting in part due to the inability to prioritize among a very large number of possible drug combinations. To address this need, we have generated an experimentally grounded, machine learning algorithm, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts the synergy or antagonism of TB drug combinations with high accuracy. Here we propose to adapt INDIGO-MTB into a multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy and drive preclinical regimen development for TB. We will build in and validate the ability to predict drug interactions under stressful environmental conditions that mimic TB infection, and extract molecular mechanisms of drug interactions. We will then combine synergy and efficacy measurements to create new regimen rankings, which we will validate both in vitro and in a mouse model of TB infection. Altogether, our work will establish a tool for rapid assessment of TB drug combinations and a framework for applying this approach to other conditions where new multidrug therapies are needed. NARRATIVE Tuberculosis is a massive public health problem, and new drug regimens are sorely needed. To address this need, we are assembling a multifactorial pipeline of experiments and computation to understand how drugs interact and to drive regimen development for TB.

"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture.

"Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects ~1% of the population. Progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of ASD through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies that have identified several loci associated with ASD. However, a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. There are multiple reasons to expect that DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation. First, part of the ASD-related genes identified via DNA sequence variation include genes involved in chromatin modification and DNAm. Second, ASD likely originates during prenatal development, a period of dynamically regulated changes in DNAm in the brain. As this remodeling may result in epimutations that can dysregulate brain function, disruption of the DNAm regulation in utero represents a plausible ASD risk mechanism. Third, ASD is associated with several neonatal and other environmental risk factors. Because DNAm can be modified by environmental factors, it may mediate the effect of these risk factors on ASD.  The overall aims of this project is to enhance our understanding of DNAm in ASD etiology, and use DNAm marks at for early detection of individuals at risk for ASD. For this purpose we will generate methylome-wide data using samples from ASD cases age 18-25 years and matched controls from an existing Swedish case- control study called Population-based Autism Genetics and Environment Study. In addition, we will use stored neonatal blood samples to generate a second methylation profile for these same individuals at birth. Thus, we will have methylome-wide data from blood for two time-points from all participants, accompanied by longitudinal phenotype information spanning birth to current date obtained from the Swedish registers.  We will use a sequencing-based approach to assay the DNAm status of nearly all 28 million common CpG sites in the human genome and will perform a battery of novel statistical analyses including methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) of whole blood and individual cell-types in blood; analyses integrating DNAm information with neonatal risk factors and already existing GWAS and WES data; and studies exploring the role of DNAm in the ASD sex-bias. Significant findings will be replicated in four existing and independent blood sample collections, and studied in the newly generated methylation/expression data from ASD brain samples. Finally, we propose to use neonatal DNAm markers to create multi-marker methylation risk scores (MRSs) for predicting ASD risk. Although, there has been ample progress in identifying genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation and, therefore, we proposed to perform methylome- wide investigations using sequencing-based DNAm data and novel statistical approaches. The successful completion of this project means that we have identified ASD associated methylation marks that will enhance our understanding of the ASD etiology and may be used for risk prediction and early diagnosis of ASD.",Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder,10098730,R01MH124981,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Methylation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' X Chromosome ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' DNA analysis ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Equation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', "" Co(beta)-cyano-7''-(2-methyl)adeninylcobamide "", ' factor A ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' DNA Methylation Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' in utero ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' Bioconductor ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' methylome ', ' genetic information ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' phenotypic data ', ' genomic epidemiology ', ' methylomics ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,764339
"Assessing Children's Screen Time with Wearable Sensor Project summary The explosion of digital technology ownership in the past decade has led to a dramatically increased screen exposure for children. In the United States, over 95% of families with children have a smartphone, TV, and desktop monitors, which has raised a growing concern about the impact of screens on children's health. Excessive screen exposure has been closely associated with increased eye problems, sleep disorders, obesity, and cognitive impairments among children. Due to these concerns, World Health Organization (WHO) has recently (April 2019) suggested that children between 2 and 4 should have less than 1 hour of sedentary screen time per day. However, there is an evidence gap between actual screen time in research and parental control and assessment from measurement tools. Existing methodologies of assessing screen exposure lack construct validity, as they heavily rely upon self-report, smartphone applications, or research technologies (e.g. eye- tracking glasses). Self-report is prone to reporting bias. Smartphone applications lack the capability of measuring cumulative, concurrent screen exposure across multiple screen types and are not able to confirm the identity of user (the same child or his/her parents). Research technologies, such as eye-tracking glasses, can be invasive to children and are limited to the measurement of regions of selective visual focus. Currently, there is no effective and minimally invasive tool that can be used to provide objective and accurate measurement of both sedentary screen use and screen exposure across multiple screen types. This project seeks to develop a wearable device and robust AI algorithms to provide objective and accurate screen time measurement for children. Aim 1 will develop a minimally invasive device and computer vision methods to detect screen exposure patterns and differentiate various screen type. Aim 2 will testify the design in a free-living environment on children. The proposed work will provide an important new tool to objectively and comprehensively measure children's cumulative and discrete free-living screen exposure in quantity and duration. We anticipate this technology will serve as a universal screen-time measurement tool and benefit parents, preschool teachers, and interest groups in their management and advocacy of child(ren)'s sedentary activities and media use. We also anticipate our tools will help academic researchers, clinical psychologist, and consumer researchers via providing objective measures in behavioral study and therapy. Project Narrative Children’s screen exposure is closely related to health issues such as increased eye problems, sleep disorders, obesity, and cognitive impairments among children. There is an unmet need to assess children’s daily screen exposure to aid the parental control and academic research on children’s development. This project will develop a wearable device and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automatically provide accurate measurements of children’s screen exposure on multiple screen device, sedentary activity, and background exposure.",Assessing Children's Screen Time with Wearable Sensor,10109724,R21HD104164,"['Visual Accommodation ', ' Ocular Accommodation ', ' Visual Focusing ', ' eye accommodation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Advocacy ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interest Group ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Ownership ', ' Parents ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' teacher ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' minimally invasive ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' sedentary activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Child Health ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R21,2021,172059
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",10102260,R01HD087363,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Organ failure ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' data registry ', ' Emergent care ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' support tools ', ' electronic registry ', ' pediatric emergency ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' Pediatric cohort ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,597143
"UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE To advance our understanding of bladder dysfunction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), this project links existing information on diabetes severity from a large NIH study to new assessments of urinary symptoms and bladder dysfunction and urine specimens for gene expression analyses. This work will contribute comprehensive critical data to expand our knowledge about the natural history and molecular mechanisms of bladder dysfunction in T1D.",UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in

"Metabolic correlates of disease activity and disability progression in pediatric MS PROJECT SUMMARY The biological processes contributing to relapses and disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) remain largely unknown. During the past decade, our pediatric MS Network has investigated risk factors in children. We have discovered that higher saturated fat and lower vegetable dietary intake may independently increase the risk of relapse in those with the disease. Our preliminary findings, consistent with the association of high fat diet with higher risk of MS relapse, suggest that higher plasma levels of three acyl-ethanolamides (endocannabinoids) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be associated with higher relapse risk in children. Lipids mediators such as oxylipins and endocannabinoids have immunomodulatory properties and some are neuroprotective. Their plasma levels are influenced among others by dietary intake, obesity status and genetic profile. Furthermore, our findings that the tryptophan pathway is associated with the risk of relapse and disease progression links plausibly to expected changes in short chain fatty acids that we plan to investigate. Although MS is less common in children, studies in this age group have several important advantages including less irrelevant exposures and comorbidities that result from aging. With previous NIH and National MS Society support, we have established a highly collaborative national research group and a unique resource that will be leveraged in this proposal to test new hypotheses. We propose state-of-the-art untargeted and targeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses to determine the association of various plasma and stool lipids and their mediators with the risk of subsequent relapse, new MRI lesions, and neurologic and cognitive impairment. Each individual has extensive demographic, clinical, MRI, genetic, food frequency and environmental exposure data. Analyses will be adjusted for possible confounders such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic profile, use of disease-modifying therapy, body mass index and serum 25(OH) vitamin D. We will also model the contribution of various metabolites in the context of adipokines, food frequency, gut microbiome profile and genetic variants that modulate plasma lipid and mediator levels. This sophisticated modelling including pathway analyses will establish which of the variables are independent predictors. Our group of collaborators with expertise in metabolomics, lipidomics, genetics, and environmental risk factors is in a unique position to significantly advance the understanding of MS pathogenesis. The findings in the proposed study will unravel biological links between diet, gut microbiome, obesity and MS course. Although longitudinal association studies do not confirm causality, they are critical to identify putative biological pathways that may contribute to disease activity and progression. Intervention studies cannot be designed if associations are unknown. Our proposed investigation has strong potential for clinical translation as we will identify biological targets that can then be tested for causality in proof-of-concept MS trials with interventions such as supplementation with live biotherapeutic products influencing metabolic pathways of interest. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our pediatric MS Network has recently discovered that diet may influence MS course: higher fat and lower vegetable intake correlate with higher risk of relapse. Our preliminary findings suggest that three degradation products from fats measured in the blood and known to increase inflammation increase the risk of MS relapses. In the proposed study, we will identify which blood and stool fats, alone or in combination, correlate with MS relapse and disability progression.",Metabolic correlates of disease activity and

"Cause and effect of transient changes in stress, gene expression, and RV fiber orientation during RV remodeling, and its impact on RV function and inter-ventricular coupling in pulmonary hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiopulmonary disease that ultimately leads to right ventricular (RV) failure. Currently there are no approved therapies targeting the RV and most research is focused on reducing fibrosis, although it is unclear if this will ultimately improve RV pumping function. However, the orientation of collagen and cardiomyocyte fibers likely have a major influence on RV function and are largely overlooked in ongoing research and clinical practice. Furthermore, the role of the LV in RV function is almost completely discounted, but previous research from the 90’s has suggested that the left ventricle (LV) is more important for RV function than the contracting RV free wall.  Our previous data has shown that the mechanics of LV contraction is drastically different in children with PH and in mice after pulmonary arterial banding (PAB). Furthermore, mathematical simulations of the heart in our lab have shown that the mechanical burden of the remodeling and pressure-overloaded RV can result in the mechanistic problems we see in both ventricles in children with PH. However, two critical questions remain unanswered: how do changes in RV structure impact RV and LV contractile mechanics, and how do these changes in LV contractile mechanics impact RV function?  In this study, we will combine the PAB mouse model with in silico simulations to investigate how changes in RV fiber orientation and stiffening, in the RV free wall, impact RV pumping function. Then, we will combine PAB with aortic constriction to study how RV remodeling interferes with LV torsion and if this interrupts LV-to-RV mechanical assistance during systole. Finally, by collecting a time course dataset of imaging and gene expression, we will identify genes that are directly impacted by changes in mechanical stress and how they trigger their downstream remodeling pathways.  By bridging the gap between gene expression, structure, function, and inter-ventricular contractile mechanics, this project could lead to a better understanding of adaptive vs. maladaptive remodeling pathways. Furthermore, our research is focused on identifying those remodeling characteristics with the biggest influence on function and could expose gene expression pathways that will serve as drug targets in future studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease with a high mortality rate due to ultimate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure. The overall hypothesis of this project is that a cascade of RV fiber re-orientation and changes in left ventricular (LV) contractile mechanics are potential targets to halt or reverse functional decline, which have not been explored. The successful completion of this project would confirm that these are targets worth pursuing and reveal the potential transcriptional and structural changes that could be exploited.","Cause and effect of transient changes in stress, gene expression, and RV fiber orientation during RV remodeling, and its impact on RV function and inter-ventricular coupling in pulmonary hypertension",10209842,R56HL152250,"['Animals ', ' Catheterization ', ' Cathetergram ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Collagen ', ' Diffusion ', ' Energy Transfer ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Heart ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myosin Heavy Chains ', ' myosin heavy chain ', ' pressure ', ' Pulmonary Heart Disease ', ' Cor pulmonale ', ' Pulmonary Heart Disorder ', ' cardiopulmonary disease ', ' cardiopulmonary disorder ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Systole ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' connectin ', ' titin ', ' Right Ventricular Function ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic intraventricular pressure ', ' Intraventricular Pressure ', ' Ventricular Pressure ', ' Fiber ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Right ventricular structure ', ' Right Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Right Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Ventricle Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Cardiac Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Myocardial Remodeling ', ' myocardial remodeling ', ' Ventricular Remodeling ', ' LV remodeling ', ' left ventricle remodeling ', ' Left Ventricular Remodeling ', ' MMPs ', ' Matrix Metalloproteinases ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adhesion Plaques ', ' Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions ', ' Focal Contacts ', ' Focal Adhesions ', ' protein expression ', ' Torsion ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' clinical practice ', ' constriction ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Geometry ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' preservation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R56,2021,404365
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI. This study will use the tool to target antimicrobial stewardship CDI-prevention bundle recommendations toward patients at highest risk who are missed by current case finding strategies and investigate whether this will decrease rates of CDI.",Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI),10208953,R03HS027208,[''],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R03,2021,62445
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible.

"Imaging biomarkers of severe respiratory infections in premature infants Phase II ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict the risk and assess the severity of LRTI in premature babies are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Our goal is to improve clinical practice by developing an objective framework to predict the risk and assess the severity of respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging biomarkers and clinical parameters.  In the Phase I of this project, our multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists, neonatologists and imaging and machine learning specialists developed an imaging software technology called Lung Aeration and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR). Our accomplishments include: 1) establishing a curated ground truth of focal findings in chest X-Ray (CXR) of premature babies; 2) developing a machine learning algorithm to automatically localize and quantify CXR-based prematurity lung disease signatures (fibrosis/interstitial opacities, cystic changes and hyperinflation); 3) creating a graphical user interface for clinical deployment; and 4) evaluating our imaging software technology in an independent cohort. We also demonstrated that the imaging biomarkers obtained by LungAIR correlate strongly with the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)—the most common respiratory complication of prematurity-- and the cumulative exposure to supplemental O2 and mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (p<0.001). Importantly, our preliminary results indicated that the combination of imaging and clinical markers (BPD severity) provide an accurate predictive model for LRTI-related complications in the first year of life (AUC=74, p<0.01).  This Phase II project builds on the findings and methodology developed in Phase I. In Specific Aim 1, we will incorporate a model of lung disease risk factors in LungAIR platform. Our software will ingest respiratory support information daily during NICU hospitalization and integrate the data with CXR analysis. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend LungAIR to perform longitudinal analyses during hospitalization with the potential to accelerate the prediction of health risks. We will also integrate our results with the electronic health record of the patient for improve the clinical workflow. In Specific Aim 3 we will conduct a clinical study to prospectively evaluate the LungAIR clinical platform functionality. The proposal includes the business model and a path to commercializing LungAIR. The early identification of premature babies at high risk for BPD and severe LRTI should improve their outcome, reduce hospitalization times and inherent clinical costs, and decrease infant mortality. In addition, the ability to objectively quantify and track lung imaging biomarkers will also guide therapy and clinical trials, as well as improve the longitudinal monitoring of infants.

Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Birth Certificates

"14/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' kidney infection ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' kidney cortex ', ' kidney cortical portion ', ' renal cortex ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Pyelonephritis ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Societies ', ' Statistical Study ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' DMSA ', ' 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid ', ' 2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic Acid ', ' Dimercaptosuccinic Acid ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Toddler ', ' Imaging problem ', ' response ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' renal scarring ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' denoising deep learning ', ' de-noising deep learning ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10246291,K08HL148178,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', '

"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative: In this application we propose to study COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 virus in the unique risk population of Kidney transplant recipients. Using data and bio-samples from two hospital systems at the forefront of this pandemic and the highest COVID-19 case loads, we wil identify clinical and biomarker risk profiles for disease severity in transplant patients with COVID disease. In addition, we will use novel assays for humoral and cell-mediated immunity to study COVID immune responses in these immunosupppressed patients and compare with controls.",Multiparametric mapping of

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome. The major goals of our project are to (1) develop computational modeling techniques to design perturbations that can steer the microbiome to desired states and (2) design next-generation bacterial therapeutics that sense major gut microbiome-produced metabolites and deliver selective antimicrobials to shift microbiome states to ameliorate CVD.",Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease,10249177,R01EB030340,"['Bacteriophages ', ' Phages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Bacteroides ', ' Behavior ', ' Butyrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Feedback ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' alimentary tract ', ' digestive canal ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' lysin ', ' trimethylamine ', ' N,N-dimethylmethanamine ', ' Mediating ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' sensor ', ' Stimulus ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Probiotics ', ' Performance ', ' microbial ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' microbiome alteration ', ' alter microbiome ', ' microbiome adaptation ', ' microbiome perturbation ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,667219
"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10248554,R01HD101842,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Learning Disorders ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Sample Size ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Disabled Children ', ' Children with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped Children ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' Services ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Reading disability ', ' Reading Disabilities ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reader ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' language impairment ', ' random forest ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,637749
"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",10125199,R44MH118763,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Care ', ' baby care ', ' infant health care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' newborn care ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Siblings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Validation ', ' Software Verification ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' neurobehavioral test ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' brain morphology ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Age-Months ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' neurobehavioral disorder ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social communication ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' verification and validation ', ' cloud based ', ' cognitive ability ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' patient variability ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2021,1447880
"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation. She will develop new knowledge and skills in clinical, translational, and computational research and generate new hypotheses and data that will provide the basis for future independent lines of investigation. With the support of her division, mentors, and scientific advisory committee and the resources available at her institution, the candidate is ideally positioned to achieve her goal of becoming a successful independent investigator in the epidemiology and epigenetics of asthma and allergic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist and are the most common respiratory diseases globally, yet it remains unknown why these two diseases often develop concomitantly and why patients with comorbid disease have worse control of asthma symptoms and more frequent and severe asthma exacerbations.

"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Injury Severity Score ', ' ISS Score ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Organ Failure ', ' MOF syndrome ', ' Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ', ' multiorgan failure ', ' multiple organ system failure ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Work ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' APACHE II ', ' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' Glossary ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' resilience ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Trauma patient ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' biomarker development ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' infection risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' clinical database ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,10085674,R01LM012973,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' data resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' machine translation ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,366696
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases.

"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic

"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,10208649,R01MH117998,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Motion ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Behavioral ', ' somatosensory ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,796501
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,10215480,R01DK089201,"['Animals ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' Genotype ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' fetal ', ' Maternal Nutrition ', ' Maternal diet ', ' maternal nutrition during pregnancy ', ' mother nutrition ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' offspring ', ' validation studies ', ' diet control ', ' dietary control ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Histone Code ', ' Phenotypic Sex ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' fetal programming ', ' microbiome ', ' metagenome ', ' epigenomics ', ' oral microbiome ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' epigenome ', ' genomic variation ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' High Fat Diet ', ' predictive signature ', ' maternal obesity ', ' maternal adiposity ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translational impact ', ' microbiome research ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' maternal microbiome ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' microbiome alteration ', ' alter microbiome ', ' microbiome adaptation ', ' microbiome perturbation ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' maternal condition ', ' advanced analytics ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' microbiome signature ', ' ']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,637564
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families.

"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe.

"Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children Project Summary: While strong empirical evidence shows that exposure to food advertisements increases short-term food intake and contributes to the development of obesity, not all children are susceptible to this effect. Identifying the characteristics that protect some children from overeating in response to food advertising is a public health priority that may highlight novel targets for childhood obesity prevention. We propose to use state-of-the art, data driven techniques to identify neural, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes that are associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect children from weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The driving premise of this proposal is that children who are resistant to food-cue induced overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits which protect them from weight gain in an obesogenic environment. Our preliminary studies suggest that greater neural activation in prefrontal cortical regions implicated in cognitive control, increased executive functioning, and lower food advertising exposure may be some of the characteristics that confer resiliency to overeating in response to food advertising cues. To confirm our preliminary findings, we plan to enroll 140, 7-8 year-old children with healthy weight who vary by risk for obesity (70 low-risk/both parents with healthy weight; 70 high-risk/both parents with obesity) for a 1-year prospective study. In aim one, we will compare the effect of exposing children to commercials (i.e., food, toy, and non-rewarding advertisements) on subsequent neural activation and network connectivity characteristics in response to viewing high-energy food cues. We hypothesize that exposure to food commercials (vs. toy and non-food) will reduce prefrontal cortex activation, but that there will be substantial variability in this response across children. In aim two, we will determine how food commercials affect children’s subsequent food intake at both homeostatic (i.e., ad libitum test-meals) and non-homeostatic (i.e., eating palatable snacks when not hungry) eating events and relate these responses to underlying neural circuitry. In aim three, we will test the extent to which children’s executive function and prior food advertising experience moderate the relationship between food commercial exposure and subsequent neural and behavioral outcomes. In the final aim, we will use sophisticated data-driven techniques (i.e., machine learning) to identify neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of familial risk status on weight-gain. We expect the proposed studies to inform the science of obesity prevention by identifying specific modifiable phenotypes that protect high-risk children from excess weight gain during the pre-adolescent period. The overall impact of these studies will be to identify novel neural and behavioral characteristics of resiliency to food advertising in children. It will be the first to focus specifically on characterizing neural resiliency factors associated with decreased risk of food-cue induced eating and determine the extent to which these factors protect pre-adolescent children from the development of obesity. Project Narrative: Reducing excess food consumption in response to food advertising is a public health goal for preventing excess weight gain and the development of obesity in children. Food marketing is a major contributor to childhood obesity, and the proposed research will identify neurobiological and behavioral characteristics that protect some children from overeating in the presence of this cue. These findings will have direct implications for the development of more effective strategies to reduce energy intake for the prevention of obesity.",Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children,10049781,R01DK126050,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Toy ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Structure of postcentral gyrus ', ' Postcentral Gyrus ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' pre-adolescent ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Palate ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Advertisements ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' approach behavior ', ' food marketing ', ' food ads ', ' food advertising ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' somatosensory ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' eating in absence of hunger ', ' public health priorities ', ' healthy weight ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' obesity development ', ' neural network ', ' health goals ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' excessive weight gain ', ' extreme weight gain ', ' serious weight gain ', ' severe weight gain ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,603724
"Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Trauma is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-trauma risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. Moreover, urban racial/ethnic minorities can experience significant environmental stress that puts them at particularly high risk for PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of risk specific to urban racial minorities, or that takes into account how disadvantage and minority stress may impact neurobiological stress systems in the months following trauma, and how that affects risk for long-term distress. Thus, under the guidance of a community advisory board our team will 1) identify acute post-trauma neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD among urban Black Americans, with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat, 2) characterize how the longitudinal interaction of socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors and biological stress markers following trauma impacts risk, and 3) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of neuroimaging, biomarkers, self-report and geocoded risk and resilience variables. We will recruit 190 adults who identify as Black or African American from the Emergency Department at Froedtert Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months following trauma exposure. The two-week and 12-month assessments will include measures of neural systems for threat processing, including both anticipation of and reactivity to threat. All visits will include measures of PTSD and other symptoms, neurobiological stress markers, particularly endocannabinoids, and socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors, especially those relevant for urban Black Americans. We will examine how acute post-trauma neurocircuitry variables (2 week) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later, and how pre-trauma environmental variables (resource deprivation, child maltreatment, violence exposure) moderate this relationship (Aim 1). We will also assess how, in the months following trauma, socio-environmental risk and resilience factors influence neurobiological stress systems, and how this interaction impacts risk for PTSD, poor physical health, and emotion regulation neurocircuitry at twelve months (Aim 2). We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified predictors (Aims 1 and 2), as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses (Aim 3). This approach will allow for determination of the additional utility of neurobiological markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of PTSD following trauma for urban Black Americans at high risk that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant neurobiological stress response) that can inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban Black American trauma survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying factors that contribute to risk or resilience for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem, particularly for urban racial minorities who are at high risk and experience significant chronic socioenvironmental stress. This work seeks to identify whether dysregulation in emotion regulation neural circuitry two weeks following trauma predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later among urban Black adults. Moreover, we will examine how environmental risk (e.g., discrimination) and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood cohesino) in the months following trauma impact neurobiological stress systems and how this interplay impacts neural health and risk for chronic distress. These data will advance our understanding of both socioenvironmental and neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of trauma.",Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors,10379585,R01MH128982,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human

"Opportunities to optimize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia: A Mixed Methods Approach PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed project will provide critical information to inform the development and implementation of interventions to improve the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia. National guidelines strongly recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive routine screenings and be offered preventive medications to reduce the risk of serious complications including infections, strokes, and pain crises. Although these complications are associated with increased health services utilization and cost, and reduced quality of life, only 40% of children receive routine screenings and less than 20% receive preventive medications. Significantly, the mechanisms driving quality gaps in the receipt of preventive services are unknown, limiting our ability to develop and implement impactful interventions. The overall objective of this study is to shed light on these mechanisms and identify opportunities to optimize receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia, thus reducing disease burden and improving quality of life. The proposed study directly impacts the following AHRQ priority populations: children, racial and ethnic minorities, low-income patients, and those with special healthcare needs. As such, it aligns with AHRQ’s mission to improve efficiency and quality of health care delivery for vulnerable populations.  Using a mixed methods approach, we will (1) identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery system, as well as key subgroups of the population, through which intervention can improve the receipt of preventive services for children with sickle cell anemia; (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of receipt of preventive services, and (3) integrate the quantitative findings of patterns of care and adherence deficiencies with the qualitative findings of barriers and facilitators to preventive services to identify intervention targets and strategies that are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services. The mixed methods approach includes analyzing data from three large complementary, nationally representative datasets, combined with primary qualitative data collection. The datasets provide a novel opportunity to provide a population-based perspective on the care of children with sickle cell anemia, as well as national data on prescribing practices. Quantitative methods, including machine learning and time-dependent survival analysis, will enable us to characterize patterns of care associated with receipt of preventive services, as well variation in adherence across providers, patients, caregivers, and insurance type. Qualitative, key informant interviews with provider teams, caregivers, and patients will identify potential barriers to and facilitators of adherence to each preventive service, as well as opportunities for intervention. Finally, the visual integration of the quantitative analysis with the qualitative findings through a joint display will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among children with sickle cell anemia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among children with SCA. We will use quantitative methods to identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery system, as well as key subgroups of the population, that can be intervened upon to improve the receipt of preventive services, and qualitative methods to identify barriers and facilitators to receipt of these services. We will integrate the findings from the quantitative analysis with the results from the qualitative analysis to fill the gap in understanding specific targets within the healthcare system, key population subgroups, and feasible strategies for interventions to maximize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia.",Opportunities to optimize the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia: A Mixed Methods Approach,10294429,R01HS027785,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,395994
"Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically, contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem. Project Narrative: Infections associated with cystic fibrosis, and other polymicrobial infections, are still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Here we propose to apply bioinformatics, modeling and experimental tools to a large clinical data set to gain new insight into how to treat complex, chronic polymicrobial infections.",Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway,10293007,R01AI155424,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Energy-Generating Resources ', ' energy source ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sputum ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' Staph aureus ', ' Streptococcus ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' pulmonary function ', ' lung function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial agent ', ' anti-microbial drug ', ' antimicrobial agent ', ' antimicrobial drug ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' success ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' FEV1 ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Dose ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Microbial Physiology ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' feeding ', ' pulmonary function decline ', ' lung function decline ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' cystic fibrosis airway ', ' CF airway ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' Regimen ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Genetic study ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translational impact ', ' Culture-independent methods ', ' culture-independent analyses ', ' culture-independent approaches ', ' culture-independent molecular techniques ', ' culture-independent techniques ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' antibiotic tolerance ', ' tolerance to antibiotics ', ' tolerate antibiotics ', ' bacterial community ', ' Lung infections ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' polymicrobial disease ', ' cystic fibrosis infection ', ' CF infection ', ' infection in CF ', ' infection in cystic fibrosis ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ', ' P. aeruginosa infection ', ' infected with P. aeruginosa ', ' infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' polymicrobial biofilm ', ' mixed species biofilm ', ' multi-microorganism biofilm ', ' multispecies biofilm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIAID,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,466513
"Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder Project summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually diagnosed early in childhood. Understanding the developmental curves of brain functions in typically developing children and children with ASD will help to understand the brain correlates of ASD. In this project, we will analyze functional MRI (fMRI) data of more than 1,000 children and adults to portrait brain developmental curves. FMRI has been commonly used to study brain functions in action. Usually, participants are asked to do some strictly designed tasks on a computer, or simply lay in the scanner without thinking a thing in particular. A more natural way to perform scanning has been proposed, where the participants are asked to watch short movie clips during the scanning. However, data analysis for movie watching data becomes complicated. We have developed a novel method to examine functional communications between brain regions during movie watching. In this project, we will compare our new method with existing methods. The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will study brain developments in hundreds of typically developing children. We will compare data from movie watching and resting-state, and compare different analysis methods. The results will help us find better methods to chart the developing brain. In the second part, we will compare the developing curves between individuals with ASD and those in typically developing individuals. The data may help us to establish a better way to scan individuals of ASD, and a better way to characterize brain functions in ASD. Public health relevance Brain imaging examinations of individuals with autism spectrum disorder is challenging for both practical and theoretical reasons. This study proposes a method to study the communications between brain regions during a naturalistic movie watching condition.

"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and

"Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis Summary/Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal disorder, a type of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. Each year there are about 38,000 new UC cases with about 25-30% being children. UC is often more severe in children than adults. There is no standard regimen for managing all people with UC. Treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and surgery to remove the colon. Ideally a personalized medicine approach should be taken to tailor therapy to the individual patient based on their disease severity and predicted response. However, there is currently a lack of guidance to clinicians as to which children are going to do well with these medications and who needs more medication exposure or surgery. To address this important issue, a clinical trial of standardized medical therapy was launched enrolling 428 children newly diagnosed with UC at 29 pediatric medical centers in North America (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy: The PROTECT Study). The PROTECT study collected clinical, genetic, environment and immune factors along with biospecimens including blood, stool, and colonic tissue. It was anticipated that a combination of clinical, genetic, and immunologic tests performed at diagnosis can construct a valuable predictive model for personalized medicine which can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes such as early and late remission on 5-ASA only without the concurrent use of steroid medications. Along this line, state-of-art machine learning algorithms can ultimately utilize the PROTECT study data and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process. ML-based models will be validated with external electronic health records data. Further, there is a lack of easy- to-use clinical decision support tool to help clinicians make decisions in the ﬁeld. This study will ﬁll the gap. Project Narrative The proposed project will accurately predict early and late clinical outcomes of patients following initial standard therapy in children with ulcerative colitis. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process.",Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis,10286334,R21DK130006,"['Abdominal Pain ', ' Accounting ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colectomy ', ' Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Colon ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' immunologic substance ', ' immunological substance ', ' Immunologic Tests ', ' Immunological Tests ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Intestinal Diseases ', ' Intestinal Disorder ', ' intestine disease ', ' intestine disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"The role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans PROJECT SUMMARY Mounting evidence links the gut microbiome – the modifiable “second genome” consisting of trillions of diverse microbes that inhabit the human gut – with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans. Studies using fecal transplant in mice have raised the central hypothesis that changes of the gut microbiome and the biochemical by-products originated from these microbes may be key modulators of development of T2DM. To date, however, knowledge of the specific microbial species that drive the development of T2DM in humans remain very limited. Human studies of the gut microbiome in T2DM have largely been cross-sectional and confounded by reverse causality. Indeed, many of the gut microbiome changes observed in human T2DM have been found to be a consequence of the disease or treatments, including the medication metformin, rather than a cause of T2DM. In addition, the circulating metabolites derived from the gut microbes that contribute to the development of T2DM remain to be discovered. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest prospective study of the role of gut microbiome in T2DM using a Finnish cohort of 6921 individuals with fecal and plasma samples collected in 2002 and over 15 years of subsequent clinical follow up. This proposed study brings together a diverse team with deep expertise in the human microbiome, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, computational biology, statistical epidemiology, and diabetes pathobiology, to specifically address the key biological and clinical questions regarding the role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of incident T2DM in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The gut microbiome are key modulators of human health and disease. To date, we have a limited understanding of the specific gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.

"Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC) Abstract Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is relevant to public health as development of a predictive model that integrates salivary biomarkers with clinical and social determinants into a bedside tool will enable early identification of severe COVID-19 in children, ensure appropriate resource allocation and aid in targeted treatment.",Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and

"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review. Incorporated into our timelines are appropriate regulatory milestones intended to conform with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) programs in effect for SARS- CoV-2 diagnostics.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,10455253,K01HL148390,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Hospitalized Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates ', ' Nomascus ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' unstructured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K01,2021,140005
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",10063870,R21EB027396,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Candida albicans ', ' C albicans ', ' C. albicans ', ' C.albicans ', ' Oral candidiasis ', ' Oral Moniliasis ', ' Thrush ', ' mouth candida ', ' mycotic stomatitis ', ' oral candida ', ' Carbon ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' microbial interaction ', ' microorganism interaction ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' oral pathogen ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' Combinatorics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' fungi pathogen ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,178370
"10/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",10/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10157261,U01DK048380,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,359745
"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,10145795,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', '

"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,10148819,R01MH120093,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cephalometry ', ' head measurement ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hand ', ' Language Delays ', ' Matched Group ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Tablets ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Stimulus ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' gaze ', ' preference ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' computer design ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' motor behavior ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387238
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Large-scale profiling of microbial and metabolic interactions between C. difficile and gut microbiota using ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major antibiotic resistant intestinal pathogen that is a leading cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea and colitis which, in severe cases, can lead to death. Treatment with antibiotics frequently leads to recurrence of the infection, which is then treated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). In this case, a fecal sample from a healthy donor is transplanted into a patient with C. difficile infection, which has been shown to prevent recurrence of infections. Notably, FMT can lead to negative health outcomes including death due to the potential transmission of pathogens and uncharacterized factors in the samples. The observed efficacy of FMT suggests that commensal gut bacteria play a critical role in suppressing infection caused by C. difficile. Previous studies have elucidated specific molecular mechanisms that can influence C. difficile colonization including exploitation of key nutrients available in the inflamed gut and secondary bile acids. We postulate that there are diverse classes of ecological and molecular mechanisms mediating protection from C. difficile depending on the ecological and environmental context. Indeed, treatments of C. difficile infection based on defined microbiota have not proven successful. To elucidate the diverse classes of mechanisms, we propose to develop a droplet microfluidic workflow to construct millions of synthetic human gut communities, screen these consortia based on the abundance of C. difficile and determine species composition of the sorted “hits.” Combining this method with exo-metabolomics and machine learning techniques, we will infer microbial interactions and metabolite effectors impacting C. difficile growth. A detailed understanding of the diverse community types and metabolic properties that suppress C. difficile growth will be a major advance towards designing safe and effective treatments for this major intestinal pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The antibiotic resistant intestinal pathogen Clostrodiodes difficile (C. difficile) is the leading cause of hospital- acquired infections in the US and there are a rising number of community-acquired cases with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. To understand the complex ecological and environmental factors that impact the growth of C. difficile in the gut microbiome, we aim to develop and apply a novel method for quantifying C. difficile growth in millions of synthetic human gut microbiome communities. Equipped with this data, we will use machine learning techniques to decipher the metabolite features and microbe-microbe interactions driving C. difficile growth.",Large-scale profiling of microbial and metabolic interactions between C. difficile and gut microbiota using ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics,10193322,R21AI159980,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bile Acids ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Colitis ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal

"Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria continues to be responsible for substantial childhood mortality in Africa despite current control efforts. Developing an effective vaccine for malaria elimination is constrained by knowledge gaps in both naturally- acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. Existing vaccine candidates elicit antibodies against the target antigen but the associations between antibody functional activity and level and duration of protection are unknown. Additionally novel blood-stage antigens that could be used in future vaccines aimed at preventing symptomatic malaria have emerged (some are polymorphic), that need to be further investigated. Preferred antigens should elicit antibody functional activity that is: i) boosted with natural infection; ii) long-lasting; iii) correlated with protection; iv) not highly strain-specific, i.e., effective against a diversity of isolates. Our study aims to clarify these unknowns focusing on 12 understudied blood-stage antigens (and the alleles of those polymorphic antigens) to inform selection of antigens that could be potential vaccine candidates.  Prior studies of naturally-acquired antibody immunity have largely quantified antibody magnitude to specific proteins and have typically been limited to quantifying immune responses infrequently or at a single time-point. Because the immune profiles of individuals are dynamic and a function of exposure to infection that cannot be synchronized at the beginning of a study, these largely cross-sectional measurements obscure outcomes of interest. Furthermore, prior studies predominantly measured only magnitude of IgG responses; few have assessed the range and breath of functional activities of antibodies, and the impact of antigen polymorphisms on functional antibody activities.  The expertise of our study team, combined with access to samples collected during a longitudinal study with intensive follow-up and a comprehensive study approach, provides an opportunity to address these questions and elucidate the importance of these antigens in acquired immunity to malaria. Our study will be based on a cohort of children and adults who were seen monthly over two years in which subjects had repeated clinical and/or sub clinical malaria infections. Studying this cohort will enable us to gain new insights into the durability and boosting over time of functional antibody activity against blood-stage antigens upon natural exposure to malaria. We will also evaluate the cross-reactivity or strain-specificity of functional antibodies against alternative alleles of polymorphic antigens. Finally, we will evaluate antigens (and alleles) against which functional antibody activity is correlated with protection from symptomatic malaria and high density parasitemia, and we will seek signatures of functional responses that can accurately discriminate protected and unprotected subjects. These correlates of protection will provide endpoints for evaluating future vaccines. This may have implications for strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Development of an effective vaccine to combat malaria is hampered by knowledge gaps in malaria immunity. The general objective of our study is to inform selection of antigens for evaluation as potential vaccine candidates and establish approaches and principals that can be applied in future larger studies. We will use data from parasite genetics, new analytical approaches, and antibody functional activity targeting novel antigens that have promise as future vaccine candidates.",Longitudinal Antibody Profiles Correlated with Protection from Malaria in Malawi,10128971,R21AI151459,"['Plasmodium Infections ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Parasites ', ' Phagocytosis ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Parasitemia ', ' parasaetemia ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' receptor bound ', ' receptor binding ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' international center ', ' acquired immunity ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' vaccine-induced immunity ', ' vaccine-induced protection ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' Antibody-mediated protection ', ' Ab-mediated immunity ', ' Ab-mediated protection ', ' Antibody immunity ', ' Antibody protection ', ' antibody-mediated immunity ', ' combat ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' Antibody Response ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Specificity ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' Beds ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgM ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticides ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' ']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2021,276326
"1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check‐ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well‐baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6‐10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check‐ ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12‐24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early‐detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state‐level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program. Success of this large and clinically valid first-of-its-kind work will spark more such studies of this vital question, and through that, future pediatric best-practices guidelines for age of detection and treatment of ASD can be properly based on objective evidence and implemented nation-wide.",1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD,10120731,R01MH121595,"['Academy ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arizona ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Boston ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' early screening ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' autism community ', ' ASD community ', ' autism spectrum disorder community ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,1290640
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,10059161,R01AI128215,"['Antitubercular Agents ', ' Tuberculostatic Agents ', ' anti-tuberculosis ', ' antituberculosis ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Tolerance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' detoxification ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Measures ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' combinatorial ', ' efflux pump ', ' network models ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' Systems Development ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' novel drug combination ', ' new drug combination ', ' new pharmacotherapy combination ', ' novel pharmacotherapy combination ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2021,913527
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly

"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen).

"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs). Using both direct digital behavioral measurement via SenseToKnow-I and data readily available in the EHR, we aim to develop and validate a multimodal ASD risk assessment algorithm for use in infants (6-12 months of age) that can be deployed in the general population. RELEVANCE STATEMENT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting.

"Assessment of speech- and fine-motor coordination and their link to language in children with autism spectrum disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with motor difficulties in speech production and fine-motor tasks. Assessments of motor impairments, however, can be subjective and miss subtle and specific abnormalities. Therefore, there is a need to develop objective measures for clinicians to assess and understand speech- and fine-motor impairments in individuals with ASD. In addition, recent research suggests that difficulties with speech production, fine-motor, and oculo-motor tasks may contribute to language difficulties in ASD. The purpose of this project is to develop objective measures of speech- and fine-motor coordination in children with ASD, and to characterize the relationship between motor modalities and expressive language in ASD using these measures. We will focus on three speech subsystems: articulatory, laryngeal, and respiratory, as well as handwriting and eye movement. In a pilot study we conducted at the Lurie Center for Autism, we utilized novel coordination features developed in our lab to highlight lower complexity of coordination, or higher coupling, between and within speech subsystems in highly verbal children with ASD as compared to neurotypical controls. The analyses also indicated lower complexity of coordination during handwriting in children with ASD, suggesting there may be similar underlying mechanisms across these motor systems. In the proposed project, we will extend upon these promising results, evaluating measures of motor coordination using low-level features derived from speech, handwriting, and eye movement tasks completed by children with ASD and neurotypical controls. We will employ acoustic-to-articulatory inversion techniques to extract more physiologically accurate vocal tract articulator movements and coordination. Aim 1 uses measures of coordination to characterize the complexity of speech- and fine-motor coordination in children with ASD. We will also determine the features which provide the highest discriminatory ability between children with ASD and neurotypical controls using machine learning models. We expect that identification of patterns of complexity and important discriminatory features will provide a better understanding of the dependencies across and within motor subsystems, which could be used for objective assessment and tracking of motor difficulties in ASD. Aim 2 characterizes the relationship between speech- and fine-motor skills and expressive language ability. We will evaluate correlations and regressions between measures of motor coordination and scores on assessments of expressive language. We believe that motor tasks and features which show high correlations with evaluations of language ability will provide further insight into how motor modalities are associated with language difficulties in ASD. In summary, this proposal aims to quantify and understand speech- and fine-motor coordination challenges in ASD using objective measures of motor coordination, and aims to characterize the relationship between speech- and fine- motor subsystems and expressive language in ASD. This project works towards our long-term goal of developing a platform to assess, understand, and track motor and communication challenges in children with ASD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children in the United States. Children with ASD typically display challenges with speech- and fine-motor coordination, which have also been hypothesized to contribute to expressive language difficulties in this population. In this project, we aim to develop objective measures of motor coordination challenges across speech, handwriting, and eye movement tasks and aim to assess their relationship with clinical measures of expressive language in children with ASD.",Assessment of speech- and fine-motor coordination and their link to language in children with autism spectrum disorder,10381787,F31DC019509,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Articulators ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Handwriting ', ' Language ', ' Larynx ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' voice box ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' respiratory ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' sensory motor system ', ' sensorimotor system ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' ocular motor ', ' ocularmotor ', ' oculomotor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical predictors ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' MTBI ', ' mild TBI ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' language outcome ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' ']",NIDCD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2021,33799
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders.

"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10377784,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,49505
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) cause more than 13,000 infections in U.S. inpatients annually, with mortality rates that can exceed 50%. In hospitals, asymptomatic colonization is emerging as a critical target for CRE infection prevention: epidemiologically, early identification of colonized patients can reduce intra-hospital spread. And clinically, colonized inpatients face significantly higher — but potentially modifiable — risks of CRE infection. Due to diagnostic limitations, however, widescale CRE colonization screening remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals. Prediction models offer alternative strategies for identifying patients at high risk of colonization and of subsequent infection. However, models face two methodological obstacles, limiting their wider utility: (1) strong colonization risk factors are “locked” in electronic health record (EHR) free-text that is unavailable for model-building unless records are reviewed manually; and (2) due to low CRE prevalence, most statistical models can only evaluate limited numbers of candidate variables. We propose to exploit state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients. We will apply these methods to EHRs from >21,000 patients screened for CRE at The University of Maryland and The Johns Hopkins hospitals. In Aim 1, we will build and validate NLP algorithms on admission histories to detect pre-admission exposures that are strong colonization risk factors but poorly captured in structured EHR data fields. NLP is a cutting-edge computational technique for “unlocking” these types of unstructured data. We will also use text-mining approaches to identify potential new or local CRE risk factors. In Aims 2 and 3, we will build and validate models from NLP-derived variables and other EHR data to predict colonization at admission (Aim 2) and progression to infection (Aim 3) using machine learning algorithms that excel on high-dimensional data. Taken together, this work will help hospitals identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when deleterious patient outcomes are still preventable. Because NLP is automated, successful models could be exported to other hospitals and integrated into EHRs; all algorithms resulting from this work will be made freely available. This will be the first study to deploy NLP for bacterial carriage screening and the largest U.S. study to follow CRE-colonized inpatients for infection. As a PhD-trained epidemiologist with a CRE and machine learning background, and who previously practiced FDA law, I am drawn to interdisciplinary, rigorous approaches and policies for reducing the toll of antibiotic resistance in hospitalized patients. In the short-term, Career Development Award support would allow me to build experience using sophisticated computational approaches for EHR-based information extraction and predictive modeling. In the long-term, the skills I acquire would position me as a leader at leveraging novel health information technology tools to design and test new strategies for responding to the threat of antibiotic resistance and other emerging pathogens in U.S. hospitals. Project Narrative Asymptomatic colonization (i.e., carriage) with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), a type of highly drug-resistant bacteria, poses urgent challenges in U.S. hospitals: undetected colonized patients can transmit CRE to other patients, and colonized patients themselves are at a significantly higher risk of developing CRE infections. Because widescale screening for CRE colonization remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals, hospitals miss critical opportunities to identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when it is still possible to prevent deleterious patient outcomes. We propose to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients by: (a) developing and validating natural language processing classifiers to detect established and new CRE risk factors from free-text, narrative EHR data; (b) using NLP-derived variables with EHR structured data to predict CRE colonization at admission; and (c) developing machine learning-based models to predict which CRE-colonized patients will progress to infection during the hospital stay, in order to guide precision medicine-based approaches for interventions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection,10370475,K01HS028363,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,130277
"Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a severe global health problem. TB is multifaceted, but a central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mtb to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents with potent growth inhibitory activity. This persistence in the face of immunologic and antibiotic pressure underlies several important facets of TB disease, including 1) the existence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and, in the setting of immunologic failure of LTBI control, its role in the genesis of active TB and 2) the prolonged course of TB antibiotic therapy, which requires 6 months of multidrug therapy to achieve reliable clinical cure. Rather than producing complete bacterial eradication in all treated subjects, cure following TB chemotherapy is now understood to be an antibiotic induced paucibacillary state in which prevention of relapse depends in part on poorly understood host factors. The host and bacterial determinants that mediate these two interrelated types of persistence are only partially understood, a knowledge gap the Tri-I-TBRU aims to fill. We propose a set of 3 intersecting projects and 3 cores all focused on different facets of the problem of paucibacillary TB, both post treatment and LTBI. The projects will use samples and clinical data from TB cohorts at our clinical site at GHESKIO in Port Au Prince Haiti, to examine the immunologic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, pharmacokinetic, and genetic factors that influence or predict the transition points between paucibacillary states of TB disease and active transmissible infection. These human studies will be compared and contrasted with a new mouse model of paucibacillary infection that will allow us to test mechanistic hypotheses about the host and bacterial determinants of paucibacillary disease. This work with be conducted by a team of highly collaborative investigators who have who have worked well together for several years. Tuberculosis is a major global health burden, killing more than 1.5 million people every year, despite the availability of therapy. A central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents. This project will investigate the host and bacterial determinants that mediate persistence of Mtb within its human host.","Determinants of TB control, relapse and reinfection",10268801,U19AI162568,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacillus ', ' Bacteria ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Haiti ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' pressure ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Ships ', ' Siblings ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Work ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Infection Control ', ' Mediating ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Genetic ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Anti Mycobacterial Agents ', ' antimycobacterial ', ' Antimycobacterial Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Country ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' TYK2 ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' global health ', ' Mouse Strains ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Sterilization ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' relapse risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' microbiome research ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' microbiome composition ', ' microbiome community composition ', ' microbiome species composition ', ' tuberculosis chemotherapy ', ' ']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U19,2021,2755450
"MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond  The prevalence of skin diseases is extremely high in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in children. If left untreated, some have debilitating lifelong physical disabilities and deformities, as well as social and mental effects. Among them are skin infections which are listed as members of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) by the World Health Organization and targeted for disease control globally. Many of the NTDs, including leprosy, Buruli ulcers, yaws, and lymphatic filariasis, are co-endemic in West Africa. Early detection and treatment is currently the most effective measures for their disease control. However, this is hampered by a paucity of skilled healthcare workers in the remote areas of the LMICs where they prevail. On the other hand, diagnosis of these conditions can be done with patient history and simple skin examination, without undergoing invasive examinations requiring special skills and equipment. This is very well suited to field settings in LMICs. With a targeted training, technology-assisted decision-support system and a telemedicine network, local healthcare workers could be leveraged to enhance the diagnosis and management of the skin conditions. This project proposes to do so through development and validation of an mHealth tool for skin diseases in LMICs: the ‘eSkinHealth’ application. It is a portable smartphone or tablet application that could provide: a) direct diagnostic and management assistance to healthcare workers in remote setting, and through teledermatology, b) storage of longitudinal patients records for improved follow-up, and c) organization of clinical and image data of the skin. There is a general lack of good clinical photos of skin diseases on dark skin, and collection of photos made through this project could be further used for development of photo guides for wide use and future studies on dermatology of skin of color. The purpose of the proposed research is to complete development and optimization of eSkinHealth and carry out its effectiveness studies on the field. The R21 phase of the work will assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the prototype, validation of a novel built-in wound scoring system, and standardization and optimization of dermatologic photography on dark skin. The R33 phase will evaluate the performance of the app on outcomes of surveillance and management of NTDs and further optimization of photo analysis of skin lesions on dark skin using the image optimization technology. The research will be carried out in a western-African country of Côte d’Ivoire. It will build on our previous work in surveillance of NTDs in rural Côte d’Ivoire and trainings to local healthcare workers, as well as our expertise in mHealth. It will leverage our multi-year collaboration with investigators from Côte d’Ivoire, application developers in Japan, and tropical medicine expertise from Tulane University. If successful, eSkinHealth will be instrumental in overcoming the current gaps and weaknesses in dermatological services in LMICs providing a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations, as well as contributing to the dermatology of skin of color worldwide, envisioning Skin Health for All. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the prevalence of skin diseases are very high in LMICs, especially in children, dermatological services in LMICs are lacking mainly due to lack of clinical skills, and further, ways to document and store clinical course which is important for individual patient follow-up do not exist. If there is a field-adapted platform for data collection and sharing for skin conditions allowing clinical decision support for healthcare providers onsite, and remotely through teledermatology, this could serve as a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations. In this project, we will complete the development and optimization of a powerful and comprehensive, but easy-to-use smartphone / tablet application tool that addresses these gaps, envisioning Skin Health for All.",MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and Beyond,10269622,R21TW011860,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dermatology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Filarial Elephantiases ', ' Bancroftian Elephantiasis ', ' Lymphatic Filariasis ', ' Epidemiologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic surveillance ', ' Epidemiological Monitoring ', ' Epidemiological surveillance ', ' Epidemiology Surveillance ', ' Equipment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Ivory Coast ', "" Cote d'Ivoire "", ' Japan ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leprosy ', "" Hansen's Disease "", ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Photography ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' dermal disease ', ' dermal disorder ', ' Infectious Skin Diseases ', ' cutaneous infection ', ' infected skin ', ' skin infection ', ' skin lesion ', ' Skin Manifestations ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Tropical Medicine ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Yaws ', ' Frambesia ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Case Management ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Dermatologic ', ' Dermatological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Dermatologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skin color ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Skin ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pilot trial ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' health training ', ' data sharing ', ' two-arm study ', ' 2-arm study ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' neglected tropical diseases ', ' support tools ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' individual patient ', ' Buruli Ulcer ', ' clinical decision support ', ' intelligent diagnosis ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' sharing platform ', ' wound treatment ', ' treat wound ', ' wound management ', ' wound therapeutics ', ' wound therapy ', ' teledermatology ', ' digital health ', ' effectiveness study ', ' ']",FIC,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2021,181957
"mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda Project Summary/Abstract Increased access to cesarean sections (c-sections) has contributed to the decline of maternal mortality in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA); however, as the rate of c-sections has increased, so has the rate of c-section related complications. While women who deliver vaginally in rural SSA often receive postpartum follow-up care in their homes from community health workers (CHWs), most programs require that women who deliver via c-section return to health centers or hospitals for follow-up because of the increased complexity of their care. Facility- based follow-up can be financially catastrophic and physically burdensome for mothers, leading to delays in care and increased risk for morbidity. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a safe mobile health (mHealth) tool to support CHW-led home- based follow-up for women delivering via c-section in rural Rwanda at postoperative days (PODs) 5 and 10. In the first R21 phase, we will develop a software library for an existing photo-based surgical site infection (SSI) diagnostic algorithm to run locally on a smartphone (without internet or cell network connection) (Aim 1a). We will work with Insightiv Technologies to develop the comprehensive mHealth-CHW tool, including incorporating the SSI diagnostic algorithm software library and integrating three CHW usability assessments into the design phase (Aim 1b). Finally, we will test the usability and acceptability of the new tool in a group of 30 CHWs (Aim 2). When we achieve 80% usability and acceptability, we will continue to the second phase. The R33 phase of the grant will study the validity of the mHealth-CHW tool for c-section follow-up (Aim 3) by prospectively following 450 women delivering via c-section and implementing the mHealth-CHW tool and follow- up in their homes at PODs 5 and 10. The women will then return to the hospital at POD 16 for a physical examination and we will compare diagnoses and complications identified via the mHealth-CHW tool to those from the physical exam. We will then evaluate the time-to-diagnosis for c-section complications by randomizing 1350 women to follow-up by the mHealth-CHW tool versus standard of care (Aim 4). Finally, we will assess the acceptability of mHealth-CHW follow-up in 40 women who have delivered via c-section through focus group discussions (Aim 5). We will also conduct two research training series, one in quantitative methods and one in qualitative methods, to strengthen our team's ability to lead mHealth research in the future. Project Narrative In this study, we will develop a comprehensive mHealth-community health worker (CHW) tool for cesarean section (c-section) follow-up that is usable and acceptable to CHWs in rural Rwanda. We will then assess the validity of this tool during a prospective pilot, the impact of this tool on time-to-diagnosis in a randomized trial, as well as the acceptability of the tool to mothers delivering via c-section. This research will support the ability of CHWs to provide safe, accessible, and affordable in-home c-section follow-up care to women in rural Africa, thus decreasing the physical and financial burden of facility-based follow-up for new mothers.",mHealth-Community Health Worker tool for comprehensive post-cesarean follow-up in rural Rwanda,10268606,R21HD103052,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cesarean section ', ' Abdominal Delivery ', ' C section ', ' Cesarean ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' postcesarean section ', ' post cesarean ', ' post cesarean section ', ' postcesarean ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Rwanda ', ' Ruanda ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surgical Wound Infection ', ' surgical site infection ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Health system ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' support tools ', ' postpartum care ', ' post-partum care ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' implementation fidelity ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2021,206303
"Development of a Mobile Health Personalized Physiologic Analytics Tool for Pediatric Patients with Sepsis Project Summary  Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, encompasses a continuum that ranges from sepsis to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and eventually death if untreated. Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) yet few clinical tools have been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing septic children in LMICs. There is immense potential for novel clinical tools that can help clinicians more rapidly identify children with advanced stages of sepsis (severe sepsis, septic shock and MODS), who are at highest risk for decompensation and death. Mobile health (mHealth) tools, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence techniques have rapidly proliferated for a multitude of medical applications and could serve to bridge the gap in care of critically ill patients in LMIC settings. By enabling the detection of subtle physiologic changes indicating clinical deterioration, these tools may allow clinicians to intervene earlier, better direct care, and allocate scarce resources, all without the need for advanced laboratory diagnostics or critical care infrastructure. Furthermore, remote monitoring capabilities may also prove highly valuable in improving patient care and protecting the safety of healthcare workers during times of infectious disease outbreaks such as from novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).  This proposed research will develop a context-appropriate mHealth tool linking continuous physiologic data obtained from a wearable device with a novel machine learning approach known as personalized physiologic analytics (PPA) run on a standard smartphone to provide clinicians with accurate assessments of sepsis severity and mortality risk in septic children admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Formative research among clinicians at icddr,b will be used to develop this mHealth tool incorporating the PPA algorithm with a clinical decision support and alert system for use by front-line clinicians. Finally, the tool’s feasibility, usability, and accuracy for detection of sepsis severity and MODS will be validated in a new population of pediatric patients with sepsis.  Knowledge gained from this study will greatly advance the evidence base for the use of mHealth tools and artificial intelligence techniques to help clinicians worldwide better care for critically ill children in LMIC settings earlier in the course of their disease, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis. The results of this investigational research will be used to inform a multi-center clinical trial which would seek to assess the impact of using this mHealth tool on clinical outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of this tool. This tool may also provide an effective means of assessing patient responses to various therapeutic interventions via continuous physiologic monitoring in future clinical trials. The proposed initiatives will also build a base of technical and professional expertise at icddr,b in mHealth research capacity and user-centered design. Project Narrative Worldwide, sepsis is responsible for the majority of deaths in children each year with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet few clinical tools have been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing children with sepsis in LMICs.

"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10263255,K08HS027472,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2021,143830
"Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear. We propose studies to determine the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of diabetes occurring after pancreatitis, which will provide the means to understand, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes.",Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium,10264920,U01DK127403,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Artificial Intelligence ',

"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric

"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,10225342,K01HL145021,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Limbic System ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Professional Competence ', ' career skill ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Medial ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Brain region ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,135053
"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information. The NIS will accelerate itch research and improve quality of diagnosis and treatment of itch, which will eventually help the many people who suffer from chronic itch. Relevant statement Our proposal is the first project to develop a brain activity-based biomarker for itch. Success of our proposal will eventually allow us to share an objective itch assessment using the biomarker with research institutes, hospitals and industries across the world to accelerate itch research, and improve diagnosis and assessment of itch treatment.",Development of neurologic itch signature,10193704,R21AR078940,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Antipruritics ', ' Antipruritic Agents ', ' Antipruritic Drugs ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Infant ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medicine ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pruritus ', ' Itching ', ' Pruritic Disorder ', ' Pruritis ', ' itch sensation ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Dermatologic ', ' Dermatological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' phrases ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diagnosis quality ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' global health ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' treatment effect ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' biomarker development ', ' chronic itch ', ' chronic pruritus ', ' individual patient ', ' primary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' noninvasive brain stimulation ', ' non-invasive brain stimulation ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,174695
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,10097958,K08AI125682,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Red Cell ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' immunologic substance ', ' immunological substance ', ' In Vitro ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFNγ ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Training ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Parasitemia ', ' parasaetemia ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' parasite invasion ', ' in vitro activity ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical predictors ', ' malaria transmission ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' vaccination outcome ', ' outcome following vaccination ', ' outcome following vaccine ', ' result following vaccination ', ' result following vaccine ', ' vaccination result ', ' vaccine outcome ', ' vaccine result ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2021,185224
"Image Analysis and Machine Learning Methods for Biomarkers of Age-related and Metabolic Diseases Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makrogiannis, Sokratis, Ph.D. Abstract Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function.  Modern medical imaging technologies offer the opportunity to study the composition and morphometry of human body in ways that were previously impossible. Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo on a large number of participants have enabled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions. The emergence of advanced imaging technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for identification and quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing age.  This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on identification of morphological patterns in the mid-thigh, abdomen and lower leg that will eventually lead to development of imaging biomarkers. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body and changes of its regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass, frequently termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. Also, trabecular bone structural changes are associated with osteoporosis. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US.  This work will address a technical and a clinical hypothesis. The technical hypothesis is that quantitative image analysis can accurately and robustly segment, register and fuse body composition data acquired by modern MRI and CT imaging scanners. The clinical hypothesis is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging can be used as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome manifestations. We will build on recent advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive techniques for studying the human body composition and its longitudinal changes with main applications in tissue identification and quantification at the mid-thigh, lower leg and the abdomen (aim 1). Then we will develop statistical machine learning methods to achieve timely diagnosis and prognosis of metabolic and age-related conditions including the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis, and to track the effect of interventions (aim 2).

"19/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study-Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,10164762,K23DK117061,"['absorption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Asia ', ' Bile

"8/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young

"Validation of the online Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screener (TADAS) at 18 months Project Summary Abstract The American Academy of Pediatrics has mandated identification of autism (ASD) beginning at the routine 18-month visit, based on evidence that early intervention for children with autism improves outcomes. However, the US Preventive Task Force has not endorsed that recommendation, in part because of limited validity data. This study builds on a series of studies by our group aimed at improving early autism identification. We have developed a promising novel and efficient screener for primary care called Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screen (TADAS). The TADAS was developed using machine learning to automatically determine which items to collect from the parent in each case based on data from a community sample in a previous project. Currently used autism screeners have high rates of missing children who have signs of ASD or Developmental Delay (DD) and also problematic and costly rates of over-referral. Data from our prior studies showed that TADAS had nearly three times the sensitivity (.94 vs .32) and similar specificity (.87 vs .90) to the currently recommended and most popular screen for autism (M-CHAT-R/F) and more than twice the sensitivity (.94 vs .39) and similar specificity (.79 vs .85) for developmental delay of the current standard Age & Stages Questionnaire-3tm. The TADAS also provides greater efficiencies since a difficult-to-implement recommended follow-up interview is not required and there is less parent burden in overall number of items. This proposal is to program TADAS for online delivery then validate it against diagnostic testing for ASD and DD in a new community sample of children coming for their 18-month well child visit that better reflects the U.S. population in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic status than our original study population. If our initial results are further validated in this study, screening for early ASD and DD could be much more effective with corresponding improvements in child outcomes through earlier intervention. A side benefit of the project will be an efficient Computer Adaptive Testing language screen based on existing national language abilities data that could be used independently to both track language impaired toddlers who are at risk for later development of autism as well as for general language screening in primary care. These innovative new tools are being created within an online clinical support system, called CHADIS that has additional features to assist in the entire process of early identification, referral, and tracking. CHADIS provides individualized patient education for the parent; clinician use of care coordination software connecting primary care with early intervention services with options to share data and track outcomes; as well as options for doctors to receive required Board re-certification credits for participating in autism screening quality improvement efforts. The final product and “system of care” of value to clinicians, insurers, municipalities and states. Project Narrative The American Academy of Pediatrics has mandated identification of autism beginning at the routine 18-month visit, based on evidence that early intervention for children with autism improves outcomes, but there are concerns about the accuracy of currently available screening tools at that age. This project builds on data from a previous grant showing that using machine learning algorithms individualizing presentation of items to screen for autism and developmental delay (called TADAS) dramatically improved accuracy of screening with lesser parent burden and benefits to office workflow. The proposed study is required to bring this promising tool to clinical use by programming it into our online clinical process support system (CHADIS) and then completing validation in a new community sample of toddlers weighted to be representative of the U.S. population.",Validation of the online Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screener (TADAS) at 18 months,10153564,R44HD104973,"['Academy ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Certification ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chiroptera ', ' Bats ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Language Tests ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' S Phase ', ' S Period ', ' Synthesis Period ', ' Synthesis Phase ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', "" Ch'i "", ' Qi ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Municipalities ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Early identification ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Preventive ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' case-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' demographics ', ' service intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' study population ', ' recruit ', ' early screening ', ' Medicaid services ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' online delivery ', ' delivered on-line ', ' delivered online ', ' on-line delivery ', ' Well Child Visits ', ' ']",NICHD,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,233891

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health.

"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10170244,R21AI151344,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibodies ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Vivax Malaria ', ' Plasmodium vivax Malaria ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Parasites ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphoproteins ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Plasmodium vivax ', ' P vivax ', ' P. vivax ', ' Plasmodium yoelii ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Host Defense ', ' Sporozoites ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' liver infection ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' small molecule ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' side effect ', ' infection rate ', ' rate of infection ', ' ']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,213780
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,10206210,R01HD092297,"['Affect ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Breast ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Culture Media ', ' growth media ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Industry ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mastitis ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' nutrition ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' macromolecule ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Exclusive Breastfeeding ', ' Exclusive Breast Feeding ', ' exclusively breast fed ', ' exclusively breast feeding ', ' exclusively breastfed ', ' exclusively breastfeeding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' offspring ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Gland ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' microbiome ', ' protein metabolite ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' high risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' inflammatory milieu ', ' inflammatory environment ', ' milk production ', ' produce milk ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' milk microbiome ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' bacterial community ', ' mammary ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2021,443259
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,10205977,K01MH113819,"['machine learning methodologies ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' falls ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' sensory cortex ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' sensory integration ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' peer ', ' developmental psychology ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Sensory Manifestations ', ' TEP1 ', ' TLP1 ', ' TP1 ', ' hTEP1 Gene ', ' TEP1 gene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' 7 year old ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' haptics ', ' comparative ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural patterning ', ' multisensory ', ' cognitive development ', ' sensory input ', ' support network ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' symptomatology ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,195916
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants PROJECT SUMMARY  Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post- NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.  A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE The intestinal microbiome has impact beyond the gut and the existence of a gut-brain axis has been proposed. Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This proposal will study how the changes in bacterial colonization patterns of preterm infants over time from birth until school age impact brain development, and thus school readiness and learning for these vulnerable infants.",The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants,10200392,R01HD105234,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Bacterial Genes ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Head circumference ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' high risk infant ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' myelination ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' in vivo ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' infant outcome ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' infant gut microbiome ', ' neonate gut microbiome ', ' newborn gut microbiome ', ' 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing ', ' 16S gene sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA gene sequencing ', ' 16S rRNA genomic profiling ', ' 16S rRNA sequencing ', ' 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing ', ' 16S sequencing ', ' gut-brain axis ', ' gut to brain axis ', ' gut-brain communication ', ' gut-brain interactions ', ' gut-brain relationship ', ' gut-brain signaling ', ' fecal microbiota ', ' fecal microbial community ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' intestinal barrier ', ' intestinal mucosal barrier ', ' neonatal health ', ' newborn health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,705079
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Adoption ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Incidence ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' Pre-B-Cell Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' Medicine ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' SYK ', ' Spleen Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK ', ' SYK gene ', ' CREB ', ' CREB1 ', ' cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein 1 ', ' CREB1 gene ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Leukemic Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Oncogenic ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapeutic target ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' individual patient ', ' prospective test ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse risk ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage.

"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,10073490,R00DA042127,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug use ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' youth drug use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' societal costs ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,313933
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern.

"Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy Abstract Socket augmentation after tooth extraction by placing either allograft or xenograft bone particulates in the socket is frequently applied to reduce jawbone volume shrinkage for subsequent implant placement. Socket healing after the augmentation varies largely, ranging from uneventful healing to infection, failure of bone graft integration and severe bone loss due to bacterial infection and/or local/systemic conditions. The healing duration, which dictates the timing of implant placement, is widely different as well. Currently, an arbitrary waiting time of 6 months after socket augmentation is adopted, when a 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D radiograph, along with a visual examination is performed to assess hard- and soft-tissue healing to determine the readiness and strategy for the subsequent implant surgery. However, 3D radiographs are not recommended for longitudinal use to monitor socket healing due to radiation concerns. They have lower image resolution (250-500 µm), which limits their ability to evaluate bone surface healing, and inferior soft tissue contrast. A non-radiation and point-of-care method that can evaluate both hard- and soft-tissue longitudinally is much needed for a definitive, accurate, and timely diagnosis of socket healing pathologies. A high-frequency and miniature-sized intraoral ultrasound probe that can operate on an off-the-shelf scanner has been manufactured in collaboration with industry (see support letter) by our research team. Research conducted by our group demonstrated accuracy of this probe in measuring various oral and dental structures. The central hypothesis is to develop ultrasound-based imaging to characterize and grade socket healing lesions in determining the extent and severity of disease. To test this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasonic images for bone grafting procedures of dental extraction sockets in a longitudinal clinical study (from -2 months to +6 months of graft placement). We will compare other imaging and clinical diagnostic tools for assessing hard- and soft tissue, anatomical and physiological status throughout the longitudinal study time-course. Aim 2. Develop an extended-view scan-mode for acquiring large field- of-view jawbone images and determine buccal (facial) to lingual tissue morphology. We will engage the manufacturer (see support letter) to modify the existing scanner for this dental specific application. Design goals will include the creation of an extended, large angle, field-of-view to visualize the buccal to lingual jaw bone surface and to create machine learning based measurement tools, including soft- and hard-tissue thickness and surface analysis. Successful execution of the proposed aims will result in an imaging-based tool for longitudinal socket augmentation evaluation that is based on soft- and hard-tissue features and will allow the care provider to choose deviation from current clinical procedures where indicated. This would be investigated subsequently in a specifically designed clinical trial. Narrative The goals of this investigation are to follow dental patients that require bone grafts before their dental implant is placed and to demonstrate the diagnostic opportunities that ultrasound adds to the current standard of clinical dental care. 3",Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy,10427073,R56DE030872,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' bone ', ' Bone Transplantation ', ' Bone Grafting ', ' bone transplant ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Implants ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Implantation procedure ', ' implant placement ', ' implant procedure ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Jaw ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tooth Extraction ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Dental ', ' Failure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' application of bone xenograft ', ' bone heterograft ', ' bone xenograft ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Oral ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Particulate ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' dental structure ', ' experience ', ' bone loss ', ' Structure ', ' Bone Surface ', ' Radiation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' graft healing ', ' oral care ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' bone healing ', ' bone wound healing ', ' osseous wound healing ', ' graft failure ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Wait Time ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R56,2021,642438
"The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype Project Summary Extremely little is known about neural and cognitive changes or long-term prognosis for adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) older than 50 years of age, although in the US alone hundreds of thousands of people with ASD will reach this age group in the coming decades. Cross-sectional findings suggest that new cognitive, sensorimotor, and mental health problems emerge and that accelerated brain tissue loss occurs. Functional and structural brain connectivity is also affected, as shown with resting state functional MRI and diffusion MRI.  This project aims to characterize mid- to late-life trajectories of brain anatomy and function in ASD, as well as cognitive and behavioral change, and identify risk factors that predict poor outcomes including suspected effects of declining GABA concentrations and excitatory:inhibitory imbalance in aging. The proposed renewal will leverage an existing cohort (Cohort 1) of 40-70 year olds with ASD and matched typical comparison (TC) participants. In addition, a new cohort (Cohort 2) of 50 individuals with ASD and 70 TC participants age 40-70 will be recruited. Both cohorts will be followed longitudinally, with data collection every 3.5-5 years. Extensive data will be acquired at each time-point, including multimodal MRI scans, measures of GABA concentration from MR spectroscopy, diagnostic, cognitive, and behavioral assessments, as well as medical and personal history information.  The project will pursue 3 specific aims. Aims 1 will identify alterations (and altered rates of change) in brain anatomy, function, and connectivity and relate these to behavioral changes in 3 suspected risk domains of Motor, Executive, and Affective function. Aim 2 will test for group differences and effects of age in GABA concentrations and in network integration and segregation. Aim 3 will identify behavioral and neural risk factors of adverse (or positive) outcomes (e.g. on scales of maladaptive behavior, loss of daily living skills) using machine learning, and identify ASD subgroups based on GABA levels, differential rates of change, or differential domain-specificity. Project Narrative This project will generate extensive evidence on links between brain changes and behavior in adults with autism spectrum disorders between 40 and 70 years of age, for whom relevant data are extremely limited. Some specific focus will be on neuronal excitation:inhibition balance, which changes in aging. This systematic body of evidence will provide crucial information in the quest for predictors of long-term neurocognitive success or decline in ASD, thus serving as a first step to developing interventions to protect against such decline.","The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype",10299529,R01MH103494,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2 One of the most poorly understood yet clinically important aspects of the novel COVID-19 SARS CoV2 coronavirus is the marked heterogeneity that it displays with infection severity and with development of end organ complications and mortality. SARS CoV-2 infection has a complex epidemiologic interplay with cardiovascular (CVD) and highlights this complex heterogeneity. The biology underlying this heterogeneity in CVD outcomes is poorly understood and concomitantly, clinically useful biomarkers do not currently exist to identify the highest risk patients in need of the most intense monitoring. Thus, we propose to use integrated omics and EHR data in a diverse multi-center North Carolina cohort with existing biological specimens to determine the role of inflammation, metabolism and novel molecular mechanisms, and identify biomarkers of CVD outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We propose to (1) Determine the clinical predictors of infection severity in a diverse population of individuals with CVD risk factors and SARS-CoV2 infection including evaluation of racial differences; (2) Determine the role of inflammatory, SARS-CoV-2 related, and other candidate proteins as biomarkers of infection severity and CVD outcomes in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection; and (3) Evaluate metabolic pathways in SARS Co-V-2 infection severity and CVD outcomes. The proposal has high potential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the heterogeneity between CVD and SARS CoV-2 outcomes. Importantly, it has great short-term potential for clinically important results that will lead to earlier and better identification of high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring; novel therapeutic interventions to prevent end organ complications and mortality; and diagnostic and disease-progression biomarkers. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is emerging that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and pre-existing CVD appear to have a worse severity of infection. Furthermore, CVD complications appear to be relatively common in patients with COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing CVD. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will develop the most severe infection and who will develop CVD complications. Technologies have evolved such that hundreds of proteins and other markers and millions of genetic markers can be rapidly measured in small amounts of blood. Thus, in this proposal, we will use these cutting-edge technologies in blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 from two large medical centers in North Carolina, to identify biomarkers that can tell us those patients who will have the most severe infections and those patients who have suffer CVD complications, as well as identifying the genes that may predispose patients to these complications.",Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2,10303644,R21AI158786,"['Angiotensins ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System

"Health Information Technology to Support Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Risk Assessment for Early Diagnosis Project Summary / Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children in the US (1). The economic cost of ASD is estimated to be $66 billion per year in the US, from medical care and lost parental productivity (2). Early diagnosis is crucial since it allows for early treatment and the best long-term outcome. However, identifying children at high risk for ASD at an early age is challenging due to lack of specialists. To address this problem, the project's objective is to create health information technology (HIT) using information in electronic health records (EHR) to support non-expert clinicians in identifying children at high risk for ASD. The HIT will integrate two components that provide complementary information. The first component will leverage machine learning algorithms to label EHR of children at high risk for autism. Both traditional and deep learning, potentially leveraging each other, will be evaluated while systematically tracking quality and quantity of information in EHR and their effect on performance. The second component will focus on the EHR free text and identify phenotypic behavioral expressions of diagnostic criteria as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Rule-based natural language processing will be combined with machine learning algorithms. For both components, potential algorithm bias will be investigated and corrected or documented when this is not possible. The HIT will combine results from both components through an intuitive user interface. Since it is intended to be used as a human-in-the loop decision tool, it will also provide descriptive data on performance for both components. The final HIT will be developed using rapid prototyping in interaction with domain experts. It will be evaluated in a user study with representative non-expert clinicians. The evaluation will compare accuracy, confidence, and efficiency of identifying children at risk for ASD with and without the HIT by non-ASD experts. It will also systematically focus on the type, amount, quality and transparency of information provided, and how this interacts with user beliefs about their own expertise as well as their bias toward machine decisions. Different types of EHR as well as different levels of clinical expertise will be compared for effects of HIT use. Preliminary work has been conducted for all components with good results. However, this prior work focused on version IV of the DSM and used only free text from data rich EHR. The proposed project will expand the prior work to use DSM-5 criteria, train and develop the algorithms to use structured and unstructured fields in clinical, representative EHR, and work with EHR from different hospitals to evaluate potential obstacles and advantages of variability in data. Using information in EHR, this HIT will provide support especially for non-expert clinicians in their evaluation of children who may be at risk of ASD. The HIT will support early referrals leading to early diagnosis and therapy. It will be useful in a variety of different settings where domain expertise is missing. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobiological condition with increasing prevalence for which early diagnosis is crucial but unfortunately often late or missed entirely, in large part due to lack of trained clinicians. This project will create health information technology (HIT) that uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms with electronic health records to support non-expert clinicians in identifying children at risk for ASD. The HIT will be evaluated with non-expert clinicians for the minimum and optimal requirements to help clinicians make confident and high quality decisions.",Health Information Technology to Support Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Risk Assessment for Early Diagnosis,10297910,R01MH124935,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Medical Education ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' DSM-4 ', ' DSM4 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' economic cost ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Prevalence ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' health information technology ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' improved outcome ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' adult with autism spectrum disorder ', ' adult with ASD ', ' adult with autism ', ' autistic adult ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,378122
"An integrative, data-driven, and computational approach to uncovering dynamic mechanisms of early viral infection Project Summary Cutting-edge technologies are generating large datasets across biological processes, including those following viral infection and host responses. However, lack of computational tools that can extract meaningful insights, and lack of ability to integrate information across different model systems and data modalities, are roadblocks to deriving biological and mechanistic understanding of these processes. The recent rise of devastating viruses including SARS family viruses reveals that a deeper, basic mechanistic understanding of viral infection is still lacking. Specifically, new insights into early viral infection (asymptomatic replication phase) and early-responding genes that govern infection and disease outcome are critical for understanding progression of infection and host responses. During my postdoctoral research, I developed several widely-used algorithms for biomedical machine learning and single-cell data analysis, and applied these to a broad range of biological systems, including infectious disease. Here, I propose to develop a completely new approach that is founded in cross-modal computational analysis and can be applied to dynamic processes across living systems. In this proposal, the method will be trained upon and applied to uncovering virus infection dynamics. By leveraging single-cell technologies, combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, and advanced machine learning, this new approach will learn the gene regulatory logic that governs infection. By spanning model systems, I will extract information that can be derived more cleanly from in-vitro systems, such as early infection timepoints. Through cross-integration of these data with in-vivo data from mouse models we will bring the precision questions that can be asked in human organoids together with the physiological environment of animal models, powering our ability to derive relevant insights into gene networks underlying a complex, dynamic process. I will build a single-cell atlas of virus infection and train a machine learning algorithm to obtain a predictive model of infection dynamics. By also integrating data from single-cell combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, I will infer causal gene networks as well as synergistic gene interactions that govern infection dynamics. This combination of advanced machine learning methods, large-scale single-cell analysis, and gene perturbation data will allow discovery of the drivers of infection, signatures of both susceptibility and protection, and gene networks that can ultimately be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Synergistic gene interactions will open up future paths to potentially more effective, specific, and even combinatorial therapies. The innovative coupling of computational methods and deep data collection to extract information, particularly during early infection phases, has the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of viral infections, as well as provide a framework that can be applied to a broad range of biological processes and diseases to obtain deep mechanistic understanding. Project Narrative Using data driven and computational approaches we will reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying viral infection, focusing on model systems that give insight into early, dynamic infection processes in diverse tissues, organisms, pathogens, and disease backgrounds. Gene networks and synergistic gene interactions causally related to infection will be inferred using our novel computational tools, thus uncovering signatures of protection and providing an invaluable resource for the community. The proposal promises to build approaches applicable across biological systems and processes, change our mechanistic understanding of viral infection, and, in the future, support therapeutic design.","An integrative, data-driven, and computational approach to uncovering dynamic mechanisms of early viral infection",10276969,R35GM143072,"['Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Organoids ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Guidelines ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' gene interaction ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' SARS ', ' SARS coronavirus disease ', ' SARS-CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' pathogen ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combinatorial ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' biological systems ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' single cell technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,418750
"The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition Globally, undernutrition contributes to 44% of childhood deaths under the age of five 1. Stunting, or reduced linear growth, is a major complication of undernutrition that is associated with increased risk of metabolic and infectious disease, reduced educational attainment and poor cognitive function later in life 3. Stunted mothers are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and to give birth to stunted children 5. In turn, many children that are born stunted do not recover despite current therapeutic interventions 4. Therefore, stunting is often referred to as an intergenerational syndrome, and new approaches are desperately needed to improve childhood growth in vulnerable populations. The maternal immune system plays a major role in shaping offspring physical, cognitive and immune development. The gut microbiota likewise influences both local and systemic immunity, raising the possibility that the maternal microbiome could influence fetal and childhood development. We hypothesize that maternal gut microbial composition shapes the fetal immune environment to control offspring growth and immune development during undernutrition. We propose to use a mouse model of intergenerational undernutrition to identify specific immune and microbial targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary data demonstrate that breeding mice colonized with microbiota from healthy or severely stunted donors produce offspring with divergent weight, bone, and immune developmental phenotypes that persist into maturity. We will use this model to isolate the role of the maternal gut microbiome from the neonatal microbiome, giving critical insight into the window of potential intervention. We will also identify specific subsets of microbes that are capable of influencing offspring growth and immune development and characterize microbial metabolic products associated with these changes. Finally, we will identify maternal immune cells and signaling pathways that respond to these microbial communities to control healthy growth and immune development in offspring. These experiments will identify specific microbial species as well as host immune pathways to target therapeutically and define the appropriate developmental stage in which to intervene. The Cowardin lab is located within the Child Health Research Center at the University of Virginia, and as a member of the Trans- University Miocrobiome Initiative, is uniquely suited to pursuing these studies. The lab has both the infrastructure and expertise required for successful completion of these goals. Ultimately, this proposal will lead to potential probiotic and immunotherapeutic treatments to disrupt the transmission of stunting from mother to child. Childhood undernutrition is a pervasive problem worldwide, resulting in reduced linear growth (stunting), increased risk of disease and cognitive defects that persist into adulthood. Maternal health profoundly influences fetal and childhood development, and mothers that are stunted are more likely to give birth to stunted children. Because gut microbes influence growth and immune function, we propose to investigate the role of the maternal microbiota in shaping offspring health, with the goal of identifying specific microbial species and immune pathways for targeted intervention to ameliorate the global burden of undernutrition.",The maternal microbiome in childhood growth and immunity during undernutrition,10276044,R01HD105729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' bone ', ' Breeding ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Homozygote ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mothers ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Syndrome ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' chemokine ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Adoptive Transfer ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' postnatal ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' Probiotics ', ' experience ', ' lymphocytopoiesis ', ' Lymphopoiesis ', ' intergenerational ', ' microbial ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,10079025,R01HL150044,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Base Ratios ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiology ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,10171893,K01HL148390,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Hospitalized Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates ', ' Nomascus ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' unstructured data ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2021,7558
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10206005,R01MH119114,"['Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' traumatized children ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' traumatic event ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' traumatic stress ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,604345
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,10202572,R01DK116163,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inpatients ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Rehydrations ', ' Rehydration Solutions ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' International Unit ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Techniques ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' international center ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Intravenous Fluid ', ' IV Fluid ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' clinical predictors ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' Acute Diarrhea ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2021,546783
"21/22 Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Phase 3 - One Year Extension - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,10159844,R01AI152158,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Geography ', ' glycosylation ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serology test ', ' serology assay ', ' South Africa ', ' Specificity ', ' Sputum ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Typhoid Fever ', ' Abdominal Typhus ', ' Enteric Fever ', ' Typhoid ', ' Vaccines ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' pediatrician ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' antibody titering ', ' Antibody titer measurement ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' microchip ', ' Drops ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Scheme ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' Antibody Response ', ' HIV/TB ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' point-of-care diagnosis ', ' point-of-care detection ', ' biomarker signature ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,960557

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of this research project is to develop a single-cell pathogen diagnostic platform which integrates broad-range bacterial detection, species identification (ID) and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) in a streamlined test.","A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections",10078849,R01AI137272,"['Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Recombinant DNA ', ' Recombinant DNA Molecular Biology ', ' rDNA ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' EC 2.7.7.49 ', ' RNA Transcriptase ', ' RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase ', ' Reverse Transcriptase ', ' Revertase ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' rRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-rRNA ', ' RNA, Ribosomal, Precursors ', ' Science ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Infection Control ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' empowered ', ' melting ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Lysis ', ' Cytolysis ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Preparation ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' multi-drug resistant pathogen ', ' MDR organism ', ' MDR pathogen ', ' multi-drug resistant organism ', ' multidrug resistant organism ', ' multidrug resistant pathogen ', ' multiple drug resistant organism ', ' multiple drug resistant pathogen ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' imager ', ' classification algorithm ', ' acute care ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,720032
"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,10092221,R01MH117807,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' autism community ', ' ASD community ', ' autism spectrum disorder community ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,690443
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers.

"Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, pulmonary influenza infection occurs annually in 5-20% of the population with mortality in the range of 30,000 deaths. The recent 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrated the potential for higher infection rates, which were reported to be as high as 45% in certain age groups. The 2017-18 influenza season had the highest pediatric mortalities since the 2009 pandemic. Influenza infection is known to result in a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes in humans, although severe pneumonia is relatively rare. Despite this, severe disease often requires advanced supportive care in the young, including previously healthy children. Host factors involved in determining the outcome of influenza infection are unclear and children are known to be at higher risk of severe disease. First life exposure to influenza is also thought to dictate life-long immunity. Little is known about the effects of young age and gender on influenza responses and severity. This underscores the importance of understanding influenza pathogenesis in a pediatric population. Influenza pathogenesis is likely mediated in large part by exuberant inflammatory host responses in the lung. It is likely that predictive soluble inflammatory mediators are present in severe infection. Further, predictive biomarkers or mathematical models of influenza pneumonia severity would enhance clinical decision making and patient care. We propose that machine learning and mathematical modeling of host immune endpoints will define a molecular fingerprint of severe influenza pneumonia in juveniles. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characteristic molecular pathways related to influenza severity in juvenile animals, using outbred mice. We will utilize machine learning and new mathematical approaches for pathway and biomarker selection. Aim 2 will test mathematical models of influenza pathogenesis to elucidate new mechanisms that drive lung injury. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify novel biomarkers and mechanistic models of influenza pneumonia severity that can be applied to children. To accomplish this we will use a broad, exploratory, and unbiased approach. Candidate biomarkers and pathways would then be evaluated in future mechanistic and translational studies in mice and humans. NARRATIVE  Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. There is a critical clinical need for biomarkers and models that predict influenza pneumonia severity in children.

"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future

"Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum (CICADAS) PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness CICADAS (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum)—a clinician-assisted, closed-loop technology, mobile application for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Via ten mobile assessments CICADAS will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. These data will populate a machine learning algorithm that will tailor the delivery of ten neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises targeting sensory processing abnormalities. This individualized assessment and treatment approach is posited to induce adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, thus maximizing the impact and generalizability of psychological Evidence Based Treatments targeting social skills and relational strategies, including PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills). In particular, we posit that CICADAS-induced enhancement of processing and cognition will facilitate the application of PEERS skills in the environment of adolescents with ASD, thus improving their real- world functioning. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS; 3) an enhancer for PEERS. In Specific Aim 1, we will finalize development, ensuring that assessment data correctly populate the closed- loop algorithm and correctly guide the delivery of individualized NB-SCT. Next, we will involve three adolescents with ASD and two PEERS clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine CICADAS. Once decisions regarding app design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run to verify that CICADAS is detecting and improving sensory processing abnormalities and cognitive deficits. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that CICADAS is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm randomized crossover trial with 48 adolescents with ASD to document the acceptability of CICADAS and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support an efficacy trial in Phase II designed to establish medical claims. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition.

"Indiana University clinical Center for acute pancreatitis and diabetes clinical research network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pancreatogenic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes (T3cDM), is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP). Recent data suggest that T3cDM occurs more commonly than previously recognized and exhibits a spectrum of defects including features that overlap aspects of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. At present, the extent to which immune activation, β cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance occur following AP and the genetic, metabolic and imaging correlates of these phenotypes have not been characterized. To address these knowledge gaps, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pancreatitis and exocrine pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, diabetes genetics, and pancreatic imaging at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The IU Clinical Center will work with other members of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium to test the hypothesis that T3cDM encompasses a heterogeneous combination of metabolic and potentially immunologic phenotypes that are determined by distinct underlying pathophysiologies. We propose the following specific aims (SA) to meet the goals of this RFA. SA #1: To perform an observational study of robustly characterized adults with AP in order to address knowledge gaps in the natural history and incidence of autoantibody-positive diabetes (AAb+), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and diabetes occurring subsequent to AP. Enrolled participants will be longitudinally characterized with emphasis on identifying genetic, immunological, metabolic, and clinical risk factors for the development of AAb+, IGT/IFG, or T3cDM. We will use state-of-the-art immunologic phenotyping and measurements of pancreatic β cell function to define the physiologic basis for metabolic dysregulation in T3cDM after AP. In tandem, a biorepository will be developed for undertaking translational, mechanistic and biomarker investigations and ancillary studies. SA#2: The Imaging Morphology of Pancreas in Diabetic Patients following Acute Pancreatitis (IMMINENT) study aims to utilize novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients at risk for the development of post-AP T3cDM. This longitudinal study will evaluate pancreatic parenchymal morphologic and pathophysiologic changes following AP in AAb+, euglycemic, IGT and DM individuals. Imaging phenotypes will be correlated with the metabolic, genetic and immunological phenotypes established in SA#1. SA#3: To perform a nested case control study using state-of-the-art techniques to define the underlying pathophysiology of endocrine and exocrine function in the subgroup of AAb+ individuals with AP-associated metabolic dysfunction relative to those who remain normoglycemic. We will undertake detailed metabolic phenotyping to evaluate islet cell responses (i.e. β and alpha cell function) in parallel with arginine-augmented hyperglycemic clamp methodology to measure functional β cell mass, and endoscopic assessment to define the relationship between impaired exocrine and endocrine function in AAb+ T3cDM. We will utilize 25 individuals with AAb+ and IGT or T3cDM and compare findings to results in 25 normoglycemic individuals with negative autoantibodies from SA#1. PROJECT NARRATIVE While diabetes is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), a full understanding of the underlying etiology of this disorder is lacking. To address this gap in knowledge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team at Indiana University, with expertise in exocrine pancreas pathophysiology, diabetes, β cell biology, genetics, and pancreatic imaging. As part of the newly formed Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, members of the Indiana University Clinical Center will collaborate with other consortium members to undertake studies focused on the comprehensive clinical, epidemiological, biological and imaging characterization of diabetes occurring after AP.",Indiana University clinical Center for acute pancreatitis and diabetes

"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore, social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our 12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions (N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone; d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare, mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing, poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Our proposed prospective research, focusing on examining the effectiveness of both a telehealth platform and an innovative treatment approach for parents and primary caregivers as well as frontline healthcare providers who are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to provide support to these highly vulnerable groups based in the Bronx who normally encounter significant barriers to basic care. If successful, the study has the potential to offset several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. As such, the clinical implications of our proposed research are potentially profound.",A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx,10261854,R01MH126821,"['Age ', '

Since 2014, I have been Principal Investigator (PI) on six federally funded awards: 1) one newly funded 4-year R01 from NIDA; 2) one R56 from NIDA; 3) one two-year R01 from NIDA; 4) one 4-year R01 from NIDA; 5) my K24 from NIDA; and 6) one newly funded 4-year DARPA research award. In addition, I received a William J Fulbright Foreign Scholarship to Malaysia. As my K24 evolved, so has my research focus. My overall research objective is to devote sufficient time to investigate use of next generation (“NextGen”) technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine learning in substance abuse and HIV research. My first research project, Virya, uses “digital phenotyping” with invisible biosensing and machine learning, to identify acute pain exacerbations in HIV+ individuals on opioids, a population at risk for problematic opioid use. The second reseach project uses mobile technologies to diagnose Covid-19 infection in HIV+ persons who inhale cannabis, itself a high-impact topic. Finally, the R01-funded MyTPill project compares the NextGen technology of unobtrusive ingestible biosensors that provide vivid, indisputable measures of medication ingestion. NextGen research discoveries become commercial products, but this process of introducing new discoveries into the healthcare economy remains deeply unfamiliar—yet increasingly important— to academic clinician-scientists. The objective of my Career Development Activities, therefore, involves learning how to navigate regulatory processes, FDA approvals, valuations, venture capital, contracts and intellectual property rights. Because of the growing importance of commercialization of research findings to the health and sustainability of academic careers, my overall mentoring objective of this K24 is to develop researchers who not only have the skills to conduct rigorous NextGen mHealth studies, but also to extend the mass of NIH-funded mHealth research into the healthcare economy. My mentoring approach incorporates several components that contributed to the success of my initial K24: dedicated funding for mentee’s early investigations; outstanding institutional support; several sources of referral of high-quality mentees; and renowned co- mentors who will help me establish a pipeline of mentees that have risen to that “cutting edge” where successful academic careers begin. This proposed K24 renewal, with its focus on NextGen technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine learning, is highly relevant to NIH’s mission because the lessons learned from this substance abuse and HIV research are directly applicable to the care of patients with common, intractable, and expensive conditions. Project Narrative This project focuses on mentoring of junior clinician scientists who will be taken to that cutting edge where successful academic careers begin. Mentoring will be done through several funded and developmental projects that will teach not only how to conduct research but will also introduce mentees to the processes of commercialization of new discoveries.",Mentoring in Advanced mHealth Technologies and Machine Learning for HIV/Drug Abuse Research,10258162,K24DA037109,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect

"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate surveillance testing in the field and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making by soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and schistosomiasis control and prevention programs. This project will develop and test a mobile phone-based STH-schistosomiasis diagnostic system that employs machine learning to very accurately identify and count parasite eggs from microscopy images of stool samples.

"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes

"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10248492,K23HL153581,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Physicians ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sputum ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Funding ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' International ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' disease phenotype ', ' prospective ', ' Coupling ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Infrastructure ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,210600
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome

"Decoding tobacco-related oral cancer ecosystem by integrative approach PROJECT SUMMARY Known risk factors for oral cancers are tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There is a clear interaction between tobacco use and HPV infection. Smokers have a significantly higher rate of persistent oral HPV infection which is a significant risk factor to develop oral cancer. Patients with tobacco- related oral cancers have poor prognosis. Apart from the obvious damage tobacco causes to genomic DNA, cigarette smoke exposure also significantly impacts the immune system. Recently immunotherapy has become a promising therapeutic option in oral cancer. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is one of the clinically significant checkpoint molecules that have been shown to suppress T-cell function upon binding to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the two PD-1 inhibitors with the most efficacy and safety data in management of oral cancer. While the detrimental effects of continued tobacco use have been established over the years, the effects of tobacco use in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and immunotherapy efficacy in oral cancers are poorly investigated. In this proposal, we will comprehensively evaluate the tobacco-related effects on the oral cancer ecosystem through integrated multi-omics approaches, identify novel therapeutic agents leveraging the oral cancer-specific TIME, and develop an oral cancer specific web portal to advance the field in tobacco-related cancer research.

"Investigating orthography-phonology and orthography-semantics pathways with implications for compensatory mechanisms in reading disorder in the context of a randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract Decoding-based reading disorder (RD, also known as dyslexia), a neurodevelopmental disorder with difficulties in reading and spelling, affects approximately 3-10% of all children. Because RD leads to negative consequences beyond academic achievement such as poor mental health outcomes, identifying effective reading interventions is a high priority for researchers and educators. Currently, evidence-based multi-componential interventions that explicitly and systematically target phonics (PHON, focused on letter-sound matching) are considered most effective for remediating RD. However, up to 30% of RD children continue to struggle, warranting broader examination of interventions that goes beyond PHON. Emerging research suggests that morphology-based intervention (MORPH, focused on the understanding and identification of the structure of a word, such as word bases, prefixes, and affixes) may serve as an alternative and complementary strategy. This proposed project, leveraging a funded reading intervention program, will examine event-related potential (ERP)-based neural signals in relation to responsiveness to interventions (RTI) by drawing insights from a computational model of reading (i.e., the connectionist triangle model). Based on this model, we predict that PHON intervention primarily targets the orthography-phonology [O-P] pathway, and MORPH intervention primarily targets the orthography- semantics [O-S] pathway. We also predict that MORPH intervention promotes greater reading improvements for individuals who primarily rely on O-S (possibly compensatory) mechanisms to overcome their weakness in phonological processing. Specifically, this longitudinal project aims to address (1) whether children with RD who have enhanced O-S processes at baseline are more responsive to PHON and MORPH interventions, and whether such responsiveness will be greater if the approach emphasizes both O-S and O-P pathways as compared to the O-P pathway alone; (2) whether the MORPH intervention strengthens the representation of O- P and O-S pathways. We will examine ERP-based neural signals from a lexical task, collected 4 times over the course of 5-week intensive interventions (MORPH, PHON, Executive function [EF], and Math interventions). We will use machine learning and an individual difference approach to assess O-P and O-S neural signals and their trajectories over the course of intervention, and to understand the relationship between these neural signals and children’s RTI. This proposal will help us better understand factors that predict children’s RTI, and the mechanism of different reading interventions. This fellowship will provide crucial research and professional training opportunities to become an independent translational researcher. This includes gaining experience in designing and conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and methodological training in EEG/ERP including machine learning and multilevel mixed modeling analytical techniques. This proposal also addresses her goal of generating scientific knowledge that can help better identify and intervene children with RD. Project Narrative  The potential impact of the project is substantial, as the findings will help us understand the characteristics of children with dyslexia that link to responsiveness to different interventions. Additionally, the findings will give insights into why some children continue to struggle with reading after interventions. Our hope is that findings may generate information that can shape optimal instructional strategies for each child with dyslexia, whether targeting the weaknesses of children or promoting their relative strengths.",Investigating orthography-phonology and orthography-semantics pathways with implications for compensatory mechanisms in reading disorder in the context of a randomized control trial,10389790,F32HD106739,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Reading ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' sound ', ' Teaching Method ', ' instructional practice ', ' instructional strategy ', ' teaching methodology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Educational Models ', ' Instructional Models ', ' educational methods ', ' educational practices ', ' educational principles ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' spelling ', ' experience ', ' phonology ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Orthography ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Reading Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' lexical ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' reading comprehension ', ' cognitive process ', ' comprehension skill ', ' training opportunity ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' imaging properties ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F32,2021,65994
"Efficient and privacy-enhancing consent management for health informatics data sharing Project Abstract: To reduce costs and enhance health outcomes, it is of critical importance that patient data are systematically gathered, cleaned and analyzed, thereby allowing us to build more accurate, timely and reliable models for diagnosing, managing and treating diseases. One example application domain is asthma control and prediction. In USA alone, about 40 million people suffered from lifetime asthma (13% of the USA population) and 26 million people (8%) suffered from current asthma. Developing better predictive models for asthma attacks, can result in enhancing preventive strategies, improving patient outcomes, and significantly reducing healthcare costs due to reduced emergency care need. One of the key factors obstructing such models for health care management is the integration of patient data that are scattered across multiple organizations. This fundamental challenge is particularly acute for chronic diseases such as asthma where patients often receive care at multiple institutions within a region. Furthermore, single site studies may provide inaccurate picture due to data inaccuracies. For example, due to certain selection biases, number of patients from certain race group maybe underrepresented in one location. In addition, severity information of diseases may not be complete if all the emergency care visits are not recorded. Without proper record linkage and data duplication, many of the disease specific conditions may be over-represented. For instance, it is reported that after cross-institution deduplication, number of records related to diabetes reduced 24.0%, asthma reduced 28.0%, and myocardial infarction reduced 10.9%. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to merge records in a manner that mitigates duplication, as well as fragmentation, of an individual’s information. Although there have been efforts to implement health information exchanges to facilitate data integration and exchange, linking patient records across multiple health care organizations create significant security and privacy challenges. At the same time, as the usage of healthcare analytics and the data sharing increases, patient trust in the overall data analytics pipeline must be ensured by asking patients to make a “consent decision”. This consent decision concerns the sharing and accessing of the patient’s health data for treatment, payment, and health care operations purposes. As a result, our healthcare analytics research nowadays is at utmost need of a product that can manage patient consent while allowing secure and privacy-preserving linkage of health care data across multiple institutions. To address these challenges, we will develop a privacy-preserving solution that can 1) efficiently capture consent, use the captured consent information to gather patient data distributed across resources within a certain health organization efficiently and 2) link the data hosted by different users across disparate health organizations while protecting patient privacy and providing accountability. Although there exist some solutions for managing healthcare consent and privacy-preserving record linkage, they are not integrated. In addition, existing techniques either do not easily scale for large amounts of data and/or leak sensitive information during record linkage process. Finally, we are not aware of any existing tool that combines private-record linkage with private blockchains for providing accountability. Narrative: Linking patient records distributed across multiple healthcare organizations while maintaining patient privacy, informed consent and accountability is critical for building better machine learning and data analytics models and improving healthcare outcomes. This project will offer a first solution for privacy-preserving consent aware record linkage that leverages recent developments in hardware, blockchains and cloud computing. Moreover, the new tool will enable the key capabilities for auditing the entire workflow for accountability.",Efficient and privacy-enhancing consent management for health informatics data sharing,10385293,R43LM013960,"['healthcare model ', ' health care model ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' cohort ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' payment ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' health organization ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' distributed data ', ' patient privacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' encryption ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' health data ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' blockchain ', ' block chain ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Data Store ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Modernization ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Theft ', ' Stealing ', ' Time ', ' Accountability ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' ']",NLM,"DATA SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2021,236384
"Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence (REHAB-PAL) Project Summary/Abstract  Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder and cause of disability in children, with a prevalence of roughly half a million children in the United States. Nearly all children with CP undergo physical therapy to improve gait, strength, balance, or flexibility. This therapy depends on dosage far in excess of available clinical session time, making adherence to an at-home therapy regimen critical to success. As therapy may be difficult, repetitive, or just not fun, maintaining engagement, adherence, and exercise relevance and quality in pediatric rehabilitation patients are critical barriers to an effective at-home rehabilitative physical therapy regimen.  To promote engagement and adherence, a solution must be attractive and fun, build rapport with the patient, and promote focus within a session as well as longitudinal motivation. Active video games have proven to be an improvement over typical practice but leave room for innovation; recent research suggests a promising complementary approach based on an artificially intelligent, physically embodied social agent. By activating humans’ natural social responses, socially assistive robots have been shown to enhance engagement and adherence in related settings.  Charles River Analytics and our partners at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital propose a Phase I SBIR to prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of “Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence” (REHAB-PAL). REHAB-PAL is a socially assistive robot for children undergoing rehabilitative physical therapy that provides companionship and engagement during therapy. REHAB-PAL improves adherence to the home-care regimen by encouraging the prescribed therapeutic exercises with fun and supportive interaction. To rigorously isolate its effects, we will compare the robot to a behaviorally analogous screen-based virtual agent.  We will prototype and demonstrate REHAB-PAL’s feasibility via three Specific Aims: (1) Design and develop socially assistive application software for a commercially available small humanoid robot and a screen-based virtual agent. (2) Integrate with a visuo-motor integration task. (3) Evaluate clinical suitability of REHAB-PAL for gait and balance training in children with CP.  Ultimately, we aim to show that REHAB-PAL offers patients an engaging and encouraging companion throughout a potentially dreary treatment, while offering clinicians a superior tool to keep pediatric patients motivated and focused on their treatment and a valuable proxy to provide continuity, consistency and monitoring during home care. By enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic dosage outside the clinic, REHAB-PAL has the potential to extend and improve care, with less frequent clinic visits and improved adherence.

"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,10464139,K08MH115164,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Harnessing multimodal data to enhance machine learning of children’s vocalizations Project Summary This Administrative Supplement proposes implementation of a multimodal data pipeline to support machine learning of child language production in complex naturalistic environments. The Supplement builds on the parent R01 (DC018542) that gathers objective, longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL). Even with cochlear implantation, HL is a life-altering condition with high social costs. Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing (TH) peers in preschool classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how early vocal interaction contributes to the language development of children with HL and their TH peers. The parent R01 employs computational models of child location and orientation to indicate when children are in social contact with their peers and teachers. An additional strategy for pursuing the broad goals of the R01— identifying interactive contexts in which children produce phonemically complex vocalizations and interactive speech—is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can determine the contextual, individual, and interactive factors that predict children’s vocalizations and vocal interactions. However, the parent R01 does not propose machine learning, nor are data disseminated in a format designed to facilitate machine learning. To facilitate machine learning in the classroom, a rigorous diarization process is required to determine speaker identity, which is operationalized as the likelihood that each vocalization was spoken by a given child or teacher. We will integrate audio processing of each target child and teacher’s first-person audio recording with processing of their interactive partners’ recordings. The influence of partner recordings will be determined by their physical distance and orientation relative to the target. This will yield a weighted speaker identification score for each vocalization. For 25% of the sample, the algorithmic score will be compared to speaker identification provided by trained coders to quantify intersystem reliability. Processed datasets will include 7,160 hours of multimodal recordings of child and teacher movement in classrooms synchronized with continuously recorded, child- and teacher-specific (first-person) audio recordings. De-identified output data will characterize vocalizations with respect to algorithmically computed speaker identification probabilities, coder-identified speaker identity (25% of sample), phonemic complexity and audio characteristics (e.g., fundamental frequency), as well as the position and relative orientation of all individuals in the classroom, and child demographics (including characterizations of HL). Over the course of the supplement, output data, Python processing code, and metadata descriptions of the processing pipeline will be disseminated in dedicated distribution portals including Github, Kaggle, and the UCI repository. Recordings will be released to certified investigators via NIH-funded repositories such as Databrary and Homebank. Overview. The current Administrative Supplement proposes implementation of a multimodal data processing pipeline to produce data ready for machine learning (ML). The Supplement is a response to NOT-OD-21-094 which calls for sharing “data generated through NIH-funded research” in ML-ready form. Disseminated data will facilitate the ML detection of child vocalizations and the prediction of child vocalizations in a complex natural context. The Supplement builds on parent grant (R01DC018542), which gathers intensive longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL) in preschool classrooms. The proposed supplement pipeline will integrate multi-source, multimodal objective recordings to computationally identify when children are vocalizing, compare those results to trained coders, and release all data, code, and metadata to enhance machine learning of child speech. Parent R01 premise. The parent R01 uses objectively measured, longitudinal data to capture the vocal interactions of children with hearing loss (HL) in order to understand everyday factors that facilitate their language development. HL, including deafness, is associated with delays and difficulties in social and language development. Even with cochlear implantation (CI), HL is a life-altering condition with high social costs. Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing (TH) peers in preschool classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how day-to-day interactions contribute to the language development of these children. The R01 premise, supported by the team's ongoing research data, holds that vocal interactions with peers and teachers in inclusive classrooms positively influence the language development of both children with and without HL (Fasano et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). Parent R01 objective data collection. Temporally intensive, objective measurements of child and teacher movement in classrooms are synchronized with automated analysis of continuously recorded, child-specific audio recordings. First-person audio and radio frequency identification (RFID) of location and orientation occur twice a month. In the classroom, children are outfitted with specially-designed lightweight vests (and teachers are outfitted with fanny packs) containing two Ubisense RFID tags (left and right, to detect both location and orientation) and a LENA first person audio recorder when they arrive at preschool. Using multiple sensors (radio cells) linked by a timing cable, the RFID Ubisense system can track up to 40 participants 4 times per second to an accuracy of 15cm in classrooms of up to 8m * 8m * 2.5m dimensions (Woźniak et al., 2013). Sensors track active tags worn by children (and teachers) in XYZ space by means of triangulation (angle of arrival, AoA) and time differences in arrival (TDoA). As part of Supplement preprocessing, a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) based filter (Sabatini, 2006) will be applied to de-noise the raw child and teacher position and orientation data (Crassidis et al., 2007). R01 overall goal. The overall goal of both the R01 and the Supplement involves identifying contexts in which children produce vocalizations, particularly phonemically complex vocalizations. The premise is that children's vocalizations create opportunities for both direct feedback (producing and hearing one's vocalizations) as well as interactive feedback from peers and teachers (Fusaroli et al., 2019; Hirsh- Pasek et al., 2015; Ribot et al., 2018). In support of this premise, the team's ongoing research indicates that both the overall quantity (rate per minute) of children's vocalizations, and the phonemic complexity of those vocalizations (the mean number of unique speech sounds per vocalization) are associated with children's assessed receptive and expressive language abilities (Altman et al., 2020; Fasano et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). R01 approach. The parent R01 does not propose or utilize machine learning. Instead, the R01 tests a priori hypotheses to predict child vocalizations. Specifically, the parent R01 investigates whether exposure to peer and teacher vocalizations during periods of social contact longitudinally predicts higher levels of vocalizations to those partners. Exposure to more responsive partner vocalizations and more phonemically complex vocalizations is hypothesized to yield higher rates of more phonemically complex child vocalizations. Computational modeling of children's physical location and interpersonal orientation within classrooms indicate when children are in social contact with peers and teachers. Although social contact is computed from observed data in the parent R01, it is derived exclusively from physical proximity and orientation. The empirical relationship between social proximity, social orientation, and vocalization production and vocal interactions is not known. Supplement-enabled approach (machine learning). Machine learning is a complementary approach to the broader R01 goal of identifying factors that foster language production. Machine learning offers data-driven opportunities to discover both expected and unexpected associations that support child vocalizations and language development. Machine learning refers to algorithms that iteratively represent data in a more abstract form to identify patterns of interest. These algorithms frequently capitalize on nonlinear associations between large sets of predictor variables to learn patterns in real- world data (LeCun et al., 2015). Value of machine learning of Supplement data. The Supplement will pave the way for the application of supervised machine learning approaches to predict the conditions when children speak and the complexity of the speech they produce. Moreover, machine learning can be used to predict children's vocal interactions with both children and teachers, which appear to facilitate language development (Perry et al., 2018; Romeo et al., 2018; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Machine learning can discover temporal, contextual, and individual interactive factors predicting vocalizations and vocal interactions.  Temporal and dynamic factors. Temporal features of a child's vocalization stream are likely to  condition the likelihood of subsequent vocalizing; that is, children frequently generate successive  vocalizations in close temporal proximity to one another (Abney et al., 2017). Likewise, the velocity  of children's movement (and their relative velocity with respect to partners) are dynamic features that  may be associated with the likelihood of vocalizations. Machine learning allows for the integration of  such temporal and dynamic features into detection and prediction algorithms.  Contextual and group factors. Contextual factors include classroom activities (e.g., circle time and  free play) that are annotated as part of the parent R01. A potential machine learning goal is  identification of classroom activities from the movement and orientation of children and teachers in  the class (activity recognition). Classroom activities, in turn, may condition nonlinear associations  between predictors. When children are shoulder-to-shoulder (rather than face-to-face) they may be  likely to respond to one another's vocalizations, but only when their physical movement is diminished  such as when they are sitting next to one another during small group activities. Likewise, the parent  R01 is limited to analyzing group interactions as a series of dyadic interactions while machine  learning approaches can leverage nonlinear changes in vocalization propensity associated with  group size.  Individual factors. Children with hearing loss (HL) exhibit delayed and variable language  development, which is associated with functional outcomes (Geers et al., 2016; Koehlinger et al.,  2013; Spencer et al., 2003). Importantly, children with HL are responsive to enriched language  environments (Cruz et al., 2013). The parent R01 investigates whether hearing loss (HL vs TH) and  hearing age influence associations between speech in social contact and speech production using  planned contrasts in multivariate statistical models. By contrast, machine learning approaches have  the potential to identify both similarities and differences in the contextual features that support the  vocalizations of children with HL and typical hearing. Children with HL, for example, may benefit  disproportionately from vocalizations from partners who are directly in front of them. Supplement datasets. The Supplement will process two multimodal datasets (first-person audio and synchronized RFID position/orientation information) from a multiethnic sample of children with hearing loss (HL) and typical hearing (TH). The datasets involve multiple (monthly and bimonthly, respectively) multi-hour recordings totaling 7,160 hours. Preliminary Dataset: 716 multimodal recordings of 82 children (44 HL and 38 TH) and 16 teachers comprising 2,360 hours of data collected prior to and in the first months of the parent R01. Supplement Dataset. 960 multimodal recordings of 40 children (24 HL and 16 TH) and 8 teachers comprising 4,800 hours of data to be gathered during the Supplement period (10/1/21 - 9/30/22). Finally, to enhance impact, the pipeline will be utilized after the Supplement period over the remainder of the Parent R01 to include an additional 85 children (31 HL, 54 TH) and 12 teachers, producing an additional 3,840 multimodal recordings with a combined duration of 19,200 hours. The Supplement's sequential processing and release of multiple datasets will allow for tests of the generalizability of machine learning models. Supplement team expertise. The collaborative project team possesses ample expertise to carry out supplement activities. MPI Messinger has employed computer vision of facial movement (Martin et al., 2018; Messinger et al., 2009; Messinger et al., 2012), signal processing of vocalizations (Esposito et al., 2014), and automated tracking of children's classroom movement (Messinger et al., 2019) in over a dozen years of funded research. MPI Perry is a language development researcher who employs first- person audio recordings to study children's language development in children's classroom environments (Altman et al., 2020; Perry et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2018). Consultant Narayan is an expert on audio processing and multimodal data integration whose extensive research portfolio has generated a broad array of publications, tools, data, patents and system prototypes (Lahiri et al., 2020; Pal et al., 2021). Supplement approach. To facilitate machine learning in the classroom, a rigorous diarization process is required to determine speaker identity. Determining speaker identity in naturalistic environments remains a challenge, particularly when some or all speakers are children. We operationalize speaker identity as the likelihood that each vocalization was articulated by a given child or teacher. In the Parent R01, speaker identity is determined by LENA diarization of the target child's first person audio recording. In the Supplement, speaker identity is determined by diarization of the target child's first person audio recording in conjunction with diarization of the first person audio recording of the target child's partners (peers and teachers). The relative weight accorded to the diarizations of the target child's partners is determined by their distance from and orientation to the target child. The distance between the target child and their partners, as well as their relative orientation, is provided by synchronized RFID position and orientation information of all children and teachers in the classroom. Speaker identification based on interpersonal distance and orientation. We will integrate audio diarization of each target child recording with diarization of their respective interactive partners as determined by the physical distance and relative orientation of the target and partner. Children serve iteratively as targets and peers in data processing. To determine the weighting function of a partner we calculate their distance to the target and the target and partner interpersonal orientations. An exponential function decreases weight (𝑤) proportional to the square of the distance between the target child and partner (peer or teacher) and their interpersonal angular difference from face-to-face contact as follows:  𝑤ሺ𝑟, 𝜃ଵ, 𝜃ଶሻ ൌ 𝑒𝑥𝑝ሺെ𝑟ଶ/2𝜎௥ଶ െ 𝜃ଵଶ/2𝜎ఏଶ െ 𝜃ଶଶ/2𝜎ఏଶሻ , (1) where the radius 𝑟 ൌ ඥሺ𝑥ଵ െ 𝑥ଶሻଶ ൅ ሺ𝑦ଵ െ 𝑦ଶሻଶ represents the distance between pairs of individuals, and 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 are their respective orientations toward one another (interpersonal orientations). A distance of 1 meters and an interpersonal orientation of 15 degree are used as arbitrary scaling factors (σr = 2m and σθ =15o). Thus the weight (influence) of peer recordings rises as the distance between the peer and the target decreases, and as their orientation becomes more face-to-face (see Figure 1). This procedure yields weighted speaker identification likelihoods for each vocalization. Both likelihood scores and a winner-takes-all vocalizer will be reported continuously in time for each audio recording. Figure 1. Data processing pipeline. The figure illustrates proposed dataflow using an exemplar Target child, a peer (Peer1), and a teacher. Children serve as both targets and peers in data processing. Pairs of RFID sensors worn by each participant illustrate their relative distance and interpersonal orientation. First person LENA audio recordings of Target and Peer and diarization with the ALICE open-source DNN toolkit (overlapping speech is not shown). Note that Peer1 diarization of peer speech shortly before 54:56 increases the likelihood that the vocalization pertains to the Target. The continuous likelihood that a vocalization pertains to the target, a peer, or teacher is rendered (likelihoods are affected by a second peer who is not visualized). Expert rating of the Target recording—available for 25% of vocalizations—will be of particular value to ML researchers interested in child speech detection. Harnessing audio processing advances. The parent R01 uses LENA SP/Hub Version 3.4.0 proprietary software, which diarizes vocalizations with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on English input (Gilkerson & Richards, 2009; Xu et al., 2009). GMM and HMM are rarely employed in modern audio speech processing, however, having been supplanted by deep neural networks (DNNs) that recursively represent the raw audio signal at increasing levels of abstraction to identify speech and speakers (Pal et al., 2021). In the Supplement, audio recordings will be diarized using ALICE, an open-source, multi-language toolkit trained on multiple, first-person audio recording corpora from diverse linguistic and socioeconomic contexts (Räsänen et al., 2020). ALICE uses a series of DNNs (recurrent neural networks and a convolutional neural network) to identify and categorize (segment) speech as target child vocalizations, peer vocalizations, and adult vocalizations (Lavechin et al., 2020). In addition, we will characterize first person audio streams with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) in Python and estimate the phonemic complexity (consonant and vowel sounds) of identified vocalizations using CMUSphinx (Walker et al., 2004) to enhance the value of disseminated data for machine learning research. Additional machine learning applications. For machine learning researchers investigating speech diarization the release of annotated audio recordings will be a major resource. The proposed multimethod, multimodal estimation of speaker identity, together with source audio (and movement) files, will facilitate machine learning research focused on improving speech detection and speaker identification (diarization) algorithms. The DNN diarization provided by ALICE will serve as baseline levels of speech detection and speaker identification while the provision of human reliability coding (annotations) will serve as a reliability benchmark. Reliability coding. To benchmark intersystem reliability, 25% of recordings will be annotated by one of 15 undergraduate coders trained to reliability—and regularly assessed for drift—by the project Research Associate. Coders will be randomly assigned 25% of each participant's first person audio recordings, which will allow them to become familiar with that speaker's vocalizations. Using ELAN (ELAN, 2019), coders will identify vocalizations and designate the speaker as Target, Peer, or Teacher. The team has experience with reliability coding in ELAN and preliminary data suggest the reliability of coders with LENA diarization (e.g., Cohen's Kappa = .77). Reliability of both speech detection and speaker designation between ALICE and trained coders will be assessed via Kappa, Diarization Error Rate, and Jaccard Error Rate (Fiscus et al., 2006; Ryant et al., 2019). Diversity, privacy, and consent. The makeup and demographic balance of the proposed datasets can contribute to reducing algorithmic bias. Preliminary and initial data indicate that the child and the teacher sample will be ethnically (50% Hispanic and 50% not Hispanic) and racially (23% Black [Caribbean and African American], 74% White, and 3% Asian) diverse. The child sex distribution is approximately 58% male while teachers are 90% female. In addition, the team is highly sensitive to issues of confidentiality. De-identified databases will be made publicly available; however, audio recordings will be made available only to certified investigators on portals employing 'walled garden' procedures such as Databrary. All participating parents explicitly consent to these procedures. Dissemination. Although the parent R01 is not designed to disseminate data in a ML-ready format, this is a central goal of the Supplement. The Supplement pipeline for producing the ML-ready de-identified dataset will be developed in Python, and include a loader to facilitate feeding data to deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch and Tensorflow. De-identified data will characterize vocalizations with respect to onsets and offsets, algorithmically computed speaker identification probabilities (and, for 25% of recordings, human coded speaker identification), MFCCs (including fundamental frequency, and intensity), phonemic complexity, the position and relative orientation of all individuals in the classroom, classroom activity codes (e.g., free play), and child demographics (including characterizations of HL). Python code, de-identified data in .csv format, and metadata descriptions of the data and processing pipeline will be disseminated via repositories including Github.com, Kaggle.com, the UCI Repository (archive.ics.uci.edu), and the Open Science Framework (osf.io). Synchronized source audio recordings (.wav files) along with de-identified data and metadata will be disseminated via NIH/NSF-funded repositories including Databrary.org and Homebank (homebank.talkbank.org).

"Predicting epilepsy in cerebral malaria: working toward identifying biomarkers of epileptogenesis in children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over half a million children suffer from cerebral malaria annually, with up to 10-16% of this population developing epilepsy within two years. Thus, cerebral malaria contributes significantly to the global epilepsy burden. As in many acquired epilepsies, there remains an important gap in knowledge on how to identify which children after cerebral malaria infection will be at risk for epilepsy development. Identification of biomarkers heralding epilepsy risk would improve timely identification of who would most benefit from closer clinical monitoring- a critical consideration for improved allocation of the limited available resources in regions where this disease is most prevalent. Identification of the specific clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) metrics which confer risk of post- malaria epilepsy will also importantly help understand epilepsy development in this disease. Studying these processes in acquired epilepsies has proven difficult to date due to the varied nature of etiologies and timing of epilepsy development after brain insult. Cerebral malaria has potential to be a unique model for identification of epileptogenesis biomarkers, as it is a single disease state with a high rate of post-epilepsy development within a relatively short time frame. This proposal will address key gaps in knowledge regarding the utility of clinical and EEG metrics readily available in resource-limited settings for predictive ability to prognosticate epilepsy risk in children with cerebral malaria. The findings have the potential to lay the foundation for future research of targeted interventions directed toward reducing post-cerebral malaria epilepsy development. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award application aligns with two of the benchmarks set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and American Epilepsy Society, including Area II- understanding epileptogenesis, and Area III- identify biomarkers. This proposal is also designed to provide important opportunities for the training and career development of the candidate. Dr. Patel has experience in global neurology research and clinical neurophysiology; this award will allow her to gain further experience in clinical research methodology and specific training in computational analysis of EEG. These skills will lay a foundation for further study of this condition and potentially in anti-epileptogenesis trials of the post-cerebral malaria epilepsy model. Ultimately, this research proposal and the accompanying training will provide a strong foundation for a successful independent research career devoted to the understanding of epileptogenesis and reducing the risk of acquired epilepsies in children globally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral malaria continues to impact over half a million children annually, with 10-16% developing epilepsy within 2 years, and as such is a large contributor to the global epilepsy burden worldwide. This proposal will use cerebral malaria as model of acquired epilepsy, studying the ability of acute and recovery phase quantitative EEG measures in combination with clinical metrics in prediction of post- cerebral malaria epilepsy development. The findings of this study will inform the ability to appropriately allocate resources for children with cerebral malaria, lay the foundation for potential anti-epileptogenesis trials, and provide further understanding of acquired epilepsies as a whole for future study.",Predicting epilepsy in cerebral malaria: working toward identifying biomarkers of epileptogenesis in children,10302080,K23NS118051,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Asphyxia Neonatorum ', ' birth asphyxia ', ' neonatal asphyxia ', ' perinatal asphyxia ', ' post-natal asphyxia ', ' postnatal asphyxia ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Infection ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Cerebral Malaria ', ' Mentors ', ' Neurology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parasites ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Seizures ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' neurological dysfunction ', ' Neurologic Dysfunctions ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' Predictive Value ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' Antiepileptogenic ', ' Anti-epileptogenic ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' training opportunity ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' childhood epilepsy ', ' pediatric epilepsy ', ' acquired epilepsy ', ' ']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195955
"Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Infections from antibiotic resistant bacteria represent one of the biggest challenges facing modern medical care. Suboptimal antibiotic use is one of the major drivers for antibiotic resistance, however clinicians lack robust tools to help them make rational treatment decisions at the patient-level. The goal of this 3-year mentored clinical scientist research career development program is to apply state-of-the-art machine learning models to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prior to, and after antibiotic treatment. The candidate, Dr. Sanjat Kanjilal, has identified two important clinical problems where improved risk prediction for AMR could have a significant impact on quality of care. The first is the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients presenting with community-onset sepsis. To address this, the candidate will develop a set of machine learning prediction models trained on routinely collected data in the electronic health record to help clinicians identify which antibiotic(s) will effectively treat the patient's pathogen while being of the narrowest possible spectrum. The second problem is the inability to assess the risk of a patient developing an antibiotic resistant infection after being treated with an antibiotic. The candidate proposes to build a robust causal inference model using targeted maximum likelihood estimation combined with machine learning to estimate the impact of taking various commonly used outpatient antibiotics on the risk of developing a drug resistant infection in the 12 month period after treatment. The results of this work will form the basis of a precision medicine approach to antibiotic stewardship and treatment. The candidate is a practicing infectious diseases clinician and the Associate Medical Director of the clinical microbiology laboratory at the Brigham & Women's Hospital. He has prior experience in building machine learning algorithms that provide robust antimicrobial stewardship. His unique background combined with the rich supporting environment of the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, position him well for the transition to becoming an independently funded clinician- scientist working at the interface of infectious diseases and machine learning. He has assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team consisting of experts in sepsis epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, implementation science, machine learning and causal inference to help him achieve his goals and has identified a comprehensive training plan that provides him the skills necessary to become a leader in his field. His short term goal is to become an expert in the development of machine learning algorithms that improve decision making for antibiotic resistant infections. His medium term goal is to deploy these models at scale and evaluate their real-world utility with randomized trials. The candidate's long term goal is to use these algorithms and the infrastructure necessary to maintain them as the technologic basis, of a learning health system that provides personalized decision support at the provider and public health level. NARRATIVE Modern medicine is under threat from antibiotic resistant bacteria, which kill more than 35,000 people every year in the United States. This project will apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antibiotic resistance for patients presenting with sepsis as well as the risk someone will have a drug- resistant infection after they are treated with an antibiotic. The results of this research will lay the foundation for a data-driven approach to antibiotic treatment that optimizes the needs of the patient with the need to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens.",Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning,10301631,K08HS027841,[''],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2021,149505
"Serological markers of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum is the most common and deadly cause of malaria. An effective malaria vaccine has the potential to make a pivotal change in malaria control and eradication. For a vaccine to contribute significantly to malaria eradication, it must target the early, pre-erythrocytic part of the lifecycle to block both symptomatic disease and asymptomatic infection, which perpetuates transmission. Naturally acquired immunity to pre- erythrocytic infection is acquired with exposure but remains poorly understood and continues to impede vaccine efforts. DeAnna Friedman-Klabanoff, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, developed this career development award proposal to use novel high-throughput tools to define naturally acquired humoral immunity to diverse pre-erythrocytic epitopes associated with protection, which could lead to novel vaccine candidates. Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff’s long-term goal is to become an independent clinical and translational researcher dedicated to the development of a malaria vaccine, applying immunology and data science to inform and optimize vaccine development. To gain the skills necessary to achieve this goal, Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff proposes a career development plan that includes mentoring from Drs. Miriam Laufer, Shannon Takala Harrison, Michael Cummings, Andrea Berry, Kathleen Neuzil, and John Adams, leaders in the fields of international research design and leadership, molecular epidemiology, data science for analysis of large data sets, use of peptide microarrays to study malaria, vaccinology, and in vitro models of pre-erythrocytic immunity. This project will utilize samples and data from a cohort study of malaria in Malawi led by Dr. Laufer, the primary mentor for this proposal. Household members were followed monthly for detection of malaria infection and mosquitoes were collected from the houses to identify bloodmeal sources. Bloodmeal sources will be identified by matching the human DNA found in the mosquito bloodmeals to DNA from enrolled participants . Mosquito salivary glands will also be tested for P. falciparum infection to determine if the mosquitoes were infectious. Children will be defined as protected or infected based on whether they develop blood-stage infection during the month after an infectious bite. Aim 1 of this proposal will be to identify serologic responses associated with natural protection against P. falciparum infection after exposure to an infectious bite. Serum from the day of exposure will be probed on a custom-developed peptide microarray designed from diverse, field-derived sequences to characterize pre-exposure immunity to pre-erythrocytic antigens. Aim 2 of this proposal is to assess the functional role of antibodies targeting P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens of interest. B- and T- cell epitope prediction tools will be used to find predicted epitopes in pre-erythrocytic proteins and their variants, and in vitro liver models will be used to assess the functional role of antibodies to these epitopes to validate and down select the potential epitopes. The practical implications of this work will be to identify promising epitopes that are targets of protective immunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Plasmodium falciparum, the most common species of malaria, kills more children than any other pathogen, and the development of a highly effective vaccine has been challenging. Children acquire immunity to malaria with repeated exposure, but the mechanism is poorly understood. We will collect samples from children who are exposed to Plasmodium-infected mosquito bites and compare the immune responses among those who develop infection to those who do not to identify possible targets for vaccines to prevent malaria infection.",Serological markers of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection,10301258,K23AI155838,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anopheles Genus ',

"Vanderbilt Integrated Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics (VICE-MPRINT) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - OVERALL There is a rapidly expanding knowledge base enabling precision therapeutics for a number of human diseases, but there are significant unmet needs in evidence generation to support translation to the treatment of children and pregnant/post-partum women. The recent widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the linkage of these data to other large datasets represents an unprecedented opportunity for clinical research and discovery. The goals of this Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics are: to address key knowledge gaps and perform clinical research in pharmacogenomics and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; to leverage data science methodologies and develop novel tools that support maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics research; and to enhance training for maternal and pediatric precision therapeutics at the local, regional, and national levels. We bring to this effort a unique collection of investigators, institutional support, tools, and resources that enable a paradigm-shift from current norms of slow, incremental progress. Project 1 will: use a community engaged approach to illuminate knowledge of, attitudes about, and priorities for pharmacogenomics; validate pharmacogenomic associations for maternal and pediatric populations using the innovative and generalizable strategy of EHR phenotyping; and identify and quantify variants with unknown functional consequence in diverse individuals to inform future research efforts and reduce disparities. Project 2 will: develop and validate EHR-based algorithms to identify a cohort of opioid- exposed infants and their mothers (dyads) and create a novel linkage of these data to state-wide data; test the hypothesis that use of medications for opioid use disorder is associated with improved early outcomes; and test the hypothesis that opioid use disorder treatment is associated with improvements in the novel longitudinal outcome of dyadic stability. These projects are led by multidisciplinary teams that include Investigators in Pediatrics and Obstetrics, and who are nationally recognized leaders in their respective fields. Both Projects will be supported by a Scientific Core – the Phenotyping Support Core - which enhances each project with expert phenotyping, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and experience in generalizing and disseminating phenotyping approaches. An Administrative Core will provide logistical support for the Center, supervise training opportunities, and ensure scientific interchange within the CET and with the MPRINT Hub. This work will contribute to innovative approaches to precision therapeutics for mothers and children and will develop the educational infrastructure to support the training of physician-scientists to support further advances well into the future. NARRATIVE - OVERALL The goal of precision therapeutics is to give the right dose of the right drug to the right person at the right time, but rigorous data on precision therapeutics in children and pregnant women are lacking, and there is a shortage of adequately trained investigators in these areas. This Center of Excellence proposal leverages our institutional strengths in Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics to address knowledge gaps in pharmacogenomics and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome using innovative analyses of electronic health datasets.

"Autonomous AI to mitigate disparities for diabetic retinopathy screening in youth during and after COVID-19 Project Summary  COVID-19 has led to disruptions and delays in routine pediatric care. For children with diabetes who see their diabetes team every 3 months, this has been reduced or transitioned to telemedicine due to COVID- 19. However, those without technology and internet capabilities, namely low income and minority youth, are less likely to participate in telemedicine and may see their diabetes team less frequently during the pandemic. Screening for diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), is generally fulfilled by a separate visit to an eye-care professional (ECP), and is also less likely to occur during COVID-19.  Diabetic retinopathy affects 4-15% of youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in adults as early as age 20. Yearly screening for DR is recommended, but only 35-72% of youth undergo screening, with minority youth and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds less likely to undergo screening. Early detection of DR through screening prevents progression to vision loss. The current standard of care for pediatric DR screening is referral to an ECP for a dilated eye exam. Recently, the FDA approved the first autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) software that interprets retinal images taken with a non-mydriatic fundus camera, providing an immediate result for DR screening at the point of care (POC) for adults with diabetes. In a pilot study at our institution, we were the first to implement this technology in pediatrics, demonstrating safety, effectiveness and equity, and cost-savings to the patient. We also found that minority youth, those with lower household income and Medicaid insurance were less likely to undergo recommended screening, yet were more likely to have DR. This is likely to worsen due to the disparate effects of COVID-19.  We hypothesize that implementing POC autonomous AI in the diabetes care setting will increase DR screening rates in youth with diabetes, mitigate disparities in access to screening, and be cost-effective to the health care system now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. In this proposal, we will first determine (Aim1) in a randomized control trial at two clinic sites if autonomous AI increases screening compared to ECP, and if those who screen positive by AI are more likely to go for follow-up at the ECP. In the second phase of this proposal (Aim2) we will perform a prospective observational trial of AI screening to determine if AI mitigates disparities in screening, and improves the proportion of at-risk, minority and low income, youth who go for follow-up if their AI screen is positive. In Aim 3, we will use a decision model to determine if AI is cost-effective and cost-savings to the health care system. If AI is shown to increase screening rates while mitigating disparities in access to care, it has the potential to reshape screening methods now and in the future. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes for which children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recommended to obtain annual screening for diabetic retinopathy. However, adherence rates are suboptimal with only 50% of children obtaining the recommended screening, which is likely to worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for at-risk, minority and low-income, youth who have been disproportionately affected. In this proposal, we aim to implement a new and innovative technology in the diabetes care setting, using a non-mydriatic fundus camera with autonomous artificial intelligence to provide screening and results at the point of care as a means to improve screening rates, mitigate disparities in access to screening and determine cost-effectiveness to the health care system.",Autonomous AI to mitigate

"Living in the post-Zika world: Impact of interactions between dengue and Zika viruses on diagnostics, antibody dynamics, and correlates of disease risk SUMMARY Worldwide, over 3 billion people are at risk of infection and disease caused by dengue virus 1-4 (DENV1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV), both potentially severe flaviviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The devastating effects of endemic dengue across the tropics and subtropics are well documented. The recent Zika pandemic galvanized research as Zika swept across Latin America. Three years after the peak of the Zika pandemic, major dengue epidemics have started to re-occur; however, the future of flaviviral disease across areas with widespread ZIKV immunity is unknown. In this R01, we propose to develop new tools and address key knowledge gaps in flaviviral transmission and immunological interactions between DENV and ZIKV to understand how widespread ZIKV immunity impacts subsequent dengue disease and to inform evaluation of dengue and Zika clinical vaccine trials and post-licensure studies. Based on our serological, epidemiological, and clinical data to date, our overall hypothesis is that DENV1-4 and ZIKV are antigenically closely related and that immune interactions mutually affect transmission and disease severity. We will address this hypothesis with the ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS, 2004-present), a community-based prospective cohort study in Managua, Nicaragua, following ~4,000 children, now in its 17th year. Samples from the PDCS, as well as companion studies in Managua, provide documented infection and disease data, as well as banked serum samples for over a decade before the arrival of ZIKV. The proposed study extends the cohort, ensuring that we are able to fully document the interactions of these viruses from the pre- to post-Zika eras. In Aim 1, we will develop innovative serologic tools based on glycan-fusion-loop-masked envelope proteins and new algorithms to distinguish DENV and ZIKV infection histories, critical for vaccination and epidemiological studies of dengue and Zika. We will then test our hypothesis that pre-existing ZIKV immunity can enhance disease severity caused by DENV3 but protect against DENV1. In Aim 2, we will measure changes in anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV antibody-mediated immunity over time, estimate annual changes in protective and enhancing population immunity to each virus, collect entomological data, and use modeling approaches to evaluate popula- tion susceptibility to DENV and ZIKV infection and the potential for future epidemics by incorporating immunolo- gical and entomological data. In Aim 3, we will identify determinants of protective and disease-enhancing anti- body-mediated immunity of prior DENV infection on Zika and prior ZIKV infection on dengue disease and severity. With support of expert collaborators, we will use state-of-the-art tools (e.g., new monoclonal antibodies, innovative flavivirus antigens, and antibody Fc profiling) to analyze specific infection histories and uncover potential immune correlates. Overall, this program will define new vaccine companion diagnostic assays, the dynamics of the antibody response to DENV and ZIKV, and correlates of protection and pathogenesis for dengue and Zika, which should be useful for the development and evaluation of dengue and Zika vaccines. NARRATIVE Dengue and Zika are diseases of major importance worldwide, but surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and control are complicated by immunological cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika viruses (DENV and ZIKV), particularly in dengue-endemic Latin America after the explosive 2015-2016 Zika pandemic. It is critical for dengue and Zika vaccine evaluation and implementation, epidemic preparedness, and public health research to improve differential detection of prior infections by DENV and ZIKV and increase our understanding of how immunological cross-reactivity affects serological testing, seroprevalence estimation, viral transmission, and protection and/or enhancement of future flaviviral disease. Following upon our recent work showing that immunological asymmetries exist among the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV and that pre-existing immunity to ZIKV can enhance subsequent DENV2 infection and disease, this R01 will use new serological assays, diverse modeling approaches, and state-of-the-art methods for antibody analysis to study samples and data from the longest-running dengue/Zika cohort study and extend this unique Nicaraguan cohort into the next critical phase of flaviviral disease in the tropics and subtropics where infection and disease outcomes are modulated by widespread ZIKV immunity.","Living in the post-Zika world: Impact of interactions between dengue and Zika viruses on diagnostics, antibody dynamics, and correlates of disease risk",10297285,U01AI153416,"['Aedes ', '

"Sepsis Physiomarkers for Appropriate Risk Knowledge of monitored patients in the ICU (SPARK-ICU) Project Summary Critically ill patients admitted to the ICU who develop secondary infection and sepsis, can face up to a five-fold increase in the risk for death when compared to non-sepsis patients. The majority of patients who developed secondary infections are more critically ill at admission and therefore require significantly greater resources. Traditional machine learning algorithms for predicting sepsis has been largely focused and relied on the use of structured data from the electronic medical record (EMR), however the EMR was developed largely as a billing mechanism and an audit log for clinical workflow. Hence, much of the structure and availability of data are often time-delayed, prone to errors from manual entry, biases from various institutional, personal and training biases, and finally contain a significant amount of missing data. In this proposal, we seek to discover novel `physiomarkers' extracted from continuous physiological data streams, generated from non-human derived data sources, that predict the onset of sepsis in this critical population. Using such routinely collected data, along with common clinical indicators extracted from the EMR, we propose to generate robust machine learning algorithms that can be more generalized, reproducible and removed from the biases and pitfalls of manual data entry. We propose that such classes of models not only may alert clinicians to acute and critically ill patients at risk for developing sepsis in real-time, but also investigate intervention effectiveness, such as volume responsiveness and support the discovery of novel sub-types of sepsis. Secondly, much of the existing literature on predictive models for sepsis focus on hospitalized patients in the general ward, however, models that predict the onset of sepsis among patients who developed secondary infections after admission to the ICU is limited. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that markers discovered from continuous numeric data streams can inform earlier prediction of sepsis in children and adults. However, those analysis did not use high-fidelity data from the waveforms, which encapsulate rich characteristics of physiology. Therefore, by emphasizing the discovery of such novel markers and through the application of data-driven learning algorithms, we expect to develop algorithms and tools that improve our understanding of the changing physiologic dynamics of sepsis in critically ill patient. In this proposed program, we will integrate knowledge across a number of distinctive expertise that spans signal processing, mathematics, computer science and medicine to develop sophisticated tools that can analyze such data to reveal meaningful insight. In short, we will contribute significant knowledge about the role and utility of complex physiological interactions that are at present abundantly available in clinical practice but seldom used for clinical decision making. Project Narrative Critically ill patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at the risk of developing sepsis leading to death, each hour of delayed recognition or treatment can contribute to significantly increasing the likelihood of death. If this application is funded, we will explore sensor-generated continuous physiological data streams to extract ‘physiomarkers’ that predict the onset of sepsis, aid in informing intervention futility (volume responsiveness) and support the discovery of novel sepsis sub-types. By discovering and modeling the mechanisms by which such physiomarkers predict sepsis, we can proactively recognize specific high-risk patients, appropriate resources at the right time to avoid significant morbidity and mortality, and begin treatments that improve outcomes in this critically ill and vulnerable population.",Sepsis Physiomarkers for Appropriate Risk Knowledge of monitored patients in the ICU (SPARK-ICU),10295735,R01GM139967,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fluid Balance ', ' Fluid Homeostasis ', ' Fluid Therapy ', ' body fluid balance therapy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Organ Failure ', ' MOF syndrome ', ' Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ', ' multiorgan failure ', ' multiple organ system failure ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' General Ward ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Futility ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' secondary infection ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' day length ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' signal processing ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,554120
"The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome engineering Project Summary The human gut microbiome is associated with a range of diseases, and may positively or negatively affect the success of therapies. However, the causal directions between the human gut microbiome and host health are seldomly clear due to a lack of feasible controlled experiments in humans. High resolution, high frequency temporal data of paired microbiome and physiological measurement, and rich metadata of potential confounders, allow the application of causal inference frameworks. Such data can be mined for potential microbiome drivers of host health, especially if both the microbiome and host physiology are perturbed during the time courses. We have recently published a vast longitudinal microbiome set from cancer patients undergoing severe perturbation of their immune system. Concurrently, these patients experience dramatic shifts in their gut ecosystem. We here propose to unlock this data and build a discovery platform for microbiome causality, towards rational microbiome engineering. We will develop a new machine-learning technique that enables rapid exploration of our data through effective visualization and a web-based interface. We will develop a new method to identify gut microbial competitor species of common pathogens, which are systematically missed by existing approaches but are representing the most promising targets for microbiome engineering. Finally, we will elucidate the bidirectional interplay between human- targeted medications and the gut microbiome. For this, we will leverage our large data set of paired microbiome and host immune cell trajectories. This will validate recent in vitro results indicating that human-targeted medications may influence gut ecology using in situ data, and it will identify potential gut microbiome modulation of pharmacokinetics. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a platform for the discovery of causal health effects of the human gut microbiome. For this, it provides exploration tools and inference techniques that unlock the potential of a recently acquired, vast data set comprising >10,000 stool samples, >1.5 million medical records, and >400,000 blood measurements from cancer patients. This enables discovery of candidate microbes that affect pharmacokinetics of human-targeted drugs, and reveals natural competitor species to common pathogens, thus revealing targets for rational

"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed. One approach to developing these interventions is to target proteins from the host that function to enhance viral infection, rather than targeting the virus directly. By contributing to a better understanding of how specific host proteins contribute to viral replication, the proposed research will accelerate the development of host-directed antiviral therapies.",Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion,10286563,R21AI163985,"['mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Transfer RNA ', ' Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor ', ' tRNA ', ' transfer Ribonucleic acids ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Virion ', ' Virus Particle ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Terminator Codon ', ' Stop Codon ', ' Termination Codon ', ' Translation Stop Signal ', ' Amber ', ' Antiviral Therapy ', ' anti-viral therapy ', ' viral infectious disease treatment ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Viral ', ' respiratory virus ', ' stable cell line ', ' virus host interaction ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genome engineering ', ' airway epithelium ', ' combat ', ' screening ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' CRISPR library ', ' CRISPR-based library ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 library ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats library ', ' unnatural amino acids ', ' non-natural amino acids ', ' non-proteinogenic amino acids ', ' nonproteinogenic amino acids ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Epidemic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' ']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236250
"A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Iatrogenic Withdrawal in Critically-ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Iatrogenic withdrawal affects up to 57% of children who receive sedative and analgesic medications in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), contributing to delayed recovery, patient and parental distress and prolonged hospitalization in (an estimated) 70,000 children per year. Due to limitations in sample size and variable sets, studies on iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric ICUs have primarily focused on the association of single risk factors, screening tools, and treatment regimens, without attention to early identification of at-risk children. This proposal will leverage a national, electronic health record derived database of over 200,000 pediatric ICU patients to investigate the full spectrum of risk factors, patient profiles, and practice patterns associated with iatrogenic withdrawal from sedatives and analgesic medications that could identify children at risk prior to withdrawal symptoms or early in their treatment course. I will achieve this by first identifying risk factors, patient profiles and practice patterns associated with iatrogenic withdrawal using traditional biostatistical techniques. Second, I will use the identified risk factors in addition to time dependent variables, such as vital signs and laboratory values, to develop a dynamic model to predict risk of developing iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric ICU patients using novel supervised machine learning methodology. Third, I will externally validate the dynamic prediction model in a local dataset from my institution’s electronic health record to determine if the model can accurately predict those patients who develop clinically confirmed iatrogenic withdrawal. Successful completion of these aims will lead to the development of an analytical tool to identify iatrogenic withdrawal in children in ICUs using electronic-based resources which can be operationalized into clinical practice. The proposed studies are feasible because of 1) my strong and productive multi-disciplinary team of clinician and data science mentors who meet biweekly under the guidance of my mentorship team including Dr. Murray Pollack, a leader in the field of predictive modelling in pediatric critical care and Dr. Michael Bell, a national leader in neurocritical care, and 2) the recent availability of reliable, large, multi- institutional pediatric databases derived directly from the electronic health record (EHR). This K23 award proposal will also facilitate an integrated didactic and mentor-led experiential training program designed to develop and refine my knowledge and skills in big database research, predictive modelling, and morbidity associated with sedative and analgesic medication administration. The career development and research proposal will enable my long-term career goal, which is to become an independently funded clinical investigator focused on the prevention of healthcare-acquired morbidity through big data research and predictive analytics.

"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s

"Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as a new threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2- infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. 1 Project Narrative As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict

"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Dropout ', ' Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Coliform Bacilli ', ' Enteric Bacteria ', ' Enterobacteria ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Future ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mannosides ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Transcend ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' nucleobase ', ' microbial ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Invaded ', ' Shotgun Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' time use ', ' Uropathogenic E. coli ', ' UPEC ', ' Uropathogenic E coli ', ' Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' stem ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human microbiota ', ' human flora ', ' human microbial communities ', ' human microflora ', ' human-associated microbial communities ', ' human-associated microbiota ', ' acute infection ', ' microbiome therapeutics ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' de novo mutation ', ' de novo variant ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' recurrent infection ', ' infection recurrence ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500
"Reliable prediction of high-risk infants of autism with cortical microstructural biomarker Abstract  The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral assessments that cannot be confirmed until 2-3 years of age. ASD affects 1 in 59 children in the U.S., and infants from high-risk families have 20 times of risk to develop ASD compared to the general population. Current paradigm misses the precious time window for potential early intervention from birth to 2-3 years of age. Therefore, the focus in ASD research is shifting toward developing early biomarkers which can predict the risk of an infant developing future behavioral abnormalities, while the infant is still in pre- symptomatic stage. Imaging markers play major roles in understanding of both ASD and typical developing (TD) brains. Neural MRI at early infancy may improve the current paradigm for diagnosis for ASD in high-risk infants. Macrostructural measurements such as cortical thickness and surface area from conventional T1 weighted MRI (T1w) have been the primary measurements for characterizing the maturation of infant cortex. However, T1w MRI cannot reveal information about the complex microstructural changes inside the cortical mantle. Cortical microstructure, associated with the underlying cellular and molecular processes, plays a vital role in neuronal circuit formation and emergence of brain functions. We have recently developed a novel protocol to quantify the cortical microstructure using advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI), including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). These advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive imaging markers for the microstructural differentiation that characterizes the infant cortex maturation. We hypothesize that dMRI-based cortical microstructure measurements in early infancy could be potential biomarkers for early detection of ASD in high-risk infants. The goal of this study is to develop and test a novel protocol, using dMRI-based cortical microstructure feature, to reliably predict clinical score of infants at high risk for ASD and other brain disorders in general. We aim: 1) to develop a technique that incorporates dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge multi-kernel machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age; 2) to demonstrate the initial clinical utility of the technique in infants at high-risk for ASD. To accomplish these goals, we leverage a large cohort of infant study that consists 100 TD infants who longitudinally undergo multi- modal MRI scans at early infancy and neuropsychological testing at 2 years for developing the prediction techniques, and a high-risk ASD study that allows us to longitudinally image the infants during infancy for testing our developed techniques. Finally, it should be emphasized that, although the present project focuses on its clinical applications in infants at high risk for ASD, the method developed also has important utility in detecting behavioral abnormalities in high risk subjects for other brain disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, ADHD), at a time prior to the age of diagnosis. Thus, this technique is expected to have a broad clinical impact. Narrative Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive markers characterizing infant cortex maturation. The present application aims to develop a technique that incorporates these advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes and clinical scores. This technique is expected to have a range of clinical applications in detecting behavioral abnormality in subjects at high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, at a time prior to the age of

"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child

"Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes SUMMARY The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth <37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge “transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations. The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the cornerstone of nutrition policy in the U.S., impacting WIC and other Federal nutrition assistance programs, health insurance incentives, weight and lifestyle interventions, policies to change the food environment, and nutrition education programs at the national, regional, state and local levels. This project will inform the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines by using cutting-edge analytic approaches to identify diet patterns that promote healthy outcomes of pregnancy. Although the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial, we focus on dietary intake because it is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and has important implications for mother and child well beyond the childbearing years.",Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes,10232384,R01HD102313,"['Accounting ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Conceptions ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Economics ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Small for Gestational Age Infant ', ' small for gestational age ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Nulliparity ', ' Nulliparas ', ' Nulliparous ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Requirements ', ' nutrient requirement ', ' Oils ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Planned Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Policies ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' nutritional care ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant demise ', ' infantile death ', ' infant death ', ' American ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' diet control ', ' dietary control ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Component ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' child bearing ', ' bear children ', ' bearing children ', ' childbearing ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' pregnant ', ' evidence base ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' food environment ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' healthy pregnancy ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' health of the mother ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ', ' WIC ', ' WIC program ', ' Women, Infants and Children (WIC) ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,620565
"Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC Title: Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with and without NEC Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that frequently results in death (20- 50%) or severe systemic complications. Although NEC is a multifactorial disease, its precise etiology continues to be poorly understood. As such, there are still no effective prevention methods or treatments available. Given increased intestinal and systemic inflammation seen in NEC, it is likely that the dysregulation of the immune system contributes to its pathogenesis. In order to better understand NEC pathogenesis, it is essential to have a solid understanding of normal immune development that occurs over the first two months of age in premature infants. Our preliminary data obtained from fetuses, patients with NEC and control subjects, show that there is a drastic reduction of total and tissue resident memory T cells in the intestinal tissue and an increase in T cells in the periphery. Moreover, NEC is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in intestinal tissue, and a concomitant decrease in circulating monocytes. Recent work has begun to address how neonatal peripheral immunity develops. However, data on the peripheral immune development in premature infants over the first two months of life is sparse. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory proposal is to define normal immune development of premature infants over the first two months of life and characterize its dysregulation in patients with NEC. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that development of the peripheral immune system in preterm infants is different in the innate and adaptive immune compartments from that of term infants, and it is this difference that makes them susceptible to NEC. As the blood volume in premature infants is limited, we have developed a methodology to perform deep immunophenotyping on as little as 100 µliters of blood using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). This unique methodology will allow us to address the hypothesis, with the following aims: 1) Define the peripheral immune development of premature infants (<32 weeks) over the first two months of life. We will perform CyTOF on peripheral blood from 50 premature infants, with samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Deep characterization of the immune cell landscape and maps of the developmental trajectories of the major cell lineages in premature infants will be generated. 2) Identify peripheral immune cell abnormalities associated with the development of NEC. We will identify dysregulation of immune population trajectories specific to premature infants who develop NEC. This information will provide us with a model for the immune cell mechanism underlying susceptibility to NEC. This project would represent the first detailed deep examination of the development of the immune system in premature infants with and without NEC over the first two months, and will provide sufficient data for the development of a large-scale, in-depth study of the mechanism underlying the development of NEC. Project Narrative: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of premature birth that frequently results in significant mortality and morbidity the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the development of the immune system in premature infants would allow for improved methods to prevent and treat NEC.

"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes.

"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for

"Blocking CMV transmission through the human milk metabolome and microbiome Despite decades-long research and multiple trials, there is no licensed vaccine against Cytomegalovirus (CMV) yet, urging efforts to better understand its transmission dynamics. CMV is a frequent cause of tissue-invasive disease in infants and immunocompromised individuals, and transmission happens easily and through contact with various body fluids. Among transmission modes, CMV transmission via human milk (HM) is recognized to have the largest global impact on population prevalence. Factors determining CMV transmission remain largely unknown, including CMV interactions with HM microbiota and metabolites. In general, commensal microbiota can greatly impact sensitivity to viral infections while, metabolites, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), not only feed human microbiota but can also act as soluble decoy receptors, blocking the attachment of viral pathogens to epithelial cells. Additionally, short chain and medium chain fatty acids are products of microbial fermentation, known to influence immune responses, and microbiota can also produce antivirals through secondary metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to better define CMV transmission dynamics, considering different factors and timescales, and to systematically and quantitatively study the role and interactions of the HM metabolome and microbiome influencing CMV transmission from women to their infants. Our preliminary data readily shows that CMV seronegative and seropositive mothers have distinct HM microbiome and metabolome ecologies. In particular, we found clear differences distinguishing seropositive mothers that are non-shedding, shedding but not transmitting, and shedding and transmitting CMV. These results led to the central hypothesis, which is that certain combinations of HM microbiota and metabolites prevent CMV transmissions, and that these combinations vary among individual dyads, but follow traceable and reproducible patterns. We propose to test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Determine CMV transmission dynamics with high sample density and HM microbiome ecologies underlying CMV transmission versus non-transmission; (2) Identify and validate key metabolites involved in CMV transmission and non-transmission; and (3) Define causality and identify molecular mechanisms of CMV transmission inhibition assisted by mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by elucidating CMV-host interactions and CMV transmission dynamics in various time scales, validating factors blocking CMV transmission, and providing models and tools to help advance the arrival of clinical resource. These studies also have the potential to lay the groundwork for, and translate into, rational design of personalized HM and microbiome-metabolome interventions without replacing HM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed interdisciplinary research is relevant to public health because Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe illness in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission via human milk (HM) has been recognized to have the largest global impact on population prevalence and, therefore, a research program will be undertaken to study HM CMV transmission dynamics in different timescales, systematically and quantitatively understand the role and interactions of the HM metabolome and microbiome in CMV transmission from women to their infants, validate factors blocking CMV transmission, and evaluate the impact of CMV transmission to the establishment and development of infant gut microbiota. Our findings will deepen our understanding of CMV transmission dynamics, provide a framework for translation assisted by mathematical models and artificial intelligence, and will lay the foundation

"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia.

"Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of Americans, and also causes significant economic costs to the nation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms through which CVD develops is of paramount importance if we are to successfully identify those at risk for CVD, and intervene to ultimately prevent CVD-related death and economic impact. Psychological stress reactivity has long been appreciated as a risk factor for negative CVD- related outcomes, and recent work suggests that inflammatory reactivity to stress is a critical biological mechanism through which stress increases risk for CVD. However, there are significant gaps in our current knowledge regarding the neural predictors and molecular pathways through which stress leads to inflammation. These knowledge gaps are critical to fill if we are to develop a full mechanistic understanding of how stress leads to CVD risk, and may also shed light on future intervention targets. Thus, the present project will use cutting- edge computational methods to identify neural signatures of stress-related inflammatory reactivity, and will use pharmacological tools to block an important stress-signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) and examine its effects on neural and inflammatory reactivity to stress. Study 1 (N=100) will use fMRI to examine neural responses to a social evaluative stress task, with blood samples taken before and after the stressor assayed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and circulating inflammatory proteins. We will use innovative multivariate machine learning analytic techniques to identify the neural patterns that predict changes in inflammation, as well as network-based analytic tools from mathematics to examine how large-scale brain networks change configuration in response to stress in ways that are linked to inflammation. In Study 2 (N=120), we will conduct a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol to examine how blocking beta-adrenergic signaling impacts neural and inflammatory responses to the social evaluative stress task. Together, these two studies will allow us to establish the neural signatures of stress-induced increases in inflammation (Aim 1), determine the effects of beta-adrenergic signaling on neural responses to stress (Aim 2), and examine the neural mediators of beta-adrenergic related attenuations in stress-related inflammatory reactivity (Aim 3). In doing so, this project will ultimately help identify neural signatures of risk for stress-related inflammation, as well as novel targets for future intervention to ameliorate the impact of stress on the brain and body and reduce the health and economic burden of CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE What are the neural and molecular mechanisms through which psychological stress leads to an inflammatory response, thus increasing risk for cardiovascular disease? The present project will use neuroimaging and pharmacological tools to answer this question, exploring the neural activity patterns and brain network configuration in response to stress that is associated with increases in inflammation, as well as how experimentally blocking one important stress signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) shapes neural and inflammatory responses to stress. Ultimately, these studies will fill critical gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which stress may lead to cardiovascular disease risk, and help to identify novel targets for future interventions.",Neural and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Stress-Induced Inflammatory Responses,10185562,R01HL157422,"['Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Shapes ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' attenuation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' social genomics ', ' socio-genomics ', ' sociogenomics ', ' double-blind placebo controlled trial ', ' double-masked controlled trial ', ' health economics ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' Affective ', ' Network-based ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' neural patterning ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Adrenergic Agents ', ' Adrenergic Drugs ', ' Adrenergics ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' beta blocker ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Play ', ' Propranolol ', ' Propanolol ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' beta-adrenergic receptor ', ' β-adrenergic receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,621869
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,10101678,R01MH115046,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Measures ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Age-Months ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' case-based ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' screening ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' clinically actionable ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' connectome ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' symptomatology ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' translational impact ', ' early screening ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,743237
"Methods to Test the Role of Age-related Lifestyle and Vaginal Microenvironment Changes and the Prevention, Treatment, and Progression of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), a progressive, chronic condition related to estrogen decline that includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, reduced sexual desire, and other signs and symptoms. GSM symptoms are a costly public health concern and worsen if untreated. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced accumulation of vaginal glycogen and shifts in vaginal microbiota. These include low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of postmenopausal women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by lactic acid production and hypothesized anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned about side effects. While vaginal lubricants provide some relief, many are toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. Thus, new ways to treat and prevent GSM are needed. Because lactobacilli are often reduced in menopause, vaginal microbiota are plausible treatment targets; however, probiotics alone have not been proven effective. Also, age-related changes in vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles; but, the cross- talk between these molecular features and their role in GSM is unknown. We hypothesize that core vaginal micro-environment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that increases in menopause but may be modifiable by lifestyle factors. Prospective studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they affect GSM. To achieve this goal, we will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected from 812 women aged 35-60 years with clinical visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). We will quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors) and metabolites (GC/LC-MS) in cervicovaginal samples. A novelty of this proposed project is that we will develop, validate, and apply new statistical methods for complex longitudinal data that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and compositional microbiome data analyses. These methods will provide a rigorous framework to handle missing data and confounding that has been a major limitation in many microbiome studies. The ultimate public health impact is that findings from this project have potential to inform development of new therapy to prevent or treat GSM to promote women’s health. Our team has the expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for this systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause for some women, and we hypothesize that these changes may lead to worsening vulvovaginal symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how age-related changes in the vaginal microenvironment (bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles) impact genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. This study will inform molecular targets of intervention that that can lead to new therapies to promote healthy aging.","Methods to Test the Role of Age-related Lifestyle and Vaginal Microenvironment

"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diffusion ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Puberty ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 4 year old ', ' 4 years of age ', ' age 4 years ', ' four year old ', ' four years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' 12 years of age ', ' age 12 years ', ' twelve year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' 16 year old ', ' 16 years of age ', ' age 16 years ', ' sixteen year old ', ' sixteen years of age ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early adolescence ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' adolescent brain development ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' postnatal period ', ' post-natal period ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,10204721,R01MH091864,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' prepuberty ', ' Prepuberal state ', ' prepubertal ', ' Individual ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Orphanages ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' foster care ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' abuse neglect ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' brain behavior ', ' cognitive control ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Data Analytics ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,411713
"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a child’s tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a child’s tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published model’s prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a child’s genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First

"Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics Project Summary: Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success. Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors.

"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Americas ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Arizona ', ' Aspergillosis ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Boston ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' fungus ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Histoplasmosis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cellular Immunity ', ' Cell Mediated Immunology ', ' Cell-Mediated Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mycoses ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' fungal infection ', ' fungus infection ', ' Paracoccidioidomycosis ', ' South American Blastomycosis ', ' paracoccidioidal mycosis ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Sesquiterpenes ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Caring ', ' desert fever ', ' Desert rheumatism ', ' San Joaquin Valley fever ', ' Valley Fever ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Medical ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' laboratory facility ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' anti-fungal therapy ', ' fungal infectious disease treatment ', ' Antifungal Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' clinical predictors ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' Primary Infection ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' community acquired pneumonia ', ' community associated pneumonia ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671
"Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype Abstract  Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and differences have also been observed more subtly in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP; a cluster of subclinical features related to ASD, which are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Prosody is a central component of pragmatics, which includes aspects of speech and language that modulate and enhance meaning at grammatical, pragmatic, and affective levels including stress and intonation, which are conveyed by changes in fundamental frequency, intensity, and rate. Atypical prosody in ASD has been identified as the most prominent feature that immediately identifies an individual with ASD as “odd” compared to typically developing peers, causing significant obstacles to social interaction and integration1-3. More subtle differences in prosody have also been observed among parents of individuals with ASD, and may serve as a key marker of ASD genetic risk, measurable in affected and unaffected individuals. Because speech samples may be easily obtained, identification of key prosodic profiles in ASD and profiles reflecting genetic liability to ASD, could have widespread implication as a biomarker for detection of ASD risk, and as a tool for assessment and interventions focused on this clinically significant feature of ASD. Limitations in current work pose significant barriers to the objective and efficient characterization of prosody, where current methods typically rely on subjective perceptual ratings which, though clinically valid, are difficult to obtain and apply objectively in treatment contexts, and are unfeasible for application with large samples. Moreover, without extensive training, perceptual rating methods are not adequately sensitive for capturing important variation and heterogeneity in ASD prosodic profiles, or identifying the often quite subtle yet biologically meaningful prosodic differences that may be observed in clinically unaffected relatives. These factors together impose substantial barriers to reproducibility, limit scalability, and render prosodic characterization unfeasible for use by clinicians. This project attempts to address these challenges by applying sophisticated computational modeling of extensive existing speech and language samples collected through a larger companion project (R01DC010191, PI: Losh), to characterize prosodic profiles in ASD and in parents. In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate evidence of distinct prosodic profiles of individuals with ASD and parents, along with relationships to broader pragmatic language abilities and neural processing of speech sounds in ASD and parents, supporting the goals of this project to apply sophisticated computational tools to speech data obtained across multiple contexts in order to 1) identify prosodic profiles that characterize ASD and the BAP in parents, and 2) examine how prosodic profiles relate to broader clinical-behavioral phenotypes, and aggregate within families, potentially contributing phenotypic signatures of clinically and etiologically more homogeneous subgroups. Project Narrative Difficulty with the social use of language, including impairments in the rhythmic and intonational features of language used to convey intention and emotions that are essential for establishing connections with social partners, is a hallmark of ASD. Subtle differences in these language features have been observed among clinically unaffected relatives as well, and might serve as subclinical markers of genetic risk to ASD. This project aims to provide clinically and biologically meaningful measures of such language differences, using state-of-the- art computational modeling of social language characteristics in ASD, to inform clinical assessment, treatment, and biological studies of ASD.",Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype,10113580,R03DC018644,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Emotions ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stress ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' endophenotype ', ' brain behavior ', ' speech processing ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' language impairment ', ' symptomatology ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,74639
"Quantifying body shape in pediatric clinical research Project Summary/Abstract. Excess adiposity is associated with metabolic changes that significantly increase the risk of developing 13 types of cancer. It is estimated that up to 20% of cancer cases are caused by obesity and that obesity prevention can play a significant role in the reduction of cancer incidence. Among obese adolescents, the most rapid weight gain has been shown to occur between 2 and 6 years of age. Despite clear connections between these factors and obesity risk, the study of obesity in early childhood is limited by the lack of body composition technologies appropriate for this age range. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Keiki is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health derived from detailed body shape scans from high-speed and high depth resolution 3D cameras, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research and clinical practice. Our approach addresses technology issues that have hindered body composition research in this age range including participants' inability to hold still, follow directions, small body size, and rapid fluid shifts. To develop our body composition models, we will recruit 360 ethnically-diverse children from birth to 5 years stratified by sex and BMI-Z. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates of body composition suitably represent a 5-compartment (5C) body composition model for studies of adiposity and health in young children and are superior to that of simple anthropometry and demographics. Our specific aims and subaims are as follows: 1) identify the statistical shape descriptors from 3DO scans that best represent 5-compartment body composition in an ethnically-diverse pediatric population, 1(a) identify the relationships that best link 3DO shape descriptors of body subregions (arms, legs, trunk), and matching volumes and body composition measures, 1(b) calibrate automated 3DO anthropometry to clinically relevant girths and lengths, Exploratory) identify accessible combinations of 3DO and TBW that can be calibrated to criterion 5C measures of fat and hydration, 2) identify the factors that define the precision of accessible 3D optical body composition estimates to monitor change in body composition and metabolic health interventions, 3) contrast the association of body shape, 3DO, and 5C criterion body composition to pediatric health indicators including clinically relevant exposures (SES, nursing duration, birth method, nutrition) and development. The rationale for this study is that early life access to accurate body composition data will enable identification of factors that increase obesity, metabolic disease, and cancer risk, and provide a means to target interventions to those that would benefit. The expected outcome is that our findings would be immediately applicable to accessible gaming and imaging sensors found on modern computers. Project Narrative. The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of which young children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Quantifying body shape in pediatric clinical research,10299250,R01HD103885,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Size ', ' Body Water ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Failure to Thrive ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Plethysmography ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' sensor ', ' whole body imaging ', ' whole body scanning ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pediatrician ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Fluid Shifts ', ' Descriptor ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' Leg ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' International ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' 6 year old ', ' 6 years of age ', ' age 6 years ', ' six year old ', ' six years of age ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' obese adolescents ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obesity during adolescence ', ' obesity in adolescence ', ' obesity in adolescents ', ' youth adiposity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' recruit ', ' rapid weight gain ', ' fast weight gain ', ' sudden weight gain ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R01,2021,659305
"Situation Awareness to Improve Infant Sepsis Recognition in the Presence of Clinical Uncertainty PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis has higher mortality in infants than other pediatric age groups, is associated with severe long- term morbidities in 30-50% of survivors, and burdens healthcare resources with prolonged hospitalization and complex interventions. Rapid identification of sepsis and timely initiation of antimicrobial therapy are critical to improve infant outcomes. However, limitations to current diagnostic approaches include the heterogeneous, subtle clinical presentation of infants and limited accuracy of laboratory tests. There is therefore an urgent need for strategies to improve the early detection of sepsis in infants to improve outcomes. Our objective is to improve sepsis recognition by developing an infant sepsis early recognition system that combines patient data with predictive model outputs to deliver timely, precise and relevant information to clinicians and nurses. Our hypothesis is that the integration of a predictive model with clinical data displays that improve situation awareness will improve timely sepsis recognition and management. We will utilize the strong foundation of our preliminary work in predictive modeling and existing data from our neonatal sepsis registry to produce novel methods to identify infants at greatest risk for neonatal sepsis. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from the disciplines of data science, clinical informatics, neonatology, and sepsis/infectious disease research to provide expert consensus recommendations. At the conclusion of the proposed work, we will have developed methods that support the integration of clinical data and machine learning outputs into decision support tools suited to clinical workflows. We anticipate such systems that pair advanced prediction methods with user-centered design processes will have broad applicability to many conditions and populations. This work will form the foundation for a future clinical trial to evaluate its ability to identify infants at highest risk of sepsis and provide clinicians and nurses with the decision support needed to improve their health and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE The rapid diagnosis of bacterial sepsis and timely initiation of antibiotics is crucial for reducing neonatal mortality and improving morbidity. However, subtle clinical signs and inaccurate laboratory tests make rapid diagnosis especially difficult in infants. We will develop a novel infant sepsis early recognition system to improve clinician recognition by improving situation awareness, with a goal of improving infant sepsis outcomes in a future clinical trial.",Situation Awareness to Improve Infant Sepsis Recognition in the Presence of Clinical Uncertainty,10296851,R01LM013526,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Display ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Methodology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' Neonatology ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Discipline ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' high risk infant ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' neonatal sepsis ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Medical center ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' age group ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infectious Diseases / Laboratory ', ' Infectious Diseases Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' infant outcome ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' health information technology ', ' support tools ', ' education research ', ' Global Awareness ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' infant infection ', ' infected infant ', ' ']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,388194
"Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT TITLE Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term career goal is to establish a highly influential and independent research program and become a broad spectrum leader and innovator in computational psychiatry. I therefore propose the following training goals: 1) To gain formalized training in computational psychiatry methods and statistics, including deep learning and structural equation modeling, 2) to obtain a deeper understanding of the field of developmental psychopathology, and 3) to acquire training in developing and sustaining an independent investigator position with his own laboratory. To meet the first goal, I will meet regularly with University of California Davis (UCD) faculty co-mentors Ian Davidson and Emilio Ferrer, attend relevant UCD classes, and complete a Research Plan with the following Specific Aims: 1) Using deep learning from Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study data (demographic/clinical information, neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging data, and environmental metrics), predict child psychotic-like experience (PLE) distress scores the following year (i.e., baseline data predicting year one PQ-BC distress, year one data predicting year two distress, etc.), and 2) Using rules-based guidance from deep learning using explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, use sequential, structural equation modeling (SEM) of latent profiles (i.e., longitudinal trajectories, e.g., emerging, absent, remitting, persistent) to test hypotheses regarding the longitudinal mechanism(s) which may lead to persistent PLEs in the ABCD cohort. In Aim 1, XAI methods will be used identify the rules used by the deep learner to make decisions; in Aim 2, these rules will then be used to create latent constructs for modeling profiles of longitudinal trajectories. If r2>0.80 is consistently achieved for each iterative analysis in Aim 1, it suggests that ABCD instruments may predict PLE severity one year after measurement at a potentially clinically implementable level and help generate future hypotheses for personalized interventions aimed at reducing risk for persistent PLE distress. For Aim 2, insight will be gained with regard to how brain structure, brain function, neurocognitive ability, and environmental influences interact to influence the time course of PLE expression. To meet the second goal, I will receive mentoring including guided readings via monthly meetings with co-mentor Dr. Ellen Leibenluft, a world-renowned psychiatrist specializing in developmental research and Section Chief at the NIMH. I will also attend developmental classes, seminars, and workshops offered by UCD. To meet the third goal, I will attend weekly meetings with mentor Dr. Cameron Carter, from whom I will gain overarching career guidance. This will include learning how to create and oversee a laboratory, obtaining recommendations for society memberships, acquiring networking opportunities, securing grant sponsorships, and receiving RCR-related guidance. I will also attend mentoring and grantsmanship workshops offered by UCD, attend an off-campus workshop providing hands-on activities to provide exposure to fundamental management skills, complete a formalized UCD RCR plan, and gain mentoring experience by advising a research assistant and postdoc. PROJECT NARRATIVE Child psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are common disturbances of perception and ideation that occur in childhood and that (if they become persistent) may be risk factors for poor mental health in adolescence and beyond. As risk factors that predict persistent PLEs have not been reliably identified, the goal of this study is to use deep learning combined with explainable artificial intelligence to identify features from multimodal data in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study dataset that predict future levels of PLE distress, and then use these features to model PLE trajectories using structured equation modeling. The results of this study will help develop novel, personalized ways to prevent persistent PLEs from developing and ultimately improve mental health.",Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent

"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy ', ' Award ', ' Azathioprine ', ' Azothioprine ', ' Immuran ', ' Imuran ', ' Imurel ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hydroxychloroquine ', ' Hydroxychlorochin ', ' Oxychlorochin ', ' Oxychloroquine ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive drug ', ' Immunosuppressive treatment ', ' immune suppressive agent ', ' immune suppressor ', ' immunosuppressive substance ', ' immunosuppressor ', ' Infection ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maryland ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Methotrexate ', ' Methotrexate Methylaminopterin ', ' Methotrexatum ', ' Metotrexato ', ' Morbidity -

"The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Although cure rates for childhood cancer have increased over several decades, cancer remains the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Yet, there are no existing quality measures to define optimal end-of- life care (EOLC) for children with cancer. A lack of standards for EOLC contributes to high healthcare utilization for children with advanced, incurable cancer, as well as widely variable palliative care provision. For adults with cancer, high quality EOLC is defined at least in part by measures to reduce use of intensive healthcare resources, such as avoidance of hospital stays in the last weeks of life and prompt referral to hospice. In contrast, attributes of high quality EOLC for children with cancer have not been previously elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, the overall objectives of this proposal are to prioritize family-centered quality measures for EOLC and to pioneer complementary approaches to assess care quality for children with advanced cancer. Specific aims are to: (1) establish a priority list of EOLC quality measures, from the perspective of parents of children with cancer; (2) characterize EOLC process measures for children who died of cancer, using natural language processing in electronic health records; and (3) develop and pilot the “Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience” (PACE) questionnaire to prospectively appraise care quality for children with advanced cancer. Completion of these aims will lay the foundation for the first multi-center, multi- modal evaluation of end-of-life care quality in children with cancer. The long term goal of Dr. Ananth’s research program is to build a platform for systematically measuring, reporting, and incentivizing high quality EOLC in children with cancer, facilitating goal-concordant care delivery. Through the proposed research, Dr. Ananth seeks to advance the science of measuring EOLC quality in childhood cancer. Dr. Ananth is supported by an outstanding mentorship team and scientific advisory committee, with substantial expertise spanning patient- reported outcomes, artificial intelligence-based techniques for research, and pediatric palliative care investigation. Dr. Ananth will pursue formal training in patient-centered quality measurement, natural language processing, and questionnaire design and validation, concurrently building skills in leadership of a multi-center consortium. Collectively, the research in this proposal and career development plan will amply prepare her for an independent career focused on enhancing quality of care for children with advanced, incurable cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although most children with cancer are cured long-term, 10-15% of children will ultimately develop advanced, incurable illness, rendering cancer the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Currently, no measures exist to assess the quality of care children with cancer receive near the end of life. The proposed research will help develop family-centered measures of high quality end-of-life care and test novel methods of evaluating quality.",The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer,10190336,K08CA259222,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bereavement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Incentives ', ' Intubation ', ' Leadership ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Non-accidental ', ' Nonaccidental ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' evidence base ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,220150
"2/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well-baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6-10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check- ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12-24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early-detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state-level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program. Success of this large and clinically valid first-of-its-kind work will spark more such studies of this vital question, and through that, future pediatric best-practices guidelines for age of detection and treatment of ASD can be properly based on objective evidence and implemented nation-wide.",2/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD,10124437,R01MH121599,"['Academy ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arizona ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Boston ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' early screening ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' autism community ', ' ASD community ', ' autism spectrum disorder community ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,450569
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,10120705,K23GM132688,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Infection ', ' IL7 gene ', ' IL-7 ', ' IL-7 Gene ', ' IL7 ', ' IL7 Protein ', ' Interleukin 7 Precursor ', ' Interleukin 7 Precursor Gene ', ' Interleukin-7 ', ' Interleukin-7 Gene ', ' Lymphopoietin-1 ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an administrative supplement to our existing NIDA-funded grant entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755). Every 15 minutes in the United States, an infant is born exposed to opioids, many of which develop the difficult to treat drug withdrawal syndrome, Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of NOWS is highly subjective and includes “high pitched cry” simply based on the nurse’s judgement. The objective measurement of the acoustic characteristics of the cry in babies with NOWS is a pivotal component of the Specific Aims of the active award for this Administrative Supplement entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755): Aim 1: Determine neurobehavioral, cry, prenatal opioid and other substance exposure measured via maternal hair, and sociodemographic predictors of NOWS onset and severity. Aim 2: Evaluate the predictive validity of these clinical markers and test whether NOWS severity predicts neurodevelopment impairment at 6 and 18 months. We developed a computer-based cry analyzer that extracts the acoustic features of an infant’s cry. We used the cry analyzer to determine the acoustic characteristics of the cries of babies with NOWS and developed a NOWS cry “signature” that can identify which babies develop NOWS with a 91% accuracy rate. However, the cry technology that we developed is not usable at the bedside. The Specific Aim of this Administrative Supplement Is to develop a cloud-based system for the automated analysis of infant cry acoustical characteristics for the diagnosis of NOWS. The proposed software will enable us to have a fully automatic system, where a user records a baby cry in the newborn nursery using a phone or other connected device, and within a few seconds, receives the diagnostic result. This Administrative Supplement will provide the cloud-based software to change clinical practice by providing a more accurate and reliable diagnosis of NOWS which will affect the pharmacological treatment of NOWS including length of hospital stay and potentially improve the long-term outcome of these infants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid epidemic has resulted in an alarming increase in the number of newborn babies who suffer drug withdrawal (NOWS or Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome). We will develop a cloud-based software system for the accurate diagnosis of NOWS and improve the management, health and development of these babies.","Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome",10405202,R01DA049755,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Computers ', ' Crying ', ' Diagnosis ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Judgment ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Morphine ', ' Infumorph ', ' Kadian ', ' MS Contin ', ' MSir ', ' Morphia ', ' Oramorph ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Statex SR ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' newborn abstinence syndrome ', ' Noise ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Records ', ' Records ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Substance Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Training ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' software systems ', ' fetal opioid exposure ', ' fetal opiate exposures ', ' gestational opiate exposure ', ' gestational opioid exposure ', ' prenatal opiate exposure ', ' prenatal opioid exposure ', ' prenatally opiate exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' infant outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' cloud based ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' sociodemographic predictors ', ' socio-demographic predictors ', ' ']",NIDA,WOMEN AND INFANTS HOSPITAL-RHODE ISLAND,R01,2021,175593
"Population Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) causes frequent and severe infections in hospitalized patients. In addition, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant PA is increasing and is now between 15-30% in many areas. Thus, it is not surprising that the IDSA, WHO, and the CDC have each listed PA as serious public health priority in need of new therapeutic agents. An age-old question concerning PA is why some strains cause substantially more aggressive infections than others. The recent application of next generation sequencing platforms to this problem has begun to provide an explanation by demonstrating that PA genomes differ substantially from strain to strain. Approximately 10-15% of the genes in a typical PA strain are ""accessory,"" meaning that they are present in some strains but not others. Likewise, the ""core"" or conserved genome contains numerous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion-deletions (indels). Although a few of these accessory genes and core alleles have been characterized and shown to modulate virulence, they represent the ""tip of the iceberg."" A systematic examination of strain-to-strain differences in PA is likely to uncover a wealth of novel virulence-impacting genes and alleles. Identification of these would have several important consequences: (i) They would dramatically enhance our understanding of PA virulence and the mechanisms by which this bacterium causes severe disease; and (ii) they would allow one to predict the virulence of PA strains based on the complement of accessory and core virulence genes/alleles that were present in their genomes.  We hypothesize that application of comparative genomic approaches to large numbers of PA isolates will identify novel virulence genes/alleles and allow the generation of machine learning models to predict the virulence of PA isolates based on their genomes. We will perform the following specific aims to test these hypotheses: (1) Use machine learning models to predict the virulence of PA isolates based upon their genomic content. (2) Identify accessory genes and core genome SNVs/indels that play a causal role in virulence. (3) Develop a genome-based model that predicts clinical outcomes in patients with PA bloodstream infections. The impact of this proposal is twofold. First, it will lay the foundation for future models that provide valuable prognostic information to clinicians treating PA-infected patients. Second, it will identify new PA virulence factors that mediate novel pathogenic mechanisms of infection. The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes frequent and difficult to treat infections. Strains of P. aeruginosa differ markedly in the severity of disease that they cause. We propose to use a comparative genomic approach to understand the bases for these differences.",Population Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence,10367782,R01AI118257,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lethal Dose 50 ', ' LD-50 ', ' LD50 ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Moths ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Waxes ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' public health priorities ', ' comparative genomics ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' sequencing platform ', ' gene product ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ', ' P. aeruginosa infection ', ' infected with P. aeruginosa ', ' infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,549727
"Identification of Precision Sepsis Subphenotypes Using Vital Sign Trajectories Project Abstract The scientific goal of this K23 is to apply cutting-edge data science approaches to identify novel subphenotypes within the heterogeneous sepsis syndrome. This K23 application proposes a 5-year training program to propel Dr. Sivasubramanium Bhavani towards his career as an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Bhavani’s career goal is to be an expert in developing computer-aided diagnostic tools to map the extensive clinical and biological data in the electronic health record (EHR) to personalized treatment plans for critically ill patients. Dr. Bhavani will accomplish this career goal by completing 3 short-term goals: 1) Gain expertise in unsupervised machine learning, 2) Gain expertise in deep learning neural networks, and 3) Gain expertise in clinical informatics principles for model application to real-world data. Dr. Bhavani has outlined an integrated program of didactics, seminars, conferences, and consistent communication with expert mentors to provide the necessary career development. Dr. Bhavani’s mentors are Dr. Craig Coopersmith, a past president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine with a long career of NIH-funded sepsis research, and Dr. May Wang, a renowned expert in machine learning. In addition, Dr. Bhavani’s advisors are Drs. John Hanfelt, Annette Esper, Matthew Semler and Matthew Churpek, with collective expertise in longitudinal clustering, sepsis biomarkers, and bioinformatics. With the support of the K23, Dr. Bhavani will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches to sepsis. Sepsis is a severe and heterogeneous syndrome characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that results in over 270,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. Decades of clinical trials have failed to identify therapies that consistently benefit patients with sepsis. The one-size-fits-all treatment approach has not worked, and there is a need to identify sepsis subphenotypes that may have different responses to treatment. To date, most studies have identified sepsis subphenotypes using static measurements of labs and vital signs. However, sepsis is a dynamic process with biological and physiological responses that evolve over minutes to hours. The objective of this proposal is to identify novel sepsis subphenotypes using dynamic data, specifically longitudinal vital signs. In Aim 1, Dr. Bhavani will apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to longitudinal vital signs to develop and validate novel vitals trajectory subphenotypes. In Aim 2, Dr. Bhavani will investigate the immune signatures of these subphenotypes. In Aim 3, Dr. Bhavani will study the responses of the subphenotypes to one of the most common interventions in sepsis – intravenous fluids. Identification of subphenotypes with responses to different fluids could shift sepsis management from a one-size-fits-all approach to a precision medicine approach – the ultimate objective of sepsis subphenotypes. Through the training in this K23, Dr. Bhavani will be prepared for R01-level work in a) refining subphenotypes by combining dynamic clinical and immunological data and b) studying the responses of subphenotypes to additional treatments by using data from other RCTs. Project Narrative Sepsis is a severe life-threatening response to infection that results in over 270,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. The one-size-fits-all approach to treating sepsis has not worked, and thus it is essential to identify distinct sepsis subgroups that may have differential responses to treatments. This proposal applies cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to bedside vital signs (e.g., temperature, heart rate, etc.) to identify sepsis subgroups with differential responses to treatments, thus opening the doors for the precision medicine approach to sepsis.",Identification of Precision Sepsis Subphenotypes Using Vital Sign Trajectories,10350208,K23GM144867,"['Algorithms ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Societies ', ' Syndrome ', ' Temperature ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' crystalloid ', ' cytokine ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Sepsis Syndrome ', ' Funding ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Normal saline ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Intravenous Fluid ', ' IV Fluid ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' comparative ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,177902
"Automated Dental Fracture Detection using High Resolution CBCT and Advanced Image Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Epidemiological studies indicate that cracked teeth are the third most common cause of tooth loss in industrialized countries. Histological studies demonstrate that all cracks are colonized by bacteria, which have  the potential to cause intensely painful pulpal and periapical infections. The early detection of cracks (incomplete fractures) followed by appropriate interventions to prevent crack propagation are effective strategies to prevent  infections and avert tooth loss. Current tools used to diagnose cracks are inadequate and there is an imperative need to develop an objective and reliable method to detect cracks. During our Phase I project, we developed  and tested a novel algorithm for crack detection on extracted human teeth. Using machine learning and imaging  features extracted from three-dimensional (3D) wavelets, we demonstrated enhanced crack detection hr-CBCT. We now propose to further refine this technology and to validate it clinically. Our hypothesis is that our method  increases the predictive validity of hr-CBCT in detecting cracks. This development will happen with close clinical  guidance. Also, we will collaborate with CBCT hardware vendors to increase the impact of our commercialization plan. This proposal addresses the need for quantitative, reproducible, and evidence-based ways to detect cracks in teeth, that can potentially lead to improved tooth loss prevention.

"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Frustration ', ' Illinois ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' informal care ', ' informal support ', ' dementia care ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' stress reduction ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' feasibility testing ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,183988
"The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) encompasses a spectrum ranging from aggressive autoimmunity toward islet β cells to defects in β-cell function that arise from inflammation. A perspective that has been gaining traction in recent years posits that intracellular signaling pathways arising from the β cell response to inflammation can lead to the production of aberrant proteins that serve as neoantigens that initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity. This perspective has prompted our Team to identify and intervene in intracellular signaling pathways that affect β-cell resilience as T1D progresses from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stages. This proposal takes a multidisciplinary Team Science approach that is responsive to RFA-DK-19-024 to define and intervene in early T1D disease processes affecting human islets. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals are transduced intracellularly to activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an effort to redirect energy expenditure to mitigate the prevailing stress. The translationally inhibited mRNAs and their associated proteins are sequestered into intracellular stress granules (SGs), the formations of which are thought to divert cellular signaling toward an emergency response. Our preliminary data suggest that the ISR is activated in islets during early T1D, and that the pathway linking membrane-derived lipids to the production of proinflammatory lipid intermediates may trigger the ISR and the formation of SGs. We hypothesize that the activation of the ISR and formation of SGs is an early cellular response initiating β cell stress in T1D that determines cell survival and can be monitored in pre- and early T1D individuals with minimal invasiveness. Our collaborative Team will test this hypothesis through the following aims:  Aim 1: Define the mechanisms of stress granule formation and their fate upon activation of the integrated stress response in human islets.  Aim 2: Determine the molecular events linking lipid metabolism, activation of the ISR, and stress granule formation in human islets.  Aim 3: Identify protein, RNA, and lipid cargo in EVs as putative biomarkers of the human islet integrated stress response and T1D risk.  This application leverages the expertise of 6 Multi-PIs in β-cell biology, lipid and eicosanoid biology, functional genomics, proteomics, computational modeling, and clinical islet studies. The impact of this project will be to deliver new knowledge on an unstudied stress pathway in human islets and to identify and validate biomarker panels that reflect this stress state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that results from dysfunction and death of islet β cells. The identification and characterization of new pathways promoting stress in β cells would allow for the institution of defined therapies that protect β cells and their function.

"Immune profiling to stratify Clostridioides difficile infection outcomes Candidate: Dr. Gregory Madden is an Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of Virginia with experience in research regarding the diagnosis, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection. Career Development Plan and Goals: The proposed K23 Mentored Career Development Award will uniquely establish Dr. Madden as a translational researcher with experience in host-pathogen interactions and advanced modeling techniques. Training activities for the award include graduate-level coursework in clinical trial design and statistical modeling, culminating with a Master’s Degree of Science in Clinical Research. Research Plan: Clostridioides difficile is the leading healthcare-associated pathogen in the US. Evidence suggests that the host innate immune system (particularly Type 2, or eosinophil-mediated immunity), fecal C. difficile burden, and Binary toxin play important roles in C. difficile infection. However, no model to predict outcomes of C. difficile infection takes these factors into account. Data from our lab show that eosinopenia, specific biomarkers of pathogenic immunity (i.e., Soluble ST2 Receptor, IL-6), fecal organism burden, and the presence of fecal Binary Toxin are associated with increased C. difficile mortality. Dr. Madden, proposes to: 1) Construct a clinical-immunologic database of C. difficile patients to develop a robust biomarker-based model for outcomes of C. difficile infection and 2) Prospectively validate this model alongside the leading clinical models. Successful completion of the proposed research will create a validated immune profile for C. difficile infection outcomes that reflects our latest understanding of pathogenesis. In addition, we will identify a much-needed optimal approach for researchers and clinicians to stratify life-threatening C. difficile infection at the time of diagnosis. Mentors: Dr. Madden’s mentor is Dr. William A. Petri, MD, PhD, a leading researcher in the field of host defense against C. difficile. Internal advisors and collaborators have diverse expertise in hospital epidemiology (Dr. Costi Sifri, accomplished practicing hospital epidemiologist with a background studying molecular pathogenesis), immunology (Dr. Melanie Rutkowsi, PhD, biostatistics/machine learning (Jennie Ma, PhD), clinical trial design (Dr. James A. Platts-Mills, MD), and molecular diagnostics (Eric R. Houpt, MD). Environment: The University of Virginia is world-renowned for its work in enteric diseases and is one of the first institutions to establish a School dedicated to Data Science. The University of Virginia Data Science Institute, School of Public Health Sciences, Office of Hospital Epidemiology, and the Petri Lab will provide the resources as well as the diverse and stimulating environment for this Candidate to flourish as an independent investigator in this cutting-edge field. C. difficile is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infection, yet no single test or validated model is capable of reliably telling which patients are at risk of dying from the infection. New research suggests that a patient's immune system, and possibly other factors such as Binary Toxin, may be the key to understanding how they will respond to C. difficile. This work will combine known risk factors with new markers from the blood and stool into an integrated scoring system that predicts which patients will develop severe or life-threatening C. difficile

"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10228732,R01DK114945,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Posture ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Metabolic ', ' Body fat ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Population Group ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' older women ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,607600
"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 is the historical case that offers the greatest opportunity for drawing lessons for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Expanding on a new paradigm for MRI in pediatric congenital heart disease Project Summary Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common defect affecting approximately 1% of live births. Initially developed and optimized for adults, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is increasingly used in pediatric CHD patients to complement echocardiography and invasive angiography for anatomical and functional evaluation of the heart and blood vessels. For children, the non-invasiveness, unrestricted field of view, and absence of ionizing radiation make MRI an attractive imaging modality because many will need sequential imaging and long-term follow-up evaluations. However, current CMR for very young children requires general anesthesia and invasive intubation for acquisition of images that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. In the past 5 years, we pioneered ferumoxytol-enhanced CMR techniques that provide unprecedented image quality and diagnostic value; this technique has changed how CMR for pediatric CHD is clinically performed at our center. Our diagnostic application of ferumoxytol obviates any concerns about gadolinium accumulation in biologic tissues, In this renewal R01, we aim to develop next-generation CMR that can be performed without invasive intubation, and potentially with reduced anesthesia/sedation exposure. We further propose to build upon our improved CMR framework to develop advanced anatomical and hemodynamic modeling techniques for complex CHD. Together, these tools provide a CMR image-based strategy to help inform the patient's surgical plan and to ultimately predict surgical outcome. We will expand our multi-center collaborations to pool data and enable larger scale studies. Completion of the project will result in clinical deployment of new MRI pulse sequences, image acquisition and reconstruction strategies, and experimental and computational modeling methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Current Cardiac MRI (CMR) is limited in many aspects, which prevent CMR from achieving its full potential. The current proposal builds on our recent success in developing a new paradigm of CMR for pediatric congenital heart disease, which has changed how CMR is practiced in pediatric congenital heart disease. We propose accelerated imaging techniques and patient surgical outcome prediction tools to boost the value of CMR in managing children with congenital heart disease.",Expanding on a new paradigm for

"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10265540,R01ES031411,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' VIT C ', ' Vitamin C ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Pesticides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Uruguay ', ' Vitamins ', ' Work ', ' Arylesterase ', ' PON1 ', ' Paraoxonase 1 ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Tocopherols ', ' All-Trans-Retinol ', ' Anti-Infective vitamin ', ' Antixerophthalmic vitamin ', ' Axerophthol ', ' Axerophtholum ', ' Biosterol ', ' Lard-Factor ', ' Oleovitamin A ', ' Ophthalamin ', ' Vitamin A Alcohol ', ' retinol ', ' aryldialkylphosphatase ', ' Aryl-dialkyl Phosphatase ', ' Arylalkylphosphatase ', ' Aryltriphosphatase ', ' Aryltriphosphate dialkylphosphohydrolase ', ' Esterase B1 ', ' Esterase E4 ', ' Homocysteine Thiolactone Hydrolase ', ' OPA Anhydrase ', ' OPH Enzyme ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Anhydrase ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Anhydrolase ', ' Organophosphorus Acid Hydrolase ', ' Organophosphorus Hydrolase ', ' Paraoxon esterase ', ' Paraoxonase ', ' Pirimiphos-methyloxon esterase ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' experience ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' oxidative DNA damage ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' environmental chemical ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early adolescence ', ' cognitive performance ', ' antioxidant enzyme ', ' anti-oxidant enzyme ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Child Health ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,543551
"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease

"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) place significant clinical and economic burden on patients, their care-givers, and healthcare systems.

"The Ohio State University Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreas Cancer (CPDPC) Clinical Center ABSTRACT The mechanistic underpinnings of diseases involving the exocrine pancreas are poorly understood. Chronic pancreatitis is often accompanied by inflammation of the pancreas, irreversible fibrosis, and destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma resulting in abdominal pain, malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatogenic diabetes, and, in some cases, pancreas cancer. We have developed a network of adult and pediatric investigators to form The Ohio State University Clinical Center (OSU CC). In a multidisciplinary collaboration with other clinical centers in the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CPDPC-CCs) (U01), the OSU CC has helped develop four (4) major observational studies during the initial funding cycle to address research gaps in our understanding of diseases of the exocrine pancreas.

"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM. This project proposes the development, clinical deployment, and commercialization of a fully automated malarial retinopathy detection system consisting of a low-cost retinal camera and automatic malarial retinopathy detection software.",Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria,10253474,SB1AI162452,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Kenya ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Cerebral Malaria ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parasites ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Rwanda ', ' Ruanda ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Validation ', ' Software Verification ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Traction ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Businesses ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Specialist ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Letters ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Consult ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' research study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' portability ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' verification and validation ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' screening ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' physical symptom ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Rapid diagnostics ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIAID,VISIONQUEST BIOMEDICAL INC,SB1,2021,933793
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10252921,R44GM139529,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Fees ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' cost ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' encryption ', ' commercialization ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' health information technology ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' data hosting ', ' support tools ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' data de-identification ', ' data deidentification ', ' de-identified data ', ' deidentified data ', ' ']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2021,924787
"Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI)-ARFID Division: Sensory and Somatic Exposure for Children with Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a newly articulated eating disorder in the DSM-5 in which individuals are not able to consume an adequate quantity or variety of food to sustain healthy growth and de- velopment. ARFID typically onsets in early childhood, yet identification of the disorder is poor. The end result is that children often have sustained inadequate nutrition with resulting severe physical consequences and threats to optimal social and emotional development. Early intervention is essential. However, there are no em- pirically validated treatments for young children with ARFID. Children with ARFID are known to be sensitive individuals: with a low threshold for noticing internal body sensations (e.g., gastrointestinal distress) and exter- nal sensory sensations (e.g., smells) and experiencing these sensations as uncomfortable/aversive. This sen- sitivity, and the associated negative emotional reactions (e.g., of disgust, fear, sadness), may encourage avoidance of activities that cause these sensory experiences, such as eating. An intervention that could change reactions to sensory and somatic sensations to one of playful curiosity may increase approach behav- ior and food consumption. We designed an acceptance-based interoceptive exposure treatment for children to achieve this goal. We teach children and caregivers to be “FBI Agents,” individuals who view somatic and sen- sory sensations as clues to a mystery via the use of engaging illustrative cartoon characters (e.g., Gassy Gus), body investigations that provoke intense sensations and worksheets that map sensations to meanings and ac- tions. The goal is to make somatic and sensory experiences playful – and to promote adaptive self-awareness and food approach. The overall objective of this study is to determine whether treatment results in reduced negative emotions to somatic and sensory sensations, including those associated with food and eating, and whether this, in turn, increases food approach. This will be accomplished by a randomized controlled trial (N = 140, 70 per cell) comparing The Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI) - ARFID Division treatment, a 20-session outpatient treatment, to a control group in children (5 to 9 years of age) with ARFID. The control treatment (FAD: Family-Assisted Diet) will provide family-supported exposure. Our proposed mediator of treatment re- sponse is negative affect: a child’s facial affect in response to food presentation as measured via smartphone videos. Outcomes include changes in anthropometric measurements, nutrition variety and adequacy, and psy- chosocial functioning. Medical and psychological measurements will be assessed pre- and post-treatment, at every session, and 3-month follow-up. Deliverables include an empirically validated treatment(s); medical guidelines for the early detection of insufficient nutrition; practical tools for assessing food acceptance in the home via smartphones; and guidance about the number of food presentations necessary to facilitate acceptance. Ultimately, we will evaluate this treatment and disseminate materials via primary care to provide tools to intervene early on food avoidance. Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a disorder in which individuals are not able to consume an adequate amount or variety of food to a degree that it affects their growth. The goal of this project is to compare 2 treatments and see which one (or both) is effective in treating ARFID in children. As a result of this project, we will have tested treatments for children with ARFID; developed medical guidelines for the early detection of insufficient nutrition; developed practical tools for assessing food acceptance in the home via smartphones; and have acquired practical guidance about the number of times parents need to present food to get their child to like it.",Feeling and Body Investigators (FBI)-ARFID Division: Sensory and Somatic Exposure for Children with Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,10286200,R33MH121549,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Cartoons ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Curiosities ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Diet Fads ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' nutrition ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vomiting ', ' Emesis ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' re-treatment ', ' Retreatment ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Approach-avoidance conflict ', ' approach avoidance behavior ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' food consumption ', ' feeding ', ' approach behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' 9 year old ', ' 9 years of age ', ' age 9 years ', ' nine year old ', ' nine years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' arm ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' family support ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' food avoidance ', ' avoidant restrictive food intake disorder ', ' dietary ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R33,2021,753701
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)

"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem

"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Program Development ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration Disorders ', ' Respiratory Disorder ', ' breathing disorder ', ' respiratory dysfunction ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Tryptophan ', ' L-Tryptophan ', ' Levotryptophan ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Woman ', ' Mediating ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Communication Research ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' asthmatic ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Formulation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,10086375,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins ', ' Acute-Phase Reactants ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Serum amyloid A protein ', ' Amyloid A Precursor ', ' Amyloid A Protein-Related Serum Component ', ' Amyloid Protein AA Precursor ', ' Amyloid Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid Serum Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid-Related Serum Protein (SAA) ', ' Serum A Related Protein ', ' Serum Amyloid A ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Archives ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Proteins ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Haptoglobins ', ' Immunoassay ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Care ', ' baby care ', ' infant health care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' newborn care ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer

"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in

"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' mortality ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Nephrology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Muscle function ', ' Individual ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dietitian ', ' Kilogram ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' muscle strength ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' obesity management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' morphogens ', ' differentiation factors ', ' morphogenic factors ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' data registry ', ' healthy weight ', ' clinical predictors ', ' reduced muscle strength ', ' decreased muscle strength ', ' dynapenia ', ' low muscle strength ', ' muscle strength decline ', ' predictive tools ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' stakeholder perspectives ', ' stakeholder insights ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetic Nephropathy ', ' Diabetic Kidney Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNFR ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' diabetic ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' aptamer ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Proteome ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' complement pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' CCL2 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 2 ', ' MCAF ', ' MCP-1 ', ' MCP1 ', ' Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Protein ', ' Monocyte Chemotactive and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Secretory Protein JE ', ' SCYA2 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A2 ', ' CCL2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' stem ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' primary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' complement system ', ' study population ', ' random forest ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications.

We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",6/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10149813,U01DK048375,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U01,2021,388986
"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,10171413,R01HL142994,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Colorado ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Ventricle ', ' Cardiac Ventricles ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Common Ventricle ', ' Absence of interventricular septum ', ' Cor triloculare biatriatum ', ' single functional ventricle ', ' single ventricle ', ' univentricular heart ', ' Critically ill children ', ' critically ill child ', ' base ', ' Patient Monitoring System ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Lesion ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Blood flow ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Palliative Surgery ', ' news ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' Pediatric cardiology ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,575613
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', '

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10183157,R01AI153405,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Aspergillus ', ' Azoles ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Candida ', ' Monilia ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' fungus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"2/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center ABSTRACT Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre- diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer- term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%. During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well- characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. NARRATIVE The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",2/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10156159,U01DK048381,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,U01,2021,403058
"Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation ABSTRACT During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac- centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species- level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and 2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro- biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com- munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first 9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta- genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe- cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe- function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first 4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char- acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin- sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot- ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition, resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re- search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi- ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses our gap in understanding how the early life human gut microbiome responds to diet and antibiotics, including impacts on functional maturation and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. This research is relevant for public health because it will improve our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and diet on microbiome dynamics beyond the coarse level of microbial communities and establish predictive models for future personalized antibiotic treatment and dietary recommendations that minimize collateral damage and maximize development of the healthy infant microbiome. By complementing data from two unique human cohorts with hypothesis testing in a mouse model this project is relevant to the NIH's mission of leveraging basic research in mechanisms of health and disease to improve outcomes in treatment and maintenance of human health.",Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation,10298201,R01AI155893,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Clinical, imaging, and endoscopic outcomes of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic goals in pediatric Crohn’s Disease (CD) have shifted from clinical improvement or remission to endoscopic healing (EH) by ileocolonoscopy and transmural healing (TH) by magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This shift happened because patients who achieve complete healing (CH, TH and EH) experience lower rates of subsequent hospitalization, therapy escalation, or surgery than those with EH alone or no healing. We hypothesize that specific pre-treatment clinical, radiologic, genomic, and microbial factors along with attainment of targeted anti-TNF biologic exposure will be associated with the primary endpoint, CH, and the major secondary endpoints, EH and TH, 52 weeks after anti-TNF start.. We will test this hypothesis in a prospective cohort study of 570 newly diagnosed pediatric-onset CD subjects who initiate treatment with anti-TNF medication within 6 months of diagnosis. We will administer personalized anti-TNF biologic therapy guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using a novel dosing algorithm which we developed. Aim 1. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline measures of clinical and radiologic severity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment nutritional status, antimicrobial serologies, and MRE findings will be associated with CH 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Formal hypothesis tests will be carried out to confirm the predictive power of a set of pre-specified measures using a logistic regression model. We will also conduct exploratory analyses of novel predictors, identified via machine learning methods, to assess their relationship with CH after adjusting for the confirmed primary predictors. Aim 2. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline host and microbial genomic and metabolic factors. We hypothesize that pre-treatment gene expression signatures and microbial factors will be associated with year 1 CH. We will characterize the host genotype, longitudinal microbial taxonomic and metabolomic profiles, and ileal and colon host epigenome and transcriptome at baseline and at 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Aim 3. Use a k-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal predictive model of year 1 CH. We hypothesize that a model which includes host gene signatures and microbes will improve prediction of CH beyond one based on clinical and imaging factors alone. The model will include significant clinical and imaging predictors from Aim 1 and the subset of baseline host and microbial characteristics found to be potentially explanatory in Aim 2. Impact. The proposed inception cohort study, CAMEO, will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to healing in pediatric CD that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed inception cohort study CAMEO will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to bowel healing in pediatric Crohn's disease that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches. Achieving higher rates of bowel healing will improve quality of life, mitigate need for surgery and hospitalizations, and potentially reduce long term healthcare expenditures.","Clinical, imaging, and

"Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants Project Summary Our proposal is motivated by the need to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring anemia in very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) and reduce the number of routine painful, invasive blood sampling procedures (phlebotomy) that may alter infant neurodevelopment and behavior. Recently, a new smartphone application [Mannino et al., Nature Communications, 9, 4924 (2018)] that collects and analyzes clinical pallor in patient-sourced fingernail photos and image metadata has been developed to predict hemoglobin levels. The app uses a robust multi-linear regression model that incorporates summary color intensity values (average across pixels) of fingernail photos well as the image metadata generated by the device capturing the image to predict patient's hemoglobin level. While the current app algorithm is simple and easy to implement, there are notable limitations. First, it does not fully leverage the rich spatial information available in fingernail photos by calculating a simple average value. Second, the current algorithm is trained using only adults, whose clinical characteristics are vastly different from infants. The 95% limit of agreement between the app-predicted and blood sample-based hemoglobin level for adults is reported as 2.4 g/dL, which is higher than the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments specification variance of 1.0 g/dL, and will likely increase in VLBW infants given their tiny, non-specific fingernail beds. Such strict error requirements and heterogeneity in populations demand more accurate and tailored algorithms than what the current app employs. Lastly, a framework for applying the app to minimize blood draws across the longitudinal care continuum for VLBW infants is currently lacking. With these considerations, we propose (Aim 1) to develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that produces non-invasive, accurate and stable prediction of hemoglobin level. The IAA will be based on a novel principal component analysis method that provides a non-parametric and parsimonious means to jointly model high- dimensional photos and image metadata, while fully leveraging their spatial structures and co-varying patterns. We will also consider a new partial least squares approach as an alternative method. We will train and validate the IAA based on adult data as well as VLBW infant data. In Aim 2, we will develop a new clustering method to study sub-population structures of fingernail photos and image metadata and study their relationships with the underlying physiological mechanisms of anemia. This approach will allow us to formulate a non-invasive image- based screening tool by identifying clusters of VLBW infants with high anemia risk. In Aim 3, we will develop data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-level clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of blood draws in VLBW infants throughout the care continuum. Our proposal will use the data of VLBW infants monitored at three level III neonatal intensive care units in Atlanta. The proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of settings with diverse and complex modalities of clinical data. Project Narrative Anemia of prematurity occurs in nearly all very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) infants who survive the initial postnatal course, and its main cause is blood loss from routine phlebotomy for its diagnosis. The proposed research project will develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that analyzes full structural information of clinical pallor in fingernail photos to enable accurate, non-invasive prediction of blood hemoglobin level and anemia risk among VLBW infants. We will develop various data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-specific clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of invasive blood sampling procedures throughout the care continuum for VLBW infants.",Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants,10279575,R01HL159213,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anemia ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complete Blood Count ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pallor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Fingernail ', ' Measurement ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' inflammatory disease of the intestine ', ' gut inflammation ', ' inflammatory disorder of the intestine ', ' intestinal autoinflammation ', ' intestinal inflammation ', ' infant monitoring ', ' infant measurement ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' postnatal period ', ' post-natal period ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ', ' intestinal injury ', ' injury to the intestines ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,546500
"Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology Enteric pathogen infections are a leading cause of the global disease burden, with the largest burden among children in low-resource settings. Stool-based PCR methods have dramatically improved our ability to measure enteric infections, but the challenge of collecting stool and need for near-continuous monitoring to detect many globally important pathogens has thwarted broader use in large-scale surveillance. Large-scale, population- based surveys now regularly collect blood to monitor transmission and burden of diseases such as HIV, malaria and dengue. Broader testing of blood collected in such surveys with multiplex assays represents a new opportunity to measure enteric pathogen transmission and burden. Antibody-based measures could complement stool-based PCR testing because antibody responses remain elevated for many months after infection, thus providing more information in studies with infrequent measurements. Our team has developed multiplex bead assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens. In preliminary studies we have shown that IgG levels can be used to measure heterogeneity in enteric pathogen transmission between populations. We have also shown the results generalize to pathogens that span taxa. In this application, we propose to complete a series of studies that address key next steps to advance the seroepidemiology of enteric pathogens in low-resource settings. We will conduct a longitudinal birth cohort in Ecuador that pairs high resolution, multiplex stool-based PCR infection with longitudinal, multiplex IgG and IgA measurements. Our 17- year research history at the site has documented substantial variation in enteric pathogen infection across a rural-urban gradient, making it an ideal setting for the research. The cohort will enroll 600 children from three sites across a rural-urban gradient, and measure them frequently from birth to 24 months. On the Luminex platform, we will pair multiplex PCR assessment for 15 enteric pathogens with IgG and IgA assessment in a multiplex bead assay that includes antigens to 7 enteric pathogens: Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and norovirus. In Aim 1, we will use molecular and antibody-based measures to study force of infection of the enteric pathogens across a rural-urban gradient. This will represent the first broad-based comparison of seroepidemiologic measures against patent infection for enterics. In Aim 2, we will estimate enteric pathogen force of infection by applying current-status models to population-based, cross-sectional serology surveys in the region, and will benchmark the cross-sectional estimates against those obtained in the concurrent longitudinal study. In Aim 3, we will study IgG and IgA kinetics following infection for each of the 7 pathogens, and develop models to accurately predict recent infections and incidence from antibody levels measured in cross-sectional serology surveys. Completion of these aims will result in generalizable seroepidemiologic methods that have the potential to transform measurement of enteric pathogen transmission and burden in low-resource settings. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Pathogens that cause diarrheal disease account for an immense global public health burden, primarily among young children in low-resource settings. The use of antibodies to study the epidemiology of diarrhea-causing pathogens has potential to improve our measurement of pathogen transmission in research and surveillance. This project will advance the epidemiologic methods used to measure diarrhea-causing pathogen exposure at the population level, by completing the first comprehensive study that pairs antibody-based and stool-based measures of infection among a birth cohort living across a rural-urban gradient in Ecuador.",Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using

"Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently over 7.4 million people in the US have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 and over 215,000 have died. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, which disproportionally affects elderly patients. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 triggers such severe pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recent clinical studies have suggested that cell death, especially the induction of necroptosis, may be predictor of severe COVID-19 disease. The mechanism by which the host restricts necroptosis is unclear. In the preliminary data we have shown that the interferon induced protein, ISG15, acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis and its downstream inflammatory responses during viral infection. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 induces necroptosis and that ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells. We will use in vitro primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTECs) and an in vivo mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 animal model to ask several questions including: 1) Does SARS- CoV2 induce necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells; 2) Does ISG15 modulate necroptotic cell death as well as proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV2 infection?; 3) Does necroptosis and its regulation by ISG15 contribute to SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? Overall, our studies will provide important insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection and provide potential insight into mechanisms underlying severe disease, which may direct efforts toward the development of diagnostic markers and future countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear why certain populations, particularly the elderly, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this work is to determine whether excessive inflammatory cell death, regulated by ISG15 and RIPK3, acts as a key factor in severe COVID-19 disease.",Regulation of Cell Death and

"Infant Functional Connectome Fingerprinting based on Deep Learning Project Abstract Functional connectome fingerprinting is to discover the reliable and robust individualized functional connectivity patterns that are capable of accurately distinguishing one individual from others, like the “fingerprint”. To date, the fingerprinting capability of functional connectome has been widely observed from older children to adolescents to adults. Meanwhile, the most contributive functional connections for fingerprinting are consistently identified as the most predictive ones for cognitive performance. However, functional connectome fingerprinting during infancy featuring the most dynamic postnatal brain development remains uninvestigated, which is essential for understanding the early individual-level intrinsic patterns of functional organization, the relationship of inter-individual distinguishability with distinct behavioral phenotypes, as well as aberrant patterns associated with prenatal drug exposure. Two major obstacles prevent from investigation of infant functional connectome fingerprint: 1) there exist significant challenges in precisely processing infant neuroimages, which typically exhibit extremely low contrast, dynamic imaging appearance, morphological and functional changes; 2) conventional methods for functional connectome fingerprinting simply use the linearly-transformed, low-order functional connectivity features and are thus unable to separate the intrinsically-entangled identity-related individualized information and age-related developmental information in infant brains. To fill critical gaps in both methodology and knowledge, this project aims to develop an innovative dedicated deep learning model for infant functional connectome fingerprinting, thus addressing three fundamental questions in neurodevelopment: 1) whether the individualized functional connectome fingerprint exists during early brain development; 2) which functional connections contribute more to fingerprinting during infancy; 3) what is the association of infant functional connectome fingerprint with cognitive performance and adverse prenatal drug exposure. Our team is well positioned to conduct this project, as we have extensive experiences in developing infant-dedicated computational tools and deep learning techniques and have acquired multiple longitudinal infant datasets involving both typically developing infants and infants with prenatal drug exposure. Two specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will develop a deep neural network model for infant functional connectome fingerprinting. Specifically, to boost the discriminative capability of the functional connectivity features, we will develop a triplet autoencoder model to map these features into a new feature space with high-order discriminative information. To restrain the interference from the developmental information, we will disentangle the latent variables from the triple autoencoder into identity-code, age-code, and noise-code, and meanwhile design multiple specific losses to enforce the disentanglement. In Aim 2, we will explore the key contributive connections for fingerprinting and their association with cognition performance and adverse prenatal drug exposure. Our computational models, codes and discoveries will be released to public to greatly advance baby brain connectome studies. Project Narrative The proposed research will fill critical knowledge gaps on the existence of infant functional connectome fingerprint, the key contributive functional connections for fingerprinting, and their association with cognitive performance and adverse prenatal drug exposure. This work is important for understanding the individual-level early brain functional organization and developmental mechanisms and how infant functional connectome fingerprint may be altered by environmental challenges.",Infant Functional Connectome Fingerprinting based on Deep Learning,10288361,R21MH127544,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Research ', ' Triplet Multiple Birth ', ' Triplets ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Surface ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' association cortex ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' reconstruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' fetal drug exposure ', ' gestational drug exposure ', ' prenatal drug exposure ', ' prenatally drug exposed ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective intervention ', ' cognitive performance ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' connectome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' random forest ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,155500
"Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment after Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are now recognized as a key pathogenic factor in dementia, and represent a promising target for intervention. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. However, the impact of APOs on maternal VCID remains unexamined. Most existing women's cardiovascular and aging cohorts lack rigorously phenotyped, prospectively collected pregnancy data, and the impact of maternal factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID is not well understood. From 2010-2013, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study enrolled a diverse cohort of 10,037 healthy women at 8 US academic medical centers, who were followed from early in conception through the delivery of their first child. Several years later, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) brought back 4,475 nuMoM2b women for a second study wave, to characterize subsequent pregnancy outcomes and accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors following pregnancy. A third study wave of in-person visits will begin in early 2022. In this ancillary study, we propose to conduct neurocognitive assessments on all nuMoM2b-HHS participants during this third study wave. We will perform brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a sub-cohort of 250 women followed at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center study site, including all who experienced APOs in the index pregnancy. The overall goal of the study is to capitalize on this unique obstetric cohort to determine the impact of APOs on long term maternal VCID, through the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the impact of APOs on maternal cognition 10-15 years after delivery by comparing global cognition scores between women who experienced APOs and women who did not; (2) Determine the impact of APOs on MRI biomarkers of maternal VCID, including white matter hyperintensity volume and additional markers of cerebral small vessel disease. We hypothesize that the association of APOs with VCID markers will be partially mediated by development of new hypertension after the index pregnancy. As an exploratory aim, we will use deep pregnancy phenotyping, including maternal characteristics, biomarkers of ischemic placental disease and APOs, to create a VCID prediction model. This will be the first US study to use prospectively collected pregnancy data to investigate the impact of APOs, a sex-specific vascular risk factor, on VCID in women. Understanding the effects of APOs on early markers of VCID could help us identify women early in life who are at higher risk of dementia, and develop preventive strategies to thwart the progression of cognitive decline in this population. In addition, the collection of neurocognitive assessments on the entire nuMoM2b-HHS cohort during this study wave is an important investment, which will provide baseline data for future studies as these women continue to age.

"Spatiotemporal and functional convergence of genes implicated in ASD SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.",Spatiotemporal and functional convergence of genes implicated in ASD,10448049,U01MH115747,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment

"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The proposed COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) will develop models and biomarkers that predict risk for severe disease in children and adolescents by systematically integrating social science, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, immunological, and computational

"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile

"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10267180,R01EB029944,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neonate ', ' feeding ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Problem ', ' Outcome ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification algorithm ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Social outcome ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,505593
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,10220354,R01MH118217,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' putamen ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Tic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Motor Tics ', ' Vocal Tics ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' brain volume ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' 7 year old ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' 12 years of age ', ' age 12 years ', ' twelve year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' cognitive ability ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,559759
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10220094,R01HD095861,"['Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' brain shape ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' neural model ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' white matter change ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' brain remodeling ', ' cognitive task ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' learning outcome ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Myelin Sheath ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Cell Density ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' myelination ', ' phonology ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' literate ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,532331
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes.

"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",10208658,U01MH115747,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that

"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Affect ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Body Temperature ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Evolution ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ketamine ', ' Libraries ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Sucrose ', ' Saccharose ', ' Suggestion ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anhedonia ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Response Elements ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' data structure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' neural network ', ' circadian ', ' forced swim test ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10202575,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,1030383
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10246192,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' Phages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Caudovirales ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' parasite infection ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Norwalk-like Viruses ', ' Norovirus ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Preparation ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' metagenome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' virome ', ' viral microbiome ', ' human virome ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' genome annotation ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' dark matter ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' bacteriome ', ' bacterial microbiome ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' contig ', ' enteric virus infection ', ' enteric viral infection ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2021,1809005
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10251022,K01HD093863,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Cities ', ' Commuting ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demography ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Workplace ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Dependence ', ' Location ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Population Group ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Computational Technique ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' population health ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Data Science ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Child Health ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2021,137416
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and

"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,10188635,R01MH114999,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nonverbal Communication ', ' non-verbal communication ', ' paralinguistic behavior ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' gaze ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' joint attention ', ' cost effective ', ' social communication ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' common treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' arm movement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' recruit ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,333604
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model. Successful devel- opment of the technology will enable precise antibiotic prescriptions and accurate treatment of the patient on the same day of visit. !",Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells,10188407,R01AI138993,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Arizona ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' biosensing ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Coliform Bacilli ', ' Enteric Bacteria ', ' Enterobacteria ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Point of Care Technology ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' light scattering ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Speed ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Validation ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' Virotherapy ', ' Virotherapeutics ', ' carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Extended-spectrum β-lactamase ', ' Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' point-of-care diagnosis ', ' ']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2021,1079736
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,10181076,R01MH096773,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,10198671,R01MH104030,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anniversary ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physiology ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Tic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", "" Guinon's disease "", ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', ' Tourette Syndrome ', "" Tourette's "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Syndrome "", ' maladie des tics ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Life ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Appearance ', ' Sampling ', ' Advertisements ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' habit learning ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' medical attention ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' dexterity ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' support vector machine ', ' tic suppression ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,626493
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic

"BRAIN Initiative: Assessing development of event-related cortical network dynamics Project Summary The Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network (HBN) is an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of brain and behavioral data now being collected from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). In response to RFA-MH-120-20 (‘Integration and analysis of BRAIN Initiative data’), we will collect their high-density EEG and continuous eye tracking data, recorded from now over 3,000 young participants while they watch movies and rest, plus participant MR head images, to create a developmental EEG and eye tracking data and analysis resource within the BRAIN Initiative-funded NEMAR portal (NEMAR.org) to the OpenNeuro human neuroimaging resource (OpenNeuro.org). We will store the data in accord with the latest advances in the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS), including innovative co-registration of eye-tracking information and EEG, extraction of anonymized Leadfield matrices for advanced participant-based source localization, and Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) annotation of movie and eye tracking events in the data, to enable sophisticated exploratory and model-based analyses by any user of the Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), which offers processing of complex tasks on the U.S. XSEDE computer network (XSEDE.org) for users of standard neuroscience software. We propose to build on the large existing and readily extensible set of tools for analysis, modeling, and visualization of human EEG data in the world leading EEGLAB software environment for electrophysiological signal processing we develop and maintain (5R01-NS047293-15) (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), to process the large corpus of innovative EEG and synchronous eye tracking data recorded during movie viewing by the HBN project. We will then apply source-resolved event-related analysis models to cortical EEG network dynamics associated with movie watching, will model their changes across development, and will compare the time course of these changes with changes in eye gaze patterns at the same age levels. We will use cortical source-resolved, event-related functional EEG connectivity measures implemented in the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT) to model event-related EEG dynamics of individual participants, and will apply advanced hierarchical Bayes-based methods and statistical assessment to perform statistical testing on subject group models. We will study the development of event-related cortical information flow during movie watching and rest across the large HBN developmental (5-21 years) sample, and compare it to the developmental trajectory of changes in eye gaze patterns during movie viewing.

"Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting about 340 million people worldwide, yet its causal biology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain under-characterized. This difficulty is partly due to clinical heterogeneity, as different risk factors drive asthma for different people. Asthma subtype studies have already begun to reveal important aspects of this heterogeneity. However, asthma subtypes remain nascent and ambiguous and have not yet realized their potential utility for scientific studies and precision treatments. In particular, genetics has not been fully exploited for asthma subtyping, though it has a unique ability to assess the causal biological significance of subtypes and can identify key cell types; conversely, prior subtyping studies are susceptible to coincidental subtypes that are not directly relevant to asthma biology. Furthermore, prior studies have used basic methods which are liable to bias and low power. To address these limitations, we will develop a powerful and robust framework to pinpoint and genetically characterize asthma subtypes, and we will broadly apply it in large, deeply phenotyped, and diverse cohorts. Our study will identify novel subtypes and their demographic, genomic, cellular, and clinical etiologies, which can suggest precision treatments and improve power and interpretation in basic and translational research. Our work will improve genetic prediction of asthma, particularly in understudied populations. Finally, our approach and freely released methods will provide a broad template for complex trait subtyping. To accomplish these goals, we will study four large biobanks, which offer unprecedented sample size, clinical depth, and demographic diversity. We will use functional genomics to link genetic heterogeneity to causal and cell type-specific molecular mechanisms. We will build on our prior machine learning tools to identify subtypes, quantify their genetic and clinical significance, and infer their dominant cell types. Our methods are unique by correcting for confounding population structure, which is crucial for genetic subtyping: spurious genetic associations led prior studies to propose severely biased and regressive nosology. A key goal of this proposal is the PI’s retraining in asthma biology, pulmonology, and functional genomics. This will be achieved by close mentorship from Professors Carole Ober, Julian Solway, Yoav Gilad, and Matthew Stephens, as well as didactic courses in the UChicago Department of Medicine and Institute for Translational Medicine. This retraining will maximize the biomedical impact of our study by enabling the PI to deeply connect quantitative results to core facets of asthma pathology and will establish the PI as an independent asthma researcher who can optimally apply his statistics and machine learning background to tackle essential biomedical hurdles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is a chronic and increasingly common disease, yet its causal etiology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain largely unclear, which is partly due to asthma’s extreme heterogeneity. We will develop a powerful and robust machine learning model to identify and characterize genetic asthma subtypes, especially their specific cellular etiologies, in large, diverse, deeply phenotyped biobanks; these subtypes will improve power and interpretation in scientific studies and advance precision medicine. The PI’s retraining in respiratory biology and close mentorship from world experts will maximize the biomedical impact of our inferred genetic subtypes and establish the PI’s independent asthma research program.",Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma,10191398,K25HL157603,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' respiratory ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' translational medicine ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K25,2021,140562
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease, with nearly 1.8 billion new cases per year globally. ECC afflicts approximately 55% of low-income and minority US preschool children, resulting in harmful short- and long-term effects on health and quality of life. The current biomedical approach to control the ECC pandemic has had limited success. It primarily focuses on restorative procedures rather than population-wide preventive strategies. Clinical evidence shows that caries is reversible if detected and addressed in its early stages. However, many low-income US children often have poor access to pediatric dental services. In this underserved group, dental caries is often diagnosed at a late stage when extensive restorative treatment is needed. We believe that with more than 85% of lower-income Americans owning a smartphone, mHealth tools hold great promise to achieve patient-driven early detection and risk control of ECC. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies that use mHealth tools to achieve early detection and prevention of ECC at a broad population base. Our previous innovative work has led to a novel prototype of an artificial intelligence (AI) -powered smartphone app, AICaries, to be used by children's parents/caregivers. This AICaries app prototype offers a) AI-powered caries detection using photos of children's teeth taken by the parents' smartphones, b) interactive caries risk assessment, and c) personalized education on reducing children's ECC risk. The preliminary AI- powered caries detection module demonstrated a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for front teeth caries detection, using 6,895 annotated tooth images from 1,277 photos. We have recently built an archive of > 100,000 high-quality intra-oral photos that is ready to be used for finalizing the development of a reliable automatic detection algorithm. The immediate objectives of the study are - AIM 1: complete the development of AICaries smartphone app, maximize its caries detection performance, and achieve a caries detection sensitivity and specificity that are comparable to trained dental practitioners; AIM 2: employ a community-based participatory research strategy to conduct moderated testing and refinement of the app usability, and non-moderated field testing of the app feasibility/acceptability. Our multidisciplinary team is well-positioned for proposal success with needed expertise in computer science, AI imaging recognition, oral health care, mHealth, disparity research, patient education and community engagement. The AICaries app could facilitate early detection of ECC for many underserved US children, who often have poor access to pediatric dental services. Using AICaries, parents can use their regular smartphones to take photo of their children’s teeth and detect ECC aided by AICaries, so that they can actively seek treatment for their children at an early and reversible stage of ECC. Using AICaries, parents can also obtain essential knowledge on reducing their children's caries risk. Data from this R21 will support a R01 clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this innovative smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children. Narrative Although largely preventable, early childhood caries (ECC) remains the most common chronic childhood disease, disproportionately afflicts vulnerable parts of the population and has a substantial adverse impact on children, families, and healthcare systems. Our multidisciplinary team is proposing to use an Artificial Intelligence-powered mHealth tool coupled with a community engagement strategy to revolutionize the detection and monitoring of ECC at the patient level, which may pave the way for improving oral heath among low-income children.",Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children,10105768,R21DE030251,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dentists ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' computer science ', ' microbial ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' performance tests ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' health literacy ', ' restorative treatment ', ' computerized ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' Minority ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' prototype ', ' population based ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2021,189800
"A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Project Summary Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also occur across a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders. RRB present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, interfere with family functioning and present a source of considerable stress for parents. Despite their clinical significance, underlying mechanisms behind this complex behavioral domain are poorly understood and effective, targeted, individually tailored treatment options are currently lacking. One of the major barriers to moving the RRB research agenda forward has been the lack of clarity around the structure and conceptualization of RRB and the limitations of the currently available measures, particularly in terms of their (i) inability to comprehensively capture the full range of RRB and (ii) lack of sensitivity to treatment-related change. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a parent report measure for comprehensive and quantitative RRB assessment applicable across clinical populations and across the life- span and useful in both etiological- and treatment-related research. In order to achieve this goal, we will first conduct advanced statistical analyses of multiple, large, high-quality datasets containing a range of currently available measures in order to achieve fine-grained differentiation between distinct RRB domains (Specific Aim 1) and to identify domains not adequately captured by the current measures (Specific Aim 2). The implementation of this initial phase of the project will ensure that robustness and generalizability of the factor structures for each individual measure across age, developmental level, gender, and diagnostic status, is established and that generalizable core RRB structure across the currently available RRB instruments is identified. Neither of these two different aspects have been comprehensively addressed before. Robust derived RRB factor structure, together with the identification of potential RRB domains that might be under- represented and not adequately depicted by the current instruments, together with the systematic review of the literature will inform the development of items of the new scale to capture the full range of RRB. The pilot version of the new scale will be psychometrically evaluated online within a large sample of children and adolescents with ASD (Specific Aim 3). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations aimed at further refinement of the newly developed informant-based scale and the development of a clinician interview and objective instrument, as well as their validation across ASD ansd neurodevelopmental disorders, and the testing of their utility as a clinical outcome measure. Project Narrative Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB), a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, and a source of stress and management challenges for families. In addition to utilizing existing large datasets to clarify the structure of RRB and develop comprehensive RRB taxonomy, this project will utilize the information gained from the innovative secondary data analysis to develop and pilot a newly developed comprehensive and sensitive RRB scale. This project will pave the way for new studies that will aim to further validate the new measure, explore its sensitivity to change and utility as an outcome in clinical trials and inform the development of new clinical observation and objective measurement tools.",A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors,10066368,R21MH121876,"['individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' adolescent with autism spectrum disorder ', ' adolescent with ASD ', ' adolescent with autism ', ' autistic adolescent ', ' autistic youth ', ' youth with ASD ', ' youth with autism ', ' youth with autism spectrum disorder ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Review Literature ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' compulsion ', ' behavioral construct ', ' behavior construct ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' Grain ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,197125
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden.

"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10224293,R01HD100469,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Teratogens ', ' Teratogenic ', ' Teratogenicity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Salivary ', ' postnatal ', ' System ', ' fetal stress ', ' prenatal stress ', ' respiratory ', ' fetal ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Impulsivity ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 4 year old ', ' 4 years of age ', ' age 4 years ', ' four year old ', ' four years of age ', ' critical period ', ' stress reactivity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617941
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects

"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,10215584,K23HD100594,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colistin ', ' Colimycin ', ' Colisticin ', ' Polymyxin E ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Hand ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hygiene ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' India ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening

"4/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) – Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,10151581,R01AI134982,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disasters ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Infection ', ' Modernization ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' septic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' neonatal sepsis ', ' intrapartum ', ' Viral ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' microbial ', ' melting ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' antibiotic resistant bacteria ', ' bacterial antibiotic resistant ', ' bacterial resistance to antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Validation ', ' point of care ', ' early onset ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' viral detection ', ' virus detection ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Neonatal ', ' pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' circulating DNA ', ' clinically actionable ', ' pathogen genome ', ' pathogenome ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' fungi pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' virus pathogen ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' detection limit ', ' emerging pathogen ', ' new pathogen ', ' novel pathogen ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,469594

"A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare Project Summary Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and, (b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health (and even beyond). Project Narrative Mental health, which accounts for a significant percentage of the global health burden, can be effectively managed through mobile and digital tools, yet suffers from limited access, inconsistent treatments, and qualitative approaches that do not scale. Taking aim at an increasingly pervasive and canonical mental health problem, autism, we plan to build a game-based solution that can treat (addressing issues social interaction, eye contact, and social-emotional awareness, among other things) while tracking progress, and that can automatically generate computer vision libraries for deep learning models that permit enhanced diagnostic feature extraction in the future.",A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare,10122795,R01LM013364,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Emotions ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Forehead ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' joint attention ', ' social reciprocity ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 8 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' prototype ', ' computer generated ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' Android ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' applied behavior analysis ', ' applied behavioral analysis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' feature extraction ', ' feasibility testing ', ' Home ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,667434
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney

"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,10176257,R01HD100542,"['Antibodies ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bifidobacterium ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological

"Rosie the Chatbot: Leveraging Automated and Personalized Health Information Communication to Reduce Disparities in Maternal and Child Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal has the potential to alter the way health information is presented to vulnerable populations. Our proposal promotes a more flexible and tailored approach to reach underserved groups. Racial/ethnic minority women are at increased risk for postpartum depression, and their children as less likely to have had well-child checkups in the past year. Moreover, racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant mortality as well as various health behaviors such as safe sleep practices, breastfeeding, and infant nutrition. Currently, some popular programs involve resource-intensive home visits (limited in scale due to staff and cost constraints) or non-personalized text messages (may not directly address an individual’s questions). We propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an individual’s specific informational needs. We have built a prototype of the chatbot, Rosie, capable of engaging in live question-and-answer sessions. Rosie is able to respond to 334 popular questions that new mothers may have. Pretests with mother groups and Mary’s Center patients have showed a positive reception to the chatbot. Over the course of the grant, we will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and the emergence of efforts to aggregate massive amounts of health information, to assemble a comprehensive health information library. We will further refine Rosie’s dialogue analyzer and response inference engine to robustly recognize and respond to user’s questions in the various and complex ways they can phrase a question. We will test the hypothesis that Rosie may lower risk of postpartum depression, decrease emergency room visits, and increase attendance of well-baby visits. We will employ primarily a virtual recruitment strategy to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this intervention on maternal and infant outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer science, biostatistics, and maternal and child health experts—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop technology for a chatbot, Rosie, that will provide health informational support to vulnerable mothers the moment they need it; 2) Evaluate the use of Rosie on maternal and infant outcomes; and 3) Release an open-source packet for the construction of a chatbot. Rosie provides informational support to vulnerable moms the moment they need it and safeguards new moms from misinformation that is common on the web with the ultimate goal of closing the gap in maternal and infant outcomes. Results and tools developed from this proposal can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant outcomes, and popular programs for vulnerable populations involve resource-intensive home visits or non-personalized health information materials. We propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an individual’s specific informational needs.

"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental

"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['Acrylates ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Chloramphenicol ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eye Infections ', ' Ocular Infections ', ' Gel ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Iron Chelating Agents ', ' Iron Chelates ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Penicillins ', ' Phenotype ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Polymers ', ' Research ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Drug Costs ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Agonist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Light Microscope ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' GU Infection ', ' Genitourinary infection ', ' infectious disease of genitourinary system ', ' urogenital infection ', ' Genitourinary System Infection ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pathogen ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' screening ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' SIRT1 gene ', ' SIRT1 ', ' Sirtuin 1 ', ' chlamydia vaccine ', ' Drug Screening ', ' human pathogen ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Chlamydia genome ', ' chlamydial genome ', ' ']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243
"Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development, revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as 1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at 36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants, and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by atypical social communication and behavioral repertoire. The current studies aim to reveal how sensorimotor impairments may underlie, contribute, and regulate the neurobiology of this condition in toddlers recruited from the general population during the 2nd year of life and who were assessed for ASD vs. non-ASD outcomes during the 3rd year of life. Features of the neurobiologically grounded subtypes of ASD developed as part of this proposal will be used in future studies to predict diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in children with low-functioning form of ASD, those at risk for developing ASD, and those children with related disorders of neurodevelopment.",Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers,10127705,R01MH121605,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Noise ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Siblings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Head Movements ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' sensory motor system ', ' sensorimotor system ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' social communication ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' cognitive development ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' predictive signature ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2021,360836
"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic
