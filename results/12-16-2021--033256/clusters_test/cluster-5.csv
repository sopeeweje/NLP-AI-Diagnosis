"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning

"Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and Post-COVID-19 Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Recent data show that 10-30% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients do not fully recover and suffer from a wide range of symptoms that persist after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been cleared (so-called post- COVID-19 syndrome or Long Hauler). Severe COVID-19 and associated risk factors appear to increase the risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome and yet a substantial number of patients without known risk factors also develop post-COVID-19 syndrome. Thus, additional risk factors leading to post-COVID-19 syndrome must exist. One potential risk factor is excessive alcohol consumption. (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States, and alcohol use increases during public health crises, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged communities. (2) Alcohol results in inappropriate immune responses to pathogens. (3) Alcohol disrupts intestinal and lung barrier integrity which can further promote inflammation. We recently showed that increased serum Zonulin (a marker of disrupted intestinal barrier integrity) and increased endotoxin (LBP) are associated with inflammation during COVID-19 and can predict disease severity and mortality. Accordingly, we hypothesize that: (a) there is a bidirectional interaction between alcohol misuse and SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to increased risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and more severe AUD in COVID-19 patients; and (b) the underlying mechanism of these interactions is microbiota dysbiosis and/or disruption of intestinal barrier integrity, promoting inflammation and dysregulated immune-responses to the virus. To test our hypotheses, we will leverage our NIAAA supported COVID-19 supplement at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which is actively following more than 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 2,000 SARS- CoV-2 negative patients over 12 months using structured questionnaires. All patients are screened for alcohol use/misuse. Furthermore, we will recruit a subset of patients to provide biological samples to test our mechanistic hypothesis evaluating the link between AUD, post-COVID-19 syndrome, and gut-derived inflammation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that AUD increases the risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome by promoting gut-derived inflammation. (1a) We will determine if increased alcohol use/misuse is associated with risk and severity of post-COVID-19 syndrome. (1b) We will elucidate the role of gut-derived inflammation in AUD promotion of the post-COVID-19 syndrome by interrogating stool microbiota composition/function, systemic markers of intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, and immune activation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that COVID-19 increases the risk and severity of AUD and alcohol-induced intestinal barrier disruption. (2a) we will determine whether post-COVID-19 syndrome is associated with increased risk of AUD. (2b) We will determine if COVID-19 decreases resilience of intestinal barrier to the damaging effects of alcohol which would result in increased risk of alcohol-induced intestinal leak that could lead to organ damage using organoids generated from individuals with and without post-COVID-19 and/or AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand the role of alcohol consumption in COVID-19 long-term complications, hypothesizing that alcohol is an underappreciated risk factor for developing these complications. We also hypothesize that these effects are related to alcohol's ability to cause gut-leakiness during human diseases. The completion of this proposal may identify alcohol misuse (a modifiable lifestyle factor) as a yet unknown risk factor for COVID-19 long-term complications; therefore, it may lead to identify individuals at risk for these long-term complications and to design novel strategies to prevent/treat post-COVID-19 syndrome.",Microbiota-Mediated Bidirectional Interactions Between Alcohol Misuse and

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data This Diversity Supplement award for predoctoral candidate Kyla-Rose Walden under the primary mentorship of Professor Susan Luczak aims to both advance the objectives of the parent R01 AA026238 grant “Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data (PIs Luczak & Rosen)” and to support the research training and career advancement of Ms. Walden in her first 20 months in the University of Southern California clinical sciences psychology doctoral program in the Department of Psychology. The goal of the R01 parent study is to produce software to convert transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) data into estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (eBrAC/eBAC). Devices are now available to reliably measure TAC, the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of BrAC/BAC across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The anticipated result of this R01 study is the development of the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. This Supplement will focus on aspects of Aims 2 and 3 of the parent R01, specifically Aim 2b: to examine alternative options for calibrating the models developed by the mathematics team, and Aim 3: to package the models into the BrAC Estimator software program that can be used by non-mathematicians. During the time of this Supplement award, we will collect data on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and two laboratory drinking sessions. We also will have 20 researchers and clinicians run our software to process field trial data to determine the ease of its use in research and clinical settings. Ms. Walden will assist with these data collection efforts. In addition, she will receive broader training a) in alcohol theory and real-time (laboratory and field) alcohol research design from mentor/PI Luczak, b) in the basics of mathematical modeling approaches, data integration/consolidation, and MATLAB coding basics from MPI Rosen and Co-I Wang, and c) from Co-Is and research staff on the parent R01 in their given areas of expertise, and d) in preparing first-author manuscripts and presenting her research at conferences. She will use the data she has helped collect to develop her independent research in her first and second years of graduate school. This research is not redundant with the originally proposed outcomes of this R01 study, yet is within the study’s scope. We will extend this master’s level research into her dissertation in her third and fourth years of graduate training as part of an F31 award application. This supplement is appropriate for Ms. Walden’s stage of research development and will contribute intellectually to the R01 research, enhance Ms. Walden’s research skills and knowledge, and provide opportunities for her career development to become a productive researcher who makes substantial and meaningful contributions to the field of alcohol research. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating

"Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption Project Summary Alcohol use disorder has a major impact on public health, yet the brain mechanisms driving alcohol misuse are poorly understood. Habits are repetitive motor sequences that persist despite reward devaluation and form the action strategy that underlies compulsive behavior. Chronic alcohol exposure facilitates habit learning and leads to increased habitual behavior in chronic users. The dorsolateral striatum (the putamen in humans) regulates habit learning and its resident inhibitory cells, the fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), are targeted by alcohol exposure. To determine if alcohol utilizes FSIs to promote compulsive alcohol consumption, I selectively ablated striatal FSIs in animals undergoing a voluntary intermittent drinking paradigm (Drinking in the Dark) and challenged animals with the adulterant quinine to measure compulsive consumption. FSI ablation abolished compulsive alcohol consumption and significantly disrupted organized ethanol lick sequence behavior. The next essential step toward advancing this finding to a clinical application is to determine the specific time window that FSIs are recruited for the formation or maintenance of the motor sequences that underlie compulsive drinking. To this end I propose two aims of investigation using innovative optogenetic and machine learning approaches: 1) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the development of the organized actions of compulsive ethanol consumption and; 2) to determine if striatal FSIs are necessary for the maintenance of organized actions underlying compulsive ethanol consumption. The results of this study will significantly advance our understanding of motor sequence learning, the role of motor sequences in compulsive behavior, and will indicate the necessary time window for future therapeutic interventions targeting compulsive drinking. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder poses a substantial public health burden that is projected to increase in response to COVID- 19. Compulsive drinking is a core feature of the disorder that is poorly treated by current therapies. This proposal will determine how neural circuits exposed to alcohol give rise to compulsive alcohol consumption behavior and will provide critical training opportunities toward scientific independence for the principal investigator.",Striatal fast-spiking interneurons regulate compulsive alcohol consumption,10387913,F31AA029264,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Ethanol ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' ETOH ', ' Ethyl Alcohol ', ' Grain Alcohol ', ' Methylcarbinol ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' putamen ', ' Quinine ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Dorsal ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Ablation ', ' fluorophore ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' habit learning ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' sequence learning ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' alcohol exposure ', ' alcohol exposed ', ' ethanol exposed ', ' ethanol exposure ', ' exposed to alcohol ', ' exposed to ethanol ', ' exposure to alcohol ', ' exposure to ethanol ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' alcohol testing ', ' ethanol testing ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' treatment strategy ', ' alcohol-related death ', ' optogenetics ', ' Compulsive Behavior ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruit ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,F31,2021,38324
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187466,U24AA021697,"['Adolescence ',

"CNS Deficits:  Interaction of Age and Alcoholism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hazardous alcohol use has grown substantially in the aging population. It remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in classic irreversible dementia. Motivating the proposal are 1) our longitudinal findings of accelerated aging of selective brain structures in AUD; 2) results of an animal model of high alcohol exposure in old compared with young, well-nourished male and female rats; and 3) preliminary results from non-alcoholic individuals meeting MCI criteria compared with AUD with similar extent of cognitive deficits revealing different age-related patterns of brain degradation. The findings led us to consider factors of nutritional deficiency and cytokine dysregulation that occur in both AUD and MCI and have the potential to contribute to common and unique disruption, accelerated by aging, of selective brain circuitry and cognitive sequelae in each diagnosis. We will test 180 actively drinking men and women (60 AUD, 60 non-alcoholic MCI, and 60 age-matched controls) before and after 18-24 months with structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Recognizing mnemonic compromise associated with AUD and MCI, primary hypotheses will target the integrity of nodes and connections of Papez (limbic) circuit; white matter integrity will be assessed with deterministic fiber tracking and node-to-node integrity with probabilistic fiber tracking. Causal modeling will test the influence of specific independent variables of alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex hypothesized to have direct effects on inflammation and thalamic-hippocampal or cingulate-entorhinal connectivity, which, in turn, exert mediating influences on episodic memory. In addition to quantification of alcohol use and nutritional and inflammatory markers, modifiable risk factors to be examined include smoking, licit and illicit drugs, obesity-BMI, blood pressure, and physical activity. The parallel animal study will focus on the interaction of alcohol binge exposure and nutritional challenge with graded levels of thiamine deficiency and resulting cytokine, brain structure and connectivity, and behavioral sequelae in rats. AIM 1: In cross-sectional study, model for each diagnosis the influence of independent variables (i.e., alcohol, nutrition, age, and sex) and hypothesized mediating factors (i.e., inflammation) affecting neurocircuitry substrates of episodic memory. AIM 2: In longitudinal study, use trajectory analysis to quantify interim change in targeted neurocircuitry as a function of age. Causal modeling will use longitudinal change data of the independent variables. AIM 3: In longitudinal study, determine whether nutritional (thiamine) deficits are sufficient to produce enduring MR-detectable responses to high blood alcohol levels in wild-type Wistar rats. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among the aging population it remains unknown whether Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its alcohol-related cognitive and brain decline increases risk for diagnostic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even can result in a classic irreversible dementia. Characterization of brain pathology and its relation to cognitive deficits in AUD compared with MCI and identification of modifiable risk factors may provide biological markers and enhance mechanistic understanding of these disorders. Development of a translational animal model of AUD brain pathology will permit discovery of biological factors in addition to alcohol itself that contribute to brain damage and inform intervention and

"Optimizing Brief Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults via Computational Methods Project Summary The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek “protected time” for a period of intensive research focus to enhance the Candidate’s career development and to conduct research on the comparative effectiveness of competing brief alcohol interventions and their mechanisms. The proposed research strategy represents an ongoing, NIAAA-supported independent research program (R01 AA019511: Estimating Comparative Effectiveness of Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults, received 3rd percentile score). This K02 extends the R01 by (1) including an additional 25 data sets of individual participant data from brief alcohol interventions conducted between 2013 and 2020, and (2) embracing machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art statistical methods to help identify mechanisms of behavior change and to integrate and synthesize them across heterogeneous studies. The proposed protected time will be critical to update and enrich my research program in this current, rapidly changing clinical research environment. With accumulating high-quality clinical data and real-world data in the context of emerging data science capabilities, there exist opportunities as well as challenges. I am well suited to tackle emerging challenges for unprecedented opportunities, given my work in statistical data integration and broad experience in alcohol research. I want to create a large database where one can simultaneously examine secular/cohort effects, intervention effects, and effect heterogeneity at the most granular data level by developing and using new tools. My career goal is to become “one of the major hubs,” connecting disparate networks of researchers into a large connected network, promoting fluid interactions. The synergy from the large, interdisciplinary network would be helpful toward creating a “value” proposition of Big Data – the sum of the knowledge and insights from the collaboration by investigators is greater than isolated pursuits by each. Toward this goal, career development activities will be to (1) train in computational machine learning algorithms and real-world large-dimensional data analysis to facilitate collaboration with addiction researchers and statisticians; (2) enhance my understanding of technology-assisted adaptive interventions and passively collected outcomes data; (3) update my knowledge in basic health sciences related to addiction; and (4) submit at least two publications and two grants per year using newly acquired knowledge and skills proposed under K02. I have identified six highly active, nationally acclaimed experts in their respective fields. I will have individual and group research meetings with all six collaborators (three new collaborators for this K02) to develop innovative projects. In addition, I will attend workshops and conferences for training, carry out online training, and have guided reading and discussion with collaborators. I will visit collaborators for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Improving big data capabilities for biomedical and clinical research has been one of the major strategic plans of the NIH, and I am motivated and prepared to help meet that critical mission. Project Narrative Through innovative, comparative effectiveness research, we can improve interventions and develop individualized intervention strategies, which will reduce the serious negative consequences associated with heavy drinking and enhance the lives of adolescents and young adults. The results of this study will have a significant impact for all major stakeholders, including adolescents and young adults in need of treatment and their families, trial developers/researchers, school administrators.

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10227064,R01DA048764,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Cocaine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' interest ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,384135
"Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive EMA ABSTRACT Recovering from Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) following treatment is difficult, with 43-83% relapsing post- discharge. These chronically high rates arise, in part, because of a gap in our knowledge about the co-evolution of in the moment risk mechanisms associated with relapse among those recovering from AUD, including Craving, Negative Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol (CASA). These four factors co-evolve among important protective factors that buffer relapse risk (e.g., improved sober support and psychosocial function associated with post-treatment community AUD recovery programs), and context-based risk factors such as near-at-hand places where alcohol is available. The immediate goal of this project is to develop the means to assess and understand the impact of these environmental/contextual factors for recovering alcoholics, towards a longer term research objective of developing effective just-in-time interventions that mitigate the risk of relapse. In this project, we will leverage novel assessment methodologies via a responsive ecological momentary assessment (rEMA) system developed by our team. This app-based system allows researchers to incorporate geospatial, time- specific and event-specific criteria for enhanced monitoring of (and just-in-time delivery of interventions to) recovering patients in post-treatment settings. Consistent with PA-18-620 from NIAAA, this project aims to build foundational evidence and refine the data collection/analysis strategy needed to achieve our long term objective, via the following specific aims: Aim 1) Pilot the use of our rEMA platform to capture fine-grained longitudinal data on Craving, Affect, Stressors and Access to alcohol among 60 recovering alcoholics across 30 days, to evaluate CASA construct validity within rEMA data and assess the extent and impact of data missingness; Aim 2) Test incentive modalities that will inform us regarding best practices that maximize adherence to the rEMA protocol; Aim 3) Develop analytic strategies based machine-learning models of rEMA data, to forecast imminent risk and quantify causal pathways among CASA variables. To accomplish these aims, we will recruit and enroll adults (n=60; 50% female) in non-hospitalized residential AUD treatments in the Central Plains. Using smartphone assessment with GPS monitoring technology, we will collect longitudinal behavioral and experiential data from each participant over 30 days. Analysis of these data will advance our understanding of co-evolving contextual/social-environmental factors that impact the success/failure of the recovery effort, while establishing foundational evidence from which time/event-specific smartphone-based just-in-time interventions may be developed. The final phase of the project includes the creation of an advisory and dissemination board composed of local and national-level stakeholders, AUD treatment practitioners and other researchers that will guide the development of such an intervention. Included in this group are the directors of two non-hospitalized residential substance treatment facilities that function as community partners for the project through all project stages. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a significant need for reliable fine-grained data on the physical, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of relapse and recovery among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders. This study will use cutting-edge responsive ecological momentary assessment software to track craving, affect, stress, alcohol access, and exposure to support/risk locations among a cohort of 60 individuals currently participating in a non-hospitalized residential housing program. This data collection and modeling effort will set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of relapse and recovery risk patterns experienced by those with an alcohol use disorder, while supporting future cost-effective programming of relapse prevention and intervention services.","Mapping the co-evolution of Craving, Affect, Stressors, and Access to Alcohol (CASA) using responsive

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual

"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to

"Towards a Wearable Alcohol Biosensor: Examining the Accuracy of BAC Estimates from New-Generation Transdermal Technology using Large-Scale Human Testing and Machine Learning Algorithms A wearable alcohol biosensor could represent a tremendous advance towards helping people make informed decisions about their drinking and, ultimately, towards curbing alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Transdermal sensors, which measure alcohol consumption by assessing the alcohol content of insensible perspiration, offer a uniquely non-invasive, passive, and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of drinking likely to be attractive to a range of populations. But the relationship between transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is highly complex, varying across individuals and contexts and involving some degree of lag time. Prior research, which has featured extremely small participant samples and examined old-generation transdermal devices, has been poorly suited to modeling this complexity. Thus, scientists are left with little sense for how to translate data produced by transdermal sensors into estimates of BAC. Importantly, the past decade has seen remarkable technological and analytic developments, offering the potential to tackle the challenge of TAC-BAC translation. In particular, in recent years, machine learning approaches have been developed that are particularly well suited to modeling highly complex and time-lagged relationships within larger datasets. Also during this time period, a new generation of transdermal device has come under development, featuring sleek/compact designs, smartphone integration, and capabilities for sampling TAC at approximately 90 times the rate of older-generation devices. These sensors thus provide a rich source of data for machine learning models and also, for the first time, the potential to produce transdermal BAC estimates in real time. The proposed research leverages machine learning, novel transdermal technology, and large-scale multimodal human testing to translate transdermal sensor data into estimates of BAC. Transdermal sensors will be examined in the context of multimodal research featuring a large and diverse participant sample (N=240) examined both inside and outside the laboratory. The ambulatory arm of the proposed project is aimed at capturing the TAC-BAC relationship across individuals in varying real-world drinking contexts, examining regular drinkers wearing new-generation transdermal sensors in everyday settings while providing prompted breathalyzer readings. This ambulatory research will be complemented by a laboratory study arm, aimed at examining the TAC-BAC relationship among individuals drinking in a controlled setting while alcohol dose and rate of consumption are systematically manipulated. Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network models, will be used to create estimates of BAC from transdermal sensor data. These estimates will be examined in terms of their accuracy, temporal specificity, and also context-dependence. Thus, results will carry significance for addiction science by translating transdermal sensor data and clarifying the place of these sensors in our arsenal of techniques for assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wearable alcohol biosensor might serve health needs across a variety of domains, including aiding in the prevention of alcohol-related disorders, improving interventions for treating problem drinking, and refining outcome assessment in alcohol research. Transdermal sensors represent a uniquely noninvasive and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of alcohol consumption, but data produced by these sensors is highly complex.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV: Ending the HIV Epidemic through interventions and Epidemiology at the intersection of the alcohol and HIV care Continua Established in 2011, the Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV (ARCH) conducts high impact epidemiological and intervention studies that address relationships between at-risk alcohol use and AUD, the HIV Care Continuum (HIV-CC) and health outcomes. ARCH is embedded in and has capitalized on the research and clinical infrastructure of the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), an eight site clinical cohort of university-based HIV clinics across the US, with many of these clinics located in high priority regions for Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). The overarching theme of the proposed P01 is to expand scientific knowledge and treatment interventions at the intersection of the Alcohol-Care Continuum (Alc-CC), HIV-CC and HIV related comorbidities across the full spectrum of alcohol use -- with particular attention to individual context and social determinants of health -- using implementation and epidemiological research. Our scientific goals are: 1) To implement evidence-based alcohol interventions (EBI) across the alcohol use spectrum among PWH using rigorous hybrid-implementation effectiveness designs; 2) To understand how multi-level contextual factors impact the alcohol use spectrum, the Alc-CC and HIV-CC, comorbidities, and intervention responses among PWH; 3) To determine optimal alcohol reduction targets (e.g. abstinence v low-risk drinking, reduction in WHO risk score) among PWH in the context of the Alc-CC, HIV-CC and HIV-related comorbidities. This ARCH P01 has three research projects. We are proposing a Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial integrating alcohol EBIs into HIV clinical care. This study is a direct extension of our earlier research findings demonstrating a robust effect of a computerized brief intervention embedded in a stepped care treatment approach for PWH with at-risk drinking. Our second project is a Hybrid Type1 effectiveness-implementation pilot trial developing and testing a novel relapse prevention intervention (RPI) for PWH. The importance of our focus on RPI is highlighted by our recent finding that any alcohol use among PWH with AUD is associated with increased viremia and the well-established high relapse prevalence of 50 – 75% of persons in remission. Our epidemiological project will provide outcomes data for the intervention trials as well as examine the full spectrum of alcohol use, the Alc-CC and their relationship to HIV-CC, comorbidities and co-infections in the context of social determinants of health. An administrative core provides the structure and processes to support collaboration and synergy across ARCH projects and investigators. A biostatistics and methods core supports analyses for the three projects and development of novel analytic methods. A transdisciplinary group of investigators brings depth and breadth of expertise to this program. Building on a decade of collaborative research progress and administrative structure in ARCH and capitalizing on the extensive resources of CNICS, this P01 proposal addresses issues of high relevance to the US goal of ending the HIV epidemic and the Office of AIDS Research priorities, including HIV Treatment as Prevention, HIV related comorbidities and disparities. At-risk alcohol use, alcohol use disorder and return to drinking can have negative impacts on people with HIV (PWH). We propose to integrate alcohol reduction and relapse prevention interventions into HIV clinical care settings and to study the long-term effects of the spectrum of alcohol use on the alcohol and HIV

"Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of this application is to support and facilitate the necessary training to develop an independent research career focused on examining online and offline social contexts that influence adolescent substance use (SU). In the long-term, the applicant seeks to develop a program of research focused on the use of digital technologies to examine social risk factors that lead to alcohol and drug use among adolescents and to deliver prevention programming. Through the training goals, guided mentorship, and complementary experiences, the proposed project will strategically advance the applicant's knowledge of social media and SU research. The applicant will also be trained in state-of-the-art quantitative methodologies to enhance the design, conduct, and analysis of big data to improve our current understanding of socialization effects on adolescent SU.  The prevention of alcohol and drug use among adolescents remains a critical area for research, as experimentation with alcohol and drug use can lead to long-term negative consequences. In fact, 9 out of 10 people that experience SU problems began using before the age of 18 (CASAColumbia, 2011). While initiation of SU typically occurs during the teenage years, adolescents are also spending a substantial amount of time using social media. Adolescents use social media as a way to connect with a social network, as well as view and display SU behaviors. However, research evaluating the impact of social media on adolescent SU has been understudied, and the available research has several methodological limitations. Namely, prior work has primarily focused on college samples, as well as a less popular social media platform among adolescents (i.e., Facebook). Furthermore, prior work has used self-report data or human coding to assess online SU content. The proposed study seeks to advance the knowledge regarding the role of social media, specifically exposure to SU content, and user-generated e-cigarette content, in the escalation of alcohol and drug use among adolescents.  The proposed project at the center of this training fellowship includes two aims that propose secondary data analyses, and the collection of original data. Aim 1 of the proposed project (n = 243) will use secondary data analyses to determine whether SU attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control mediate the prospective association between exposure to SU-related content posted by peers and influential figures on offline SU behaviors. Aim 2 of the proposed project (n = 200) will prospectively examine the association between online user-generated e-cigarette content on Instagram and offline e-cigarette use using a novel methodological approach. Machine learning algorithms will be developed to detect e-cigarette content on Instagram profiles, and will be compared to self-report data to assess whether the strength of this association varies based on approach. This project will increase knowledge of adolescent SU behaviors that are not visible offline that could uniquely inform prevention programs by identifying modifiable targets for intervention that are relevant for today's youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescent substance use can result in a number of challenges and severe long-term consequences, including academic difficulties, legal problems, the later emergence of a substance use disorder, and injury or death. Social media provides adolescents with opportunities to display and view a variety of substance use behaviors in the absence of negative consequences, and may now represent a key socialization mechanism that has not been widely investigated. The project at the center of this training grant will be the first to assess the influence of exposure to substance use content, by both peers and influential figures, on adolescent substance use, and to identify e-cigarette displays on social media using a machine learning approach.","Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use",10314603,F31DA053003,"['Adolescent Behavior ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socialization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Fostering ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' substance use among youth ', ' youth substance use ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' peer influence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' deter alcohol use ', ' alcohol use prevention ', ' prevent alcohol use ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' Facebook ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,36877
"Brain Function and Neurogenomic influences on AUD risk and resilience. This COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) spinoff application aims to understand structural/functional features in key brain networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), Reward/Salience Network (RSN)) underlying the critical transition from regular drinking to DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in young adult offspring from enriched COGA families, by combining newly ascertained structural, diffusion and functional (s/d/fMRI), Neuropsychological (NPsych) and Electrophysiological (EPhys) data together with existing multimodal longitudinal data (85% with 3+ assessments). The well- characterized, genetically informative COGA sample with many offspring from families densely affected with AUD at higher risk to develop AUD will be moving through the understudied age of young adulthood/early midlife (20's, 30's), when most longitudinal AUD development studies end and when our data predicts that a substantial portion from high density families will transition from regular alcohol use to AUD. This proposal will target 150 young adults (mean age 26) from the COGA study who are current regular drinkers (1/month+ for >6 months, but do not currently meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD), and will follow them longitudinally with a multimodal approach to compare those who transition to DSM-5 AUD and those who do not. We will add s/d/fMRI measures that are not part of the COGA protocol, to provide anatomical specificity to complement current and existing NPsych and EPhys longitudinal data during resting state, and three analogous cognitive/affective tasks [response inhibition (Go/NoGo), reward processing (monetary gambling task), and affect modulation (cognitive/affective Stroop)]. Combining machine learning methods, advanced nonparametric, linear mixed methods, survival model, and joint models of longitudinal data and survival data, we will: (Aim 1) identify features in specific neural circuits (DMN, ECN, RSN) during resting state and during cognitive/affective tasks in young adults who transition from regular drinking to AUD diagnosis from those who do not; (Aim 2) study the effects of drinking behaviors (e.g. age, pattern, duration of alcohol use) on the s/d/fMRI, EPhys, and NPsych features in specific neural circuits associated with the transition to AUD identified in Aim 1; and (Aim 3) determine the role of polygenic risk as measured by polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from alcohol use- and brain-related GWAS, other risk/protective factors [i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, family history, comorbid substance use (nicotine, cannabis), and psychiatric disorders (depression), COVID-related traumatic stress] on neural circuits and their developmental trajectories associated with transitions to AUD identified in Aims 1 and 2. The strength of our diverse, genetically informative, enriched high-risk sample of young adults, longitudinal multimodal measures, and novel integrative analyses will elucidate vulnerabilities and reciprocal relationships among neural circuits, genomic and other risk/protectives factors in the transition to AUD during the 20s and 30s, with utility in prevention and treatment initiatives. This project will address important challenges of understanding deficits in structural and functional brain networks underlying the transition from regular drinking to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) by investigating multidomain measures of brain function—structural/density-weighted/functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (s/d/fMRI) longitudinal electrophysiological (EEG, Event Related Potential/Oscillation (ERP/ERO)) and neurocognitive data in a genetically informative enriched high risk diverse adolescent and young adult prospective study sample, now entering the understudied age of emerging adulthood to midlife. With the use of novel analytic methods to leverage this unique high risk longitudinal multimodal dataset, with data from before and after the initiation of drinking behaviors, this study will elucidate reciprocal relationships among genomic and other risk/protective factors (e.g., COVID-19 related traumatic stress), sex differences and the role of vulnerabilities in neural circuits in the

"Identifying specific genetic pathway interactions for drug use and abuse through integrative omics PROJECT SUMMARY  Cannabis use disorders (CUD) are prevalent in the U.S., and highly comorbid with other substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD), as well as with other mental health problems. While the etiology of cannabis use/misuse have both environmental and genetic components, cannabis use and problematic use are found to be highly heritable. Thus, studies that identify the genetic risk factors for CUD in the general U.S. populations, and in the high-risk populations, are of high public health importance. However, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods are sparse and appear to have only captured a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorder. One key challenge in addiction genetics is how to identify genetic interactions and epistatic regulations that may play a more important role in determining risk for addictive behaviors than what gene variants do individually, and that may help explain a critical part of the missing link. Genetic interactions have rarely been systematically considered in studies of substance use, primarily due to lack of statistical power and shortage of computational methodology. To address the challenge, we propose a framework to systematically detect disease-relevant context specific genetic pathway interactions that underlie the risk for SUD. The framework will be applied to CUD and comorbid AUD to identify crucial genetic interactions and pleiotropic interactions, filling a critical gap in uncovering the genetic architectures of CUD. We will leverage genetic network and pathway topology and integrate multiple layers of omics including genomics, transcriptomic and epigenomic signals in drug abuse relevant tissues. By sharpening the focus on the functionally connected gene and regulation subsets through a priori analyses, we will be able to dramatically boost the statistical power to detect genetic interactions, arrive at highly biologically relevant and readily interpretable findings, and potentially provide clinically actionable insights. The proposed study will utilize outcomes from large GWAS studies for CUD and AUD, together with three high-risk population cohorts with elevated levels of severe cannabis and alcohol use disorders that have whole genome sequence data. We will complement the context specific pathway-level interaction analysis with high-dimensional variable screening machine-learning algorithms to identify both low and high order genetic interactions and regulatory epistatic effects associated with CUD. The findings that are carefully validated using independent study cohorts will be incorporated into a larger disease model of CUD for prediction and potential intervention, and will open up new avenues of research by allowing interrogation of the addiction genetics from a system’s level. The framework will be build in such a way that is readily transferable to other SUD and mental health studies and sets the stage for a genetically and epigenetically informed, precision medicine approach to SUD prevention and treatment. All software developed in the program will be freely available to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the U.S., and frequently co-occur with alcohol and other substance use disorders. The proposed research seeks to identify and determine how key genomic variants and pathways interact with each other in a disease-relevant tissue specific context to affect an individual’s risk for drug abuse. The obtained knowledge will be incorporated into a larger disease model and lead to more precision in the understanding of the mechanism underlying risk for cannabis use disorders and thus provide a substrate for more effective prevention and intervention.",Identifying specific genetic pathway interactions for drug use and abuse through integrative omics,10294110,DP1DA054373,"['Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Prevention ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Regulation ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' alcohol comorbidity ', ' alcohol co-morbidity ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' marijuana use disorder ', ' cannabis use disorder ', ' clinically actionable ', ' marijuana use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' high dimensionality ', ' genetic architecture ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,DP1,2021,532500
"Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease, the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol- induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking. Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming, expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and can be adapted for high-throughput platforms. We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high- throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high- throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair. We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal alcohol exposure is a key factor contributing to abnormal heart development and is associated with various cardiac anomalies with serious long-term complications in adulthood. This study aims to discover novel molecular mechanisms and potential therapies to control the detrimental effect of alcohol exposure on cellular and functional properties of heart cells using human

"Alcohol: A Modifiable Risk Factor for Ataxia and Decline in MCI ABSTRACT The overarching aim of this proposal, which is in response to PA-20-185, asks whether alcohol use exacerbates the motor and cognitive deficits of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (cross-sectionally), and whether drinking accelerates progression of MCI toward dementia (longitudinally). The answers have implications for harm reduction, especially if ""non-hazardous levels"" of alcohol consumption prove to be deleterious to individuals with MCI, in terms of postural stability and risk of falling that can affect activities of daily living and quality of life. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Test cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between drinking rates and static balance and dynamic gait in MCI and control men and women. Hypothesis: Higher rates of alcohol use will be associated with greater instability and slower gait in MCI compared with lower drinking MCI and controls matched in age, sex, and alcohol consumption variables. Hypothesis: At follow-up, accelerated cognitive decline in those with MCI will be predicted by slower natural gait and greater alcohol consumption compared with MCI with faster gait and lower alcohol consumption. Specific Aim 2: Use causal modeling to test multi-factorial determinants of static and dynamic stability metrics: alcohol consumption, sex, sensory physiology, cognitive performance, hematological measures of nutrition, physical and cognitive activities history, and activities of daily living (ADL). Hypothesis: Cross-sectionally, factors related to greater instability in MCI will be greater alcohol consumption, poorer sensory testing, and markers of poorer nutrition. In turn, these biomarkers of compromised function will predict poorer ADLs and quality of life. Hypothesis: Longitudinal measures will confirm cross-sectional relations and identify metrics that track standing instability, gait slowing, poorer ADL, and decline toward dementia with greater alcohol consumption. Specific Aim 3: Identify brain mechanisms of instability factors identified with causal modeling. Hypothesis: Factors related to greater imbalance and gait slowing identified with causal models will be related to smaller and compromised cerebello-pontine-motor cortical nodes and circuitry, whereas factors defining cognitive and mnemonic status will be related to smaller limbic and parietal volumes and diminished integrity of related circuitry. Both the balance and cognitive relations will be mediated by alcohol consumption rates. Hypothesis: Longitudinal analysis will reveal that these relations are enduring. Further, greater rates of alcohol consumption in the testing interim will result in accelerated functional decline in stability, gait speed, and cognitive status and cerebello-pontine-cortical circuitry. Exploratory analysis will use hypothesis-free, data-driven, in-house machine/deep learning methods to seek reliable constellations of factors that predict postural instability, gait impairment, and biomarkers of falling. NARRATIVE The aging of America together with escalating age-related cognitive decline and increasing alcohol drinking in older men and women signals an urgency to investigate the role of alcohol use in exacerbating cognitive decline toward dementia and postural instability as risk for falls attendant morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of this research have the potential to confirm alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for dementia and for standing and walking instability, thereby providing justification for implementing balance, cognitive, and alcohol assessment in treatment settings and for creating protective strategies to enhance postural stability in standing and walking.",Alcohol: A Modifiable Risk Factor for Ataxia and Decline in MCI,10313396,R01AA010723,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Americas ', ' Ataxia ', ' Ataxy ', ' Coordination Impairment ', ' Dyssynergia ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Gait ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Pontine structure ', ' Pons ', ' Pons Cerebelli ', ' Pons Varolii ', ' Pontine ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol level ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' sensory system ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' motor deficit ', ' response ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cerebellopontine ', ' Cognitive ', ' Sensory Physiology ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' cognitive control ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' posture instability ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' Gait speed ', ' deep learning ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' ']",NIAAA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,728816
"Defining Phenotypes of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease with Acute Hepatic Decompensation Project Summary Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach, considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification, and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition. Project Narrative Alcohol-associated liver disease represents a growing public health burden, particularly among younger age groups, women, and ethnic minorities, and is now the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. This project will identify predictors of outcome and improve prognostication in severely ill patients with alcohol- associated liver disease.

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10231194,K08DA051667,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Fostering ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Cannabis ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' brain behavior ', ' alcohol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' brain research ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' endogenous cannabinoid system ', ' eCB system ', ' endocannabinoid system ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' legal marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' cognitive development ', ' marijuana use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' connectome ', ' illicit drug use ', ' early life adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' neural network ', ' connectome based predictive modeling ', ' big-data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,191700
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10212186,R01AA027916,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ', ' alcoholic embryopathy ', ' embryofetal alcohol syndrome ', ' embryopathia alcoholica ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth Disorders ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methylation ', ' Microcephaly ', ' micrencephaly ', ' microencephaly ', ' Parents ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxin ', ' Mediating ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' fetal diagnosis ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' ethanol effect ', ' alcohol effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' ARND ', ' Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Animal Model ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Fetal Alcohol Exposure ', ' Fetal ETOH Exposure ', ' Fetal Ethanol Exposure ', ' In Utero Alcohol Exposure ', ' In Utero ETOH Exposure ', ' In Utero Ethanol Exposure ', ' Prenatal Alcohol Exposure ', ' Prenatal ETOH Exposure ', ' Prenatal Ethanol Exposure ', ' alcohol-exposed pregnancy ', ' exposed to alcohol prenatally ', ' gestation ETOH exposure ', ' gestation alcohol exposure ', ' gestation ethanol exposure ', ' gestational ethanol exposure ', ' pregnancy ETOH exposure ', ' pregnancy alcohol exposure ', ' pregnancy ethanol exposure ', ' prenatally alcohol exposed ', ' prenatally exposed to alcohol ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disability ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ', ' FASD ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' imprint ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,584057
"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes.

"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io?, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ?Lyssn’s? team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ?Lyssn? with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale.

"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical

"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,10147835,R01AA026879,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Individuality ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Psychological Models ', ' Psychologic Models ', ' Morbidity -

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Open bar assay: A novel operant paradigm for examining motivated response and substance abuse in Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individual variation in alcohol preference and self-administration facilitates compulsive alcohol seeking behavior. However, the circuit identity and function underlying individual variability in alcohol self-administration behaviors is still not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to identify subtle behavioral features, fundamental circuitry principles and neurophysiological dynamics underlying alcohol preference in the tractable model system Drosophila melanogaster. Aim 1 will employ a computer vision and machine learning approach to identify subtle behaviors that relate to alcohol preference and alcohol avoidance. In this Aim I hypothesize that animals that express alcohol preference display enhanced seeking behavior, in particular in response to alcohol self- administration whereas lower alcohol preference will manifest through avoidance and reduced locomotion. Aim 2 will employ thermogenetic inactivation, using the GAL4/UAS system, of learning and memory brain circuits we believe play a direct role in encoding alcohol preference. In this Aim I hypothesize that inactivation of our identified learning and memory brain circuits will directly suppress the expression of alcohol preference in flies. Aim 3 will investigate how the neurophysiological dynamics of our identified circuit differs between alcohol preferers and abstainers. I hypothesize that, in my identified circuit, alcohol exposure will result in robust neurophysiological responses in alcohol-preferers and that we will observe the opposite in alcohol abstainers. This work will provide a framework for predicting general circuit principles for escalation of alcohol self- administration in more complex brains, which is in alignment with NIAAA’s mission to support behavioral research on the causes of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innate drug preference has a direct impact on reward- and addiction-related behaviors, and yet how innate drug preference manifests is not well characterized. Here I will examine the behavioral, circuit and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying alcohol preference.

"Neurobehavioral pathways of polygenic and polyenvironmental effects on the onset and maintenance of substance involvement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Problematic substance use is associated with significant personal and socioeconomic costs (accounting for approximately 5% of global disease burden and worldwide deaths). Substance use initiation, progression to heavy use, and early onset substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. This developmental period of risk is theorized to result from typical patterns of regionally asynchronous brain maturation (i.e., rapid and early development of limbic regions alongside relatively immature prefrontal and multimodal association cortices) resulting in a diminished ability to suppress inappropriate emotions, desires, and actions when salient environmental cues are present. During later young adulthood the stabilization, reduction, or desistance of heavy use typically occurs alongside maturing cognitive control and emotional regulation abilities coinciding with cortical development. Brain and behavioral maturation may also be influenced by substance use. As genetic and environmental risk factors for substance involvement are predominantly shared across substances, understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying these shared risk factors in a developmental context will broadly improve our etiologic understanding of substance involvement liability and refine treatment and prevention. In this 5-year R01 (responding to PAR-19- 162), we propose to test whether putative behavioral and neural mechanisms of stage-based addiction may link broad spectrum SUD genomic liability and environmental risk to substance involvement trajectories from childhood – young adulthood using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,875 followed from ages 9-16) along with other samples that uniquely extend the temporal scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use and misuse (e.g., National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence followed 830 individuals from ages 12-32). Disentangling the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying broad spectrum genetic and environmental liability to SUD will inform our etiologic understanding of substance use initiation, escalation, and desistence that may ultimately contribute to substance-related policy, education, nosology, prevention, and treatment. Primary deliverables from this project will be manuscripts evaluating whether behavior and neural phenotypes may represent mechanisms underlying polygenic and polyenvironmental risk for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use often emerges during early adolescence. In some individuals, it progresses to problematic use and use disorder. Liability to develop substance use disorders is shaped by genomic and environmental influences that operate via several mechanisms, including neurobiological pathways associated with behavioral vulnerability. We utilize the ABCD data, along with several other samples that uniquely extend the temporal scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use and misuse.",Neurobehavioral pathways of polygenic and polyenvironmental effects on the onset and maintenance of substance involvement,10317570,R01DA054750,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Siblings ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' association cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Intoxication ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' early onset substance use ', ' early initiation substance use ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' risk sharing ', ' brain behavior ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' early adolescence ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' cognitive development ', ' neural correlate ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' substance misuse ', ' fetal substance exposure ', ' prenatal substance exposure ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,393750
"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,10240574,R01AA027264,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' health science research ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' model design ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' tool development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' trial design ', ' simulation game ', ' simulation-based learning ', ' power analysis ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' online registry ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' treatment research ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,671748
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively.

"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,10124252,R01AA027553,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Names ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Prevention ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk drinking ', ' at-risk drinking ', ' risky drinking ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Alcohol Phenotype ', ' alcoholic phenotype ', ' Abstinence ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' alcohol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' brain research ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' alcohol use initiation ', ' alcohol initiation ', ' drinking initiation ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' Genetic study ', ' predictive tools ', ' connectome ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' imaging study ', ' neural network ', ' connectome based predictive modeling ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426735
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,10132950,R01AA026368,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Physics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol level ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' BrAC ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drinking ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' portability ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' BAC clone ', ' BACs ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' alcohol addiction therapy ', ' alcohol dependence therapy ', ' alcoholism treatment ', ' alcoholism therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' physiologic model ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Plug-in ', ' alcohol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol response ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' population based ', ' data reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,500906
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal AlcoholExposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal AlcoholExposure,10174601,U01AA014809,"['Adult ', '

"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,10125984,K01DA046649,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcoholic Intoxication ', ' Alcohol Intoxication ', ' Drunkenness ', ' EtOH intoxication ', ' ethanol intoxication ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Beverages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Impulsive Behavior ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Cigarette ', ' ethanol effect ', ' alcohol effect ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Boozer ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' discounting ', ' Consumption ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' reward processing ', ' alcohol response ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' therapeutic target ', ' smoking intervention ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' imaging study ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' neural network ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' cigarette craving ', ' ']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,183179
