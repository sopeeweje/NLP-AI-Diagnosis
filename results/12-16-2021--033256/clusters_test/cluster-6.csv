"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time. This paradigm shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality, safety and longevity of pediatric cardiovascular care.",Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm.,10162386,R01HL143468,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Aorta ', ' aortic arch ', ' aorta arch ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computers ', ' Descending aorta ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Safety ', ' Sheep ', ' Ovine ', ' Ovis ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Inferior vena cava structure ', ' Inferior Vena Cava ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' Custom ', ' Computer-Aided Design ', ' Computer-Assisted Design ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Measurement ', ' Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Shapes ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Venous ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Vascular Graft ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Experimental Animal Model ', ' model design ', ' shear stress ', ' Data ', ' Surgical Management ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vascular tissue engineering ', ' engineered vascular tissue ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanofiber ', ' nano fiber ', ' nanofibrous ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' FDA approved ', ' in vitro testing ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Geometry ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' 4D MRI ', ' 4-D MR imaging ', ' 4-D MRI ', ' 4-D flow MR imaging ', ' 4-D flow MRI ', ' 4-D flow imaging ', ' 4-D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4-D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MRI ', ' 4D flow imaging ', ' 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' four dimensional MR imaging ', ' four dimensional MRI ', ' four dimensional flow ', ' four dimensional magnetic resonance imaging ', ' mechanical properties ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' preservation ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' sheep model ', ' ovine animal model ', ' ovine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,643908
"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Savings ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Neurologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' electronic structure ', ' candidate identification ', ' Patient risk ', ' prospective test ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' automated analysis ', ' structured data ', ' learning classifier ', ' magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' MRI/EEG ', ' ']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,10093121,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', '

"Automated Assessment for Robotic Suturing Utilizing Deep Learning Algorithms ABSTRACT Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US at a cost of $20 billion annually. Surgical complications account for a third of these deaths and cost. Surgical performance directly impacts patient outcomes. Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is treated with surgery (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)) that can lead to impotence, incontinence, and even death. Reliable means of objectively assessing technique are required. In this project we will focus on assessing surgeon suturing skills during RARP through virtual reality (VR) simulation. Suturing is a common skill in many types of surgeries, can be tracked with performance metrics, and has been correlated with patient outcomes after RARP. In this proposal we seek to first determine the critical sub-step maneuvers of suturing and the technical skills necessary to achieve them successfully (Aim 1a). Further, we intend to develop an automated skills assessment pipeline through the analysis of raw kinematic data (Aim 1b), video (Aim 2b), and both kinematic/video (Aim 2c), from VR simulation performance by innovative machine learning strategies and deep-learning-based computer vision. The primary differentiator of the proposed work is determining how well granular sub-step maneuvers in suturing are performed. Surgeons participating in this study will not only provide data through their VR simulation performance, but will also contribute real patient data from the RARP to establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and surgical outcomes. Statistical modeling will measure the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient factors to patient outcomes (Aim 3). We hypothesize that innovative application of machine learning algorithms can accurately assess surgeon technical skills, and can further anticipate likelihood of relevant clinical outcomes. The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback in VR, empowering surgeons with valuable knowledge to minimize surgical risk in live surgery.

"Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills Complicated and costly robot assisted surgery (RAS) training results in less frequent use of this technology in several complex areas of surgery, and consequently ends up in harm. RAS requires a unique blend of skills in addition to manual competence with human-machine interaction skills, while operating remotely from patient with no tactile feedback. To address this challenge, numerous studies have focused on simulation-based robotic training curricula, like Fundamental Skills of Robotic Surgery (FSRS), to develop and assess the performance level of the surgeon operator. However, such training tools were developed based on metrics measured by performance on a simulator and other subjectively evaluated metrics. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring. We hypothesize that brain dynamics - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - and eye movement behavior are able to detect change of skill level and the level of surgeon’s performance. To validate this hypothesis, we will record EEG signals and eye movement time series from subjects with different RAS expertise levels. Ten novices, 5 beginners, 5 advanced beginners, and 5 expert surgeons will be included in the study and continuously perform four levels of designed RAS training tasks on surgical robot simulator, dry lab, and animal lab during one year; (1) performing six basic tasks on surgical simulator. All subjects will practice these tasks during two weekly sessions and each practice session takes 2 hours. (2) Subjects will practice 3 tasks of peg transfer, pattern cutting, and suturing on dry lab. (3) Subjects will practice 2 tasks (anastomosis and dissection) on animal tissue and also on plastic models. (4) Subjects will practice two operations of nephrectomy and hysterectomy on animal lab, 2 operations in each session, and each session takes 3 hours and occurs every other week. Two master surgeons will subjectively evaluate performance of subjects (all 25 subjects; Score scale: 1-20) and expertise level (four categories) in performing the designed tasks, every practice session. Master surgeons evaluate surgeon’s skill and performance throughout task and notify change of skill level and performance through time. We will then develop a ‘deep convolutional neural network’ algorithm trained by EEG and eye movement time series through running windows with equal size, to classify subject skill level into four categories of a novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and expert. We will also use network neuroscience techniques to extract engineered features from EEG and eye movement data and use them for training a regression algorithm to develop a model for performance level prediction. Ultimately, the developed objective skill evaluation tool and performance monitoring model will make RAS training more efficient by providing feedback to the trainee regarding his/her skills and directing him/her to focus on skills needed improvement. These improvements will result in more frequent use of RAS in complex surgical areas and ultimately lead to patient safety. Project Narrative The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has offered advantages for surgeons and patients, yet there is no clinically practical tool for objective evaluation of subject’s expertise level and performance. The overall objective of this research is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring, leading to optimized RAS training process, improved patient safety and surgical outcomes.",Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills,10133651,R01EB029398,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Dissection ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Needles ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Surgical sutures ', ' Sutures ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' animal tissue ', ' Individual ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Tactile ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' gaze ', ' Surgeon ', ' Performance ', ' Anastomosis ', ' Anastomosis - action ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' patient safety ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' cost ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' robotic device ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' human disease ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' robotic training ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' adaptive learning ', ' Applied Skills ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' regression algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' algorithm training ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NIBIB,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,385213
"Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors Technological advancements continue to improve surgical outcomes. However, these technologies also introduce new challenges such as communication complexities, equipment troubleshooting under intense pressure, and higher cognitive demand on OR team members. In other words, surgery will continue to be risky despite technological improvements. There is evidence the number of avoidable complications may be underreported, that approximately 39% of in-hospital adverse events are surgical related, and that as many as 4,000 surgical never events (events which should not have occurred) happen in the US each year. The eventual goal of this research is to develop an automated detection system (ADS) of high- risk surgical states. The ADS will prevent surgical safety incidents before they occur through real-time monitoring and notification of appropriate operating room (OR) team members ahead- of-time if there is a looming risk. Thereby allowing the team to reconsider next steps and address the underlying issues, and hence reduce the rates of negative surgical outcomes. This project demonstrates the feasibility and merit of essential components for an ADS. Specifically, the surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, therefore it is likely that a future ADS will model and monitor surgical state through tracking flow disruptions. Our current aims are to (1) finish implementation of the Research & Exploratory Analysis Driven Time-data Visualization (READ-TV) research tool; open-source software to visualize FD patterns and other longitudinal data. (2) Develop a stochastic model to predict whether high-risk, disruptive FD sequences will occur based on FD rates at earlier time points. (3) Link FD patterns and sequences with surgical outcomes by developing a text classifier to identify whether or not a surgical safety incident or near-miss occurred based on the associated EHR note. The classifier will be a deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of surgical EHR notes. The text analysis in the third aim will provide insight to FD types and sequences that are more error prone, thereby revealing the FD patterns that an ADS should warn an OR team to avoid. Additional benefits of this text analysis include a possible confirmation of the existence of incident underreporting. Upon completion of the 3 aims, we will have a computational foundation for an ADS: our research tool (aim 1: READ-TV visualization software) and analyses (aim 3: link flow disruptions to safety incidents through EHR note analysis) will advance interpretation of flow disruption (FD) sequences, and our stochastic models (aim 2: predict future surgical state from FD sequences) will prospectively predict error-prone states. This foundation can be extended in future projects through research in automatic transcription of flow disruptions, and the proper mode of alert delivery if the surgery is prone to enter an error-prone state. Surgery by nature is risky for the patient and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future despite technological advancements. The surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, and we propose that an automated detection system (ADS) can detect if a surgery has an entered a high-risk state through monitoring of FD sequences, thereby alerting the OR team and preemptively preventing a safety incident. As the first steps for such a system: our research visualization tool (Aim 1) will advance interpretation and clustering of FD sequences, our text-based artificial intelligence models (Aim 3) will link FD patterns and surgery characteristics to safety incidents through computational analysis of over 150,000 surgical notes, and our stochastic models (Aim 2) will verify that a high-risk surgical state can be predicted ahead-of-time by monitoring disruption sequences.",Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors,10149122,F31LM013402,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Equipment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surgical Error ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Source Code ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' open source ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' operation ', ' data visualization ', ' Data Science ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' data warehouse ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' deep learning ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,F31,2021,43491
"Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Project Summary/Abstract Patient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability are associated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidney injury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is very important in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment system would predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before a surgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzing an enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur. However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from the physiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently are unavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuous multivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management using state-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data to identify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objective approach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre- op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This data will inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamic instability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that will provide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the key information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute- resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of available surgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying data science in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolution intraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers and researchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditional anesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship, skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training. Project Narrative The proposed training program will enable the applicant to apply generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to widely available pre-operative evaluation notes and data from an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) to improve patient outcomes. The training will comprise the creation of (1) one GAN framework for generating realistic synthetic low-resolution AIMS data from patient profiles in pre- operative evaluation notes and (2) The second GAN framework for generating synthetic high-resolution intraoperative physiological data from low-resolution AIMS data and patient profiles. From this, the applicant aims to (1) investigate the feasibility of using GAN architecture to improve pre-operative risk assessment and (2) create a database for intraoperative high-resolution multivariate time series gathered from both low- resolution AIMS data and pre-operative evaluation notes, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical-decision support system designed to assist anesthesia providers deliver safer care.",Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,10188838,K08GM141489,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Award ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Display ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Intraoperative Complications ', ' Peroperative Complications ', ' intra-operative complication ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Management Information Systems ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Intraoperative Monitoring ', ' intra-operative monitoring ', ' Measures ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Investigator Award ', ' K08 Mechanism ', ' K08 Program ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Process ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' network architecture ', ' Data Science ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' data resource ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preservation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' myocardial injury ', ' injury to the myocardium ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,189794
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,10242118,R44CA112966,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ',

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Predicting the Need for Surgery in Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis using Airway Elastography Derived from Endoscopic OCT and Intraluminal Pressure Measurement Project Abstract  Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is one of the most common life-threatening airway disorders in infants and children. Current treatment methods are based on airway endoscopy, which provides only qualitative information. Surgical treatment failures for the most severe grades of SGS range toward 50%, often due to post-operative airway collapse in new, unpredicted locations. Treatment planning could be improved if evidence-based, quantitative, physiologic or anatomic metrics were available.  To address this need, we propose to advance anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) for high- resolution, high-speed imaging of the airway. Endoscopic aOCT and intraluminal pressure catheters will be used simultaneously to inform models of airway wall viscoelasticity (VE). In combination with simulated surgery and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this constitutes a powerful new clinical tool to predict airway collapse and airflow resistance in children with SGS. Our ultimate goal is to develop an aOCT-informed pipeline to model tissue VE, perform simulated surgery, predict outcomes from a variety of surgical plans and, ultimately, reduce treatment failures. This will leverage existing infrastructure at UNC, including the Virtual Pediatric Airways Workbench for simulated surgery, the Pediatric Airway Atlas of normal airways, and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling of the dynamic interplay between airway wall VE, airway deformation, and intraluminal pressure to accurately model and predict airway collapse.  Our first Aim is to verify that geometric and pressure-related metrics that correlate with whether children receive surgery for SGS, previously established using CT, can be obtained from endoscopic aOCT, thereby avoiding ionizing radiation exposure. Our second Aim is technical development of dynamic (4 dimensional, 4D) aOCT imaging to quantify airway wall VE, validated against CINE CT in pigs. Our final Aim is to create 4D models of the airway in children with SGS including VE properties using aOCT, perform simulated surgery to predict patient-specific post-surgical outcomes, and compare these to post-surgical aOCT models created from routine post-operative surveillance endoscopies. In addition to the development of a new tool, these experiments will also provide new data on longitudinal changes in VE wall properties before and after surgery. Achievement of these goals will provide improved metrics for decision-making and enable evaluation of the dynamic airway without radiation exposure. Our long-term goals are to: 1) validate this approach clinically at multiple institutions; 2) evaluate the ability of these methods to improve outcomes; and 3) use the tool to study other airway diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea (~10% of the population), in children and adults. Public Health Relevance  Our immediate goal is to develop a tool for quantitative, high-speed endoscopy via anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) that eliminates radiation exposure for evaluation of infants and children with subglottic stenosis, a life-threatening upper airway disorder. The tool will be developed as part of an individualized pipeline to model each subject’s airway, simulate surgery, and predict surgical outcomes to better inform surgical decision-making.

One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Selection Bias ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Equation ', ' success ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' high dimensionality ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' random forest ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' underserved community ', ' under served community ', ' surgical disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou- tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively guide diagnosis, sparing patients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort leading to the granting of these codes was focused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of nor- mal tissue. The innovation will be in designing a highly robust (against tissue warping and motion artifacts) and high speed (real-time, seconds) approach for RCM video-mosaicking: we will develop an optical flow ap- proach with a novel hybrid 3-stage deep learning network comprising of 8 parameters that will model global and local rigid and non-rigid tissue motion dynamics, learn and adapt to variable tissue and speckle noise con- ditions in patients, and predict and automatically detect motion blur artifacts. As required by PAR-18-009, our academic-industrial partnership will deliver RCM video-mosaicking to clinicians for real-time implementation at the bedside (translational novelty). Our proposed application is for guiding surgical excision, but the approach will have wider impact, for guiding new and emerging less invasive non-surgical treatments for superficial skin cancers. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated RCM video-mosaicking with real-time speed (125 millisec- onds per frame, 8 frames per second), and registration errors of 1.02 ± 1.3 pixels relative to field-of-view of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking ap- proach and incorporate into a handheld confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with pre-surgical video- mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pa- thology. We are a highly synergistic team from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern Uni- versity, and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.), with a 13-year record of collaboration. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers, and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We propose to develop an approach to noninvasively delineate skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,10203886,R01CA240771,"['Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', "" Hutchinson's Melanotic Freckle "", ' Lentigo Maligna ', ' Lentigo Maligna Melanoma ', ' Malignant Lentigo ', ' Malignant Lentigo Melanoma ', ' Melanotic Freckle ', ' Microscope ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Video Microscopy ', ' Videomicrography ', ' Videomicroscopy ', ' Dermatologist ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Ablation ', ' Surgeon ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer ', ' nonmelanoma skin cancer ', ' Skin Carcinoma ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' in vivo ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' blind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical practice ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning network ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' prospective test ', ' human imaging ', ' reflectance confocal microscopy ', ' in vivo confocal microscopy ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,641977
"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,10296166,R01EB005807,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Aviation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Floor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Israel ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manikins ', ' Mannequins ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Perioperative Nursing ', ' OR nurse ', ' OR nursing ', ' Surgical Nursing ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy ', ' Celioscopic Cholecystectomy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Discipline ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures ', ' Minimal Access Surgical Procedures ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' instructor ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' eye/hand coordination ', ' hand and eye coordination ', ' hand/eye coordination ', ' eye hand coordination ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Effectiveness ', ' distraction ', ' Board Certification ', ' Interruption ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' cognitive training ', ' healing ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' interactive computing ', ' computer generated ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cognitive skill ', ' Software Framework ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' virtual surgery ', ' Surgical Simulation ', ' virtual reality surgery ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual environment ', ' head mounted display ', ' head mounted device ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' simulation environment ', ' virtual patient ', ' ']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654073
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,10158551,R01NS110347,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrocoagulation ', ' Electrocautery ', ' Endocavitary Fulguration ', ' Fulguration ', ' Galvanocautery ', ' Surgical Diathermy ', ' Thermocoagulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' millimeter ', ' Severities ', ' Contralateral ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Anterior Temporal Lobectomy ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' tractography ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,938092
"Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY In surgery, it is accepted that there may be a ten to twenty-year learning curve to reach mastery for certain procedures. We believe this timeline can and should be shortened to improve patient care. Our short-term goal is to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by building a database of mastery level surgical performance and generating a roadmap for multimodal data collection and analysis procedures. Sharing our process, procedures and results broadly, will help to change measurement culture in healthcare. Through our newly developed partnership (October 2019) with the American College of Surgeons, we have already experienced early success in starting the conversation through the “Surgical Metrics Project” (https://www.facs.org/education/surgical-metrics). Using a standardized data collection platform (a mastery-level hernia simulation), we will deploy and synchronize multiple data capture approaches (motion tracking, video, audio and validated surgical performance checklists) to build our database. Data analysis will quantify surgical mastery and consist of new applications and discoveries in machine learning. Hypothesis: Using multiple, synchronized data capture approaches and machine learning, it is possible to create a database of mastery level surgical strategies that can be translated into a value-added, surgical navigation tool for surgeons. To test this hypothesis, we will empirically investigate the following paraphrased aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Quantify surgical mastery (cognitive and technical) during a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair by using a post-procedure analysis of multi-modal performance metrics captured from hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish validity evidence for surgical mastery metrics by comparing simulation-based LVH performance with operating room LVH performance from the same surgeons (N~60). SPECIFIC AIM 3: Empirically investigate the best implementation strategy for utilization of a surgical navigation tool designed to deliver value-added information regarding mastery-level surgical performance strategies to a new group of hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125).

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital

"Development of a commercially viable machine learning product to automatically detect rotator cuff muscle pathology PROJECT SUMMARY Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations, and therefore remain a very challenging clinical problem. Roughly 20% to 50% of those 60 years of age have a known rotator cuff tear and the prevalence only increases with age. While surgical reconstruction of the rotator cuff seeks to improve shoulder function and stability, the degrees of successful surgical outcomes vary significantly. These widely differing outcomes are because, pre-operatively, it is difficult under current evaluative methods to predict which patients will benefit from surgery versus those who will not. The focus of this project is to develop unique technology that replaces current methods to produce a rapid, accurate assessment of rotator cuffs capable of large-scale commercial deployment. From a clinical perspective, there is significant scientific evidence that excessive fat infiltration and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles lead to poor outcomes because the presence of fatty tissue limits the ability for the muscle to recover and regenerate following tendon reconstruction. While current clinical practice utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate fat infiltration in the rotator cuff using qualitative scoring systems, previous studies have established that qualitative scoring has a relatively low correlation with quantitative measures of fat infiltration and atrophy. Incorporating quantitative measurements would dramatically improve clinical treatment decision-making. However, such evaluation under existing methods would require substantial manual input and thus is not clinically viable. A fast and accurate method for segmenting the rotator cuff muscles and quantifying fat infiltration is essential for improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary surgeries. This proposal aims to leverage Springbok’s previous technological innovations in machine learning image segmentation to develop an algorithm capable of fast, accurate assessment of rotator cuff muscle atrophy quantification and fat infiltration. The algorithm will be developed so that it can ultimately be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow, thereby not requiring any additional clinician time, and in fact is likely to materially reduce that time. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep-learning-based automatic algorithm for quantification of rotator cuff muscle volumes and fatty infiltration. In Aim 2, we will develop a software prototype to incorporate the algorithm into clinical workflow to support the decision-making process. Completion of this Phase 1 project will lead to a prototype product that is ready for beta-testing during Phase II at multiple Orthopaedic centers, enabling a 510(k) application for market clearance. This project will significantly improve the accuracy of shoulder pathology assessments, thus advancing the diagnosis and treatment of shoulder pathologies, improving the outcomes of costly Orthopaedic procedures, and potentially even eliminating unnecessary procedures, all of which will improve patient care and lower the associated costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations such that clinicians need innovative tools to better determine who could benefit from surgical repair.

"Aligning Patient Acuity with Intensity of Care after Surgery ABSTRACT A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate with the training and resources necessary to develop expertise and experience in large-scale, multi-institutional informatics research using electronic health record data and machine learning to develop clinical decision-support tools. This proposal builds toward the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist with expertise in design and implementation of machine learning systems to augment clinical decision-making. To accomplish this goal, the candidate and mentors propose a systematic investigation of postoperative ‘patient acuity’ (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and ‘intensity of care’ (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory measurements). After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity and intensity of care can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use, affecting approximately 15 million inpatient surgeries annually in the US alone. When high-acuity patients receive low-intensity care, postoperative complications can progress to critical illness and cardiac arrest. Providing high-intensity care to low-acuity patients has low value and may cause harm through unnecessary treatments. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying ‘intensity of care’ definition. The overall objective of this application is to understand intensity of care decision spaces in surgical patients and match them to clinical phenotypes and outcomes, leveraging this knowledge to generate precise, autonomous decision-support tools. The central hypothesis of this application is that inappropriate postoperative intensity of care is common, predictable, and associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, morbidity, and hospital costs. The rationale for this work is that integrating electronic health record data, machine learning, and clinical domain expertise offers opportunities to understand postoperative intensity of care decisions and develop decision-support tools capable of optimizing clinical outcomes and resource use. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) develop and validate postoperative intensity of care definitions, (2) develop and validate interpretable, actionable acuity assessments that elucidate decision spaces, and (3) identify and predict postoperative intensity of care phenotypes. The proposed research is significant because it addresses a problem that affects millions of patients annually and is associated with potentially preventable harm and suboptimal resource use. The approach is innovative because the candidate and mentors are unaware of any prior attempts to classify and adjudicate postoperative intensity of care and understand the phenotypes and characteristics of patients receiving insufficient or excessive care. During the award period, the candidate will apply for an NIH-R01 investigator-initiated award for the prospective clinical implementation of an interpretable, actionable decision support tool incorporating validated intensity of care definitions and knowledge garnered from phenotype clustering, initially in a silent data collection period followed by a live period during which clinicians are provided with model outputs and clinically actionable recommendations. NARRATIVE After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and intensity of care (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory test monitoring) can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying definition of intensity of care.

"A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY We aim to reduce surgical robotic errors by developing novel technology to coach experienced practitioners by using real-time data-driven predictive models of operator behavior, task difﬁculty, and expertise levels during complex surgical training tasks. This technology could increase the effectiveness of simulation-based training, particularly for practicing clinicians, as the predictive models will inform the design of adaptive and personalized feedback for the surgeon.  Surgical training typically involves didactic learning, skills labs, and practice on live patients. Safety concerns asso- ciated with training on patients has led to signiﬁcant developments in simulation-based technology; however, existing simulators may lack the ability promote mastery of skills for practicing providers. Improved training is important for both the provider and the patient. An estimated 100,000 death per year occur due to preventable medical errors. In robotic surgeries, the majority of patient injuries can be attributed to inexperience and lack of technical competence of the attending surgeon. These errors could potentially be avoided through personalized and adaptive coaching.  In general, robotic systems can sense and adapt to their environment, even act autonomously to complete a task. However, the majority of surgical robots used today are “teleoperated systems"". These systems only perform tasks directly commanded by the human operator, possibly with some scaling or tremor cancellation. There is a missed opportunity to leverage the intelligence of robotic systems to sense and interpret the movements of the surgeon and to enable some form of adaptive feedback for personalized coaching. Our prior work in human-centric modeling could hold the key to the technical challenge of integrating intelligent methods into existing surgical robotic training platforms by better understanding the technical strengths and weaknesses of the practicing surgeon in a data-driven manner.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve surgical training outcomes by developing a personalized and adaptive surgical robotic coach capable of providing meaningful feedback to the practicing provider to optimize learning and skill transfer. The speciﬁc aims of the proposal include: (1) evaluate the ability of human- centric models to characterize surgeon performance using motion and video data, (2) design adaptive haptic or visual guidance cues to provide learners with real-time feedback and to optimize learning, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive technology coach through end-user validation using procedural-speciﬁc training models for general surgery, urology, and gynecologic oncology. This project could signiﬁcantly improve provider training in robotic surgery. The project could also improve provider training for laparoscopic and open surgery as the models used to develop the virtual coach are inherently human-centric and not tied to any speciﬁc surgical tasks or surgical platforms.  Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success in this project, bringing together experts in surgical robotics, human-centric modeling, machine learning, and advanced surgical training. We have conducted extensive preliminary studies in areas related to this proposal, supporting feasibility of this project. Our integration with the Simulation Center at UTSW will enable translation of successful outcomes of this project into the surgical training and retraining pipeline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human-generated, preventable errors, particularly those made intra-operatively, can lead to morbidity and mortality for the patient and high costs for the hospital. While simple inanimate trainers have been successfully developed for surgical resident education, there is a lack of simulation-based technology for practicing surgeons. This research leverages novel data-driven methods to quantify how, and how well, a surgeon is performing a task for the long-term goal of developing personalized, adaptive virtual coaches for surgical robotic systems, resulting in better patient outcomes.",A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance,10265456,R01EB030125,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Credentialing ', ' Cues ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Rotation ', ' Safety ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Surgical Error ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Urinary Diversion ', ' Urology ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Shapes ', ' Robot ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Tactile ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual feedback ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Surgical Models ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' haptics ', ' emotional factor ', ' public health relevance ', ' robotic training ', ' Transferable Skills ', ' Learning Skill ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' robotic system ', ' haptic feedback ', ' virtual coach ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,308003
"Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and post-surgical outcome: An ENIGMA-Epilepsy initiative ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients do not respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and require additional diagnostic work-up, including consideration for surgery. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that co-localize with the seizure focus. However, up to 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number is growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle brain network abnormalities that could help to delineate the epileptogenic network and aid in the prediction of treatment response (i.e., response to ASMs and surgical outcomes). Unfortunately, methods for reliably identifying which patients will be drug-responsive versus drug- resistant, and which patients will achieve successful versus unsuccessful surgical outcomes are lacking.  A major barrier to progress in this field has been obtaining quantitative imaging, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dMRI), clinical, and genetic data on large, geographically diverse samples of patients in whom different treatment outcomes can be evaluated. In the past, sample sizes have been insufficient to detect subtle, but reliable, brain abnormalities in patients with focal or generalized epilepsies that are genuinely associated with epilepsy and not with vicissitudes related to small or geographically restricted samples.  A new, large-scale data initiative, ENIGMA4-Epilepsy, coupled with technological advancements that enable improved data harmonization are now lifting these barriers and allowing us to combine multi-site sMRI/dMRI, clinical, genetic data to predict important clinical outcomes, and making the results generalizable to a global epilepsy community. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a consortium of 24 epilepsy centers from 14 countries (more than 2,250 patient and 1,727 healthy control sMRI/dMRI datasets) and the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP). We will include new network models (i.e., individualized connectomes) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test whether a combination of imaging, clinical, and genetic risk can accurately predict two clinical outcomes: drug-resistance and post-operative seizure outcome. Our scientific premise is that MRI-based assessment of whole-brain network properties, in combination with clinical data and PRS derived from genetic data, are able to predict (i) drug response in recently diagnosed epilepsy cases and (ii) postsurgical outcomes in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy.  This R01 addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly-powered design capable of capturing variability across patients with diverse clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. This grant is also directly aligned with NINDS's 2020 Epilepsy Benchmarks (IIIB), which encourage the identification of genetic, clinical, and imaging biomarkers capable of predicting treatment response in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting over 50 million people world-wide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how quantitative, non-invasive neuroimaging, clinical and genetic data can be used to predict (1) which patients will respond to anti-seizure medications versus which will remain drug-resistant and (2) which patients will achieve favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying a series of hypothesis-driven and data- driven (i.e., machine learning) approaches to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with common epilepsy syndromes, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",10086996,R01HL144692,"['clinical risk ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' data streams ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' simulation environment ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Insufflation ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intraoperative Care ', ' Peroperative Care ', ' intra-operative care ', ' Intraoperative Period ', ' intra-operative period ', ' Intubation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' mortality ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' pressure ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preconditioning ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' information display ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' data structure ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,734363
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,10197880,R01DE027251,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Bone Regeneration ', ' bone repair ', ' regenerate bone ', ' Bone Transplantation ', ' Bone Grafting ', ' bone transplant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cephalometry ', ' head measurement ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Jaw ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Orthodontics ', ' Osteotomy ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Syndrome ', ' Talents ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' skull base ', ' Basicranium ', ' Basis cranii ', ' Cranial Base ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' soft tissue ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' Complex ', ' Autologous ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' craniomaxillofacial ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' user-friendly ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' usability ', ' standard of care ', ' operation ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Formulation ', ' virtual surgery ', ' Surgical Simulation ', ' virtual reality surgery ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' virtual reality simulator ', ' virtual simulator ', ' ']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,574725
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' capsule ', ' Capsules ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymphatic nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' lymphnodes ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity -

"Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK) PROJECT SUMMARY  Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes, utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep- learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).  DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However, the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively. In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.  Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO- DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely. The tool will be built on a handheld platform that will consist of CP-OCT probe, trephine and microinjector that allows precise and safe removal of the anterior section of cornea down to DM  We hypothesize that AI-OCT providing intelligent visualization and depth controlled optimal cornea cutting and tissue tracking will perform the task of DALK with better accuracy and efficiency over the manually performed trephine cutting and “Big Bubble” pneumodissection. Project Narrative  This proposal addresses fundamental limitations in current corneal transplant surgery by developing an artificial intelligence guided compact robotic surgical tool that could empower corneal surgeons to achieve difficult surgical objectives, reduce intraoperative complications, and improve clinical outcomes when performing Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK). Further, these capabilities are broadly applicable in other microsurgical problems, and the tools will enable further advances both for ophthalmology and for other microsurgical disciplines.",Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK),10100636,R01EY032127,"['Transplantation Surgery ', ' Visualization ', ' iatrogenic injury ', ' iatrogenic damage ', ' Accounting ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cadaver ', ' Complication ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Corneal dystrophy ', ' Corneal Opacity ', ' Leukoma ', ' cornea opacity ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' corneal transplant ', "" Descemet's membrane "", ' Lamina Elastica Posterior ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Endophthalmitis ', ' Ophthalmia ', ' Endothelium ', ' Engineering ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fiber Optics ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intraoperative Complications ', ' Peroperative Complications ', ' intra-operative complication ', ' Iris ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Lamellar Keratoplasty ', ' Penetrating Keratoplasty ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Needles ', ' Ocular Hypertension ', ' ocular hypertensive ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Ptosis ', ' Procidentia ', ' Prolapse ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Rabbits ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Reoperation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Burr hole procedure ', ' Trephining ', ' Trephinings ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Epithelial ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Recovery ', ' Topical Corticosteroids ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' cicatrix corneal ', ' corneal fibrosis ', ' corneal scar ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Perforation ', ' Surgeon ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' phantom model ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Drops ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' photonics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Eye Surgeon ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Trauma ', ' graft failure ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Systems Development ', ' Geometry ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' Injections ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409997
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance Project Summary Post-surgical complications (PSCs) have been an increasing concern for hospitals, particularly in light of payment reform focusing on longer episodes and Medicare penalties for 30-day readmissions and adverse outcomes including deep or organ space surgical site infections (DOS-SSIs). Readmission due to post- discharge complications in particular has become a target for quality improvement since many of these events are considered preventable. The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to a number of clinical risk models for PSCs. These modeling efforts have primarily been targeted at the surgical specialty areas within which a large number of events occur (such as colorectal surgery) as well as applying sophisticated statistical modeling / machine learning to allow for missing data, interactions, and nonlinearities. However, there is still considerable room for improvement both in terms of accuracy and generalizability. In our current funding period, we have demonstrated the predictive value of clinical notes for PSCs. However, one glaring limitation of current models is that they are trained on high volume surgical specialties at large tertiary care institutions with high quality clinical data and use of advanced informatics approaches. The impetus of this proposal is essentially two-fold: (i) Accurate models can be created for lower volume institutions and specialties via transfer learning and leveraging more data via unconfirmed outcomes (i.e., those that mimic gold standard outcomes, but are less reliable) with proper accounting of reliability. (ii) Decision making can be significantly improved by leveraging time varying, real-time data such as labs, vitals, and clinical notes to provide the current risk of PSCs for patients using all information as it becomes available. We aim to i) develop and apply longitudinal risk models for PSCs to explicitly account for the time varying nature of some of the information (e.g., labs, vitals, clinical notes) as it becomes available in real-time so that it can be integrated into the clinician’s decision making; ii) develop and apply transfer learning to PSC risk models; iii) develop modeling approaches that allow for the use of more widely available unconfirmed outcomes, while explicitly accounting for the additional uncertainty and bias due to the use of such unconfirmed outcomes when compared to a less available gold standard; and iv) develop a widely applicable framework for model evaluation and monitoring. Models will often not perform in practice as they do in research for a variety of reasons. This framework will allow us to identify these issues and more efficiently translate and apply these complex predictive models into practice so that the research can have an immediate clinical impact. Successful development would open the door for next generation patient monitoring, alerts, and interventions for all surgical specialties and all institutions. We will make the relevant modeling results publicly available so that lower volume institutions can leverage the transfer learning approach developed here without the need for our actual data. This will ultimately lead to improved patient care and lower overall cost by identifying complications early and limiting readmission due to PSCs at Mayo Clinic and other institutions across the nation. Narrative Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EHRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EHRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EHRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,10202598,R01EB019403,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Colorectal Surgery ', ' Colon and Rectal Surgery ', ' colon and rectum surgery ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Wound Infection ', ' surgical site infection ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Glare ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' clinical risk ', ' genetic information ', ' Data Science ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' unstructured data ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,630812
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. The proposed research has the potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring of numerous hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale.",Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections,10186798,K08HS025776,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,160142
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,10134456,R01NS112816,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Generalized Epilepsy ', ' Generalized Seizure Disorder ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Change ', ' base ', ' brain surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' stem ', ' standard measure ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442761
"SCH: INT: A Virtual Surgery Simulator to Accelerate Medical Training in Cardiovascular Disease The objective of the parent proposal is to devise and deploy an integrated virtual surgery simulator to transform training and surgical planning in cardiovascular medicine. By advancing science in graphics, visualization and real-time simulations, and interfacing with virtual reality (VR) technology, we will offer clinical trainees insight into cardiac physiology and pathology, accelerating knowledge acquisition and intuition-building in ways not possible with current tools. Despite recent advances in cardiovascular patient-specific modeling and blood flow simulation, current virtual surgery capabilities are limited to cumbersome by-hand model manipulations and blood flow simulations run on high-performance computing clusters for days at a time. These complexities preclude hands- on use by clinicians and often limit the models to a small cohort of anatomic designs. To drive this technology, the parent proposal contained the following specific aims: 1) Develop computer-graphics tools for efficient model manipulation, 2) Integrate reduced-order modeling with visualization to create a real-time interactive experience, and 3) Develop and deploy an interactive VR educational environment for medical students and clinical trainees. In support of these efforts, in this supplement proposal we will ready the Vascular Model Repository (VMR) for use in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine / deep learning (ML/DL) applications. The VMR is an open database of medical image data, segmented vascular models, and blood flow simulation results developed with support from the National Library of Medicine. We will use the VMR to support two major AI/ML efforts in the community. First, we will greatly accelerate anatomic model construction by DL for image segmentation, overcoming a major bottle neck to studies with large cohorts of patients. Second, we will develop physics-informed ML methods to drastically reduce current lengthy simulation times and provide fast and interactive feedback for surgical and interventional planning. This will produce fast and deployable ``digital twins'' that can provide interactive feedback to clinicians; these methods will be in direct support of the parent proposal and of general interest to the field. The supplement proposal contains three specific aims: 1) To ready the VMR for AI/ML by users who are not domain experts and spark interest in cardiovascular applications in the ML community, 2) To run community challenges in image segmentation and physics-informed ML at a major international meeting to identify best in class ML/DL methods, and 3) To demonstrate ML/DL methods in interactive surgical planning applications by integrating efforts with the parent proposal. We will disseminate our findings, methods, data, and source code to the research community via the open source SimVascular software project and the open data VMR. Our team brings together expertise in cardiovascular biomechanics and finite element modeling, computer graphics and reduced order modeling, physics informed ML, and development of open source and open data resources for the scientific community. The parent proposal aims to create an integrated virtual surgery simulator to transform training and surgical planning in cardiovascular medicine, overcoming limitations of current methods that require cumbersome by-hand model manipulations and expensive simulations. To achieve this, we will integrate advancements in computer graphics, fast reduced order models and virtual reality tools designed to foster education.

"Breast-conserving surgery resection margin assessment using optical light active line scanning The rate of re-excision procedures to remove residual tumor left behind after initial resection is high in cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) due to the limited intraoperative tools available to the surgeon. The gold standard for BCS specimen margin assessment is histopathological analysis, which is post- operative in nature and can take hours to days to complete. The development of intraoperative margin assessment technology to help the surgeon effectively resect the entire breast tumor during the initial BCS is of paramount importance to reduce patient morbidity, patient disfigurement, and healthcare costs associated with BCS re-excisions.  The primary objective of the proposed research project is to further develop a new form of optical imaging, sub-diffuse line scanning (SDLS), to evaluate its value for intraoperative assessment of BCS specimen margins. The first aim is to develop an optimized SDLS system. This aim involves hardware improvements to increase the speed of scanning, enable multi-wavelength acquisition, mitigate specular reflection artifacts, and provide high spatial resolution images. The second aim is to collect SDLS image data of BCS specimens in two phases: first, post-operatively in parallel with standard of care pathological processing, and second, intraoperatively, immediately after excision. In the first phase, line scans will be collected from individual bread loaf slices from each BCS specimen. The image data will be conservatively co-registered with histopathology with guidance from an expert pathologist. In the second phase, line scans of freshly excised, whole specimens will demonstrate the ability to image actual intact BCS specimen margins using SDLS. The third aim is to train a margin classification model using radiomic image features extracted from confirmed tissue subtype regions in the phase 1 bread loaf slice images. The model will be tested on the intraoperative phase 2 images of actual BCS specimen margins. The optimized SDLS system, coupled with the classification model, could eventually be translated into a prospective clinical trial to assess its performance as an intraoperative margin assessment tool.  The proposed fellowship training plan involves broadening technical expertise in optical system design, compressive sensing, multivariate data analysis, and machine learning, and includes clinical experiences in breast tissue pathology, radiology, and surgery. Professional development activities include formal presentations to biomedical imaging and clinical audiences, grant writing workshops and R01 grant writing experience, undergraduate mentoring, and teaching. The training plan incorporates publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts from the proposed research. Fellowship sponsors and collaborators are experts with specific expertise in surgery, breast pathology, radiology, biomedical optics, machine learning, and biomedical engineering. The applicant will work closely with the mentoring team to accomplish the aims of the project and to continue developing into an independent, productive, and impactful researcher in biomedical optics and cancer research.

"Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients,9944685,R01NS104116,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,COOK CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,428636
"Data-Driven Framework for Classification and Surgical Planning of Spinal Deformity. PROJECT SUMMARY Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) impacts 2-4% of the adolescent population. AIS causes a three- dimensional deformity of the spinal column affecting the patients’ normal motion and posture and may cause lung and heart dysfunction, early onset osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration if left untreated. Spinal fusion surgery in progressive cases of scoliosis remains the main treatment option. The variation in patients’ pre-operative characteristics, the surgical implants, and the surgical maneuvers have resulted in a wide range of surgical outcomes, 20% of which remains to be less than satisfactory. As the suboptimal surgical outcomes can significantly impact the cost, risk of revision surgery, and long-term rehabilitation of the adolescent patients, objective patient-specific models that can predict the outcome of different surgical treatment scenarios and determine the optimal surgical intervention for individuals are of critical need. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that identifying the key features of a 3D spinal curve before the operation and the intraoperative surgical interventions the influence the long-term outcomes can provide a quantitative framework for predicting the surgical outcomes in this patient population. To this end, we propose (i) to identify the patient-specific and surgeon modifiable predictors of the spinal fusion outcomes in an in-house database of surgical AIS patients using machine learning, (ii) to develop a probabilistic predictive model of the outcomes as a function of pre-operative patient condition and the surgical interventions and (iii) to develop a fully automated framework that allows online image processing and assigns a treatment option that probabilistically determines the surgical outcome for a new patient based on a prior learning algorithm. The innovation of this approach is in developing the first data-driven predictive model for surgical planning of AIS patients that allows comparing different treatment scenarios through a probabilistic predictive framework and recommending surgical intervention that leads to an optimal outcome for a given patient. This knowledge-based algorithm automatically extracts the spinal curve patterns from the medical images as a classifier. The exploitation of an automated image processing algorithm to develop a reduced ordered model of the spinal deformity allows a fast quantitative analysis appropriate for direct clinical dissemination. It is aimed to use this model as an assistive tool for personalized surgical decision making of the AIS patients in the clinical setups. This assistive tool, which will be trained and tested using a large database of the medical images of the AIS patients, can make significant contribution to the field by developing a quantitative approach that considers a combinations of surgical methods and provides recommendations to achieve an improved outcome of the spinal deformity surgery in the pediatric population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe spinal deformity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) requires surgical fusion of the spinal column in order to correct and stabilize the spine. Variations in the spinal deformity manifestation and treatment strategies have challenged the outcome prediction of the surgical intervention in this patient population, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes in 20% of the surgically treated AIS patients.

"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10254332,R01HS027417,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,395050
"Novel DWI Methods to Minimize Postoperative Deficits in Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery. Project Summary/Abstract For the millions of epilepsy patients with drug-resistant seizures, surgical resection of epileptogenic brain tissue is often the only remaining therapeutic option. Especially in young patients who do not obtain seizure control or suffer from unacceptable side effects from medications, there are further concerns about the effect of seizures on development: even brief but repetitive seizures cause cognitive regression and detrimental psychosocial effects. This motivates a particular urgency to investigate a more structured, quantitative, and non-invasive tool, which is capable of informing families and providers to decide timely surgery by accurately providing the probabilities of both favorable and unfavorable postoperative outcomes using data from preoperative imaging analysis at the whole-brain level. The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel tool of benefit-risk analysis for the presurgical evaluation of pediatric drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Toward this goal, we will validate a state- of-the-art deep learning-based diffusion MRI technique to provide the resection margin (i.e., the distance between epileptogenic area and eloquent area) resulting in maximized benefits (i.e., seizure freedom and long- term neurocognitive improvement) and minimized risk (i.e., deficits in eloquent functions including motor/language/hearing/vision). With NIH support, we have established diffusion-weighted imaging maximum a posteriori probability (DWI-MAP) analysis with Kalman filter, which can provide individual patients with the optimal resection margin, yielding successful avoidance of motor/language/visual deficits in 93%/91%/90% of patients with ≥75% of patients benefiting from seizure freedom. Recently, we have also found that deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can provide an excellent accuracy (94-100%) to classify true positive tracts of eloquent brain areas, suggesting that DCNN-based tract classification may outperform the DWI-MAP in detecting diverse function-specific white matter pathways. Aim 1 of this project will investigate if a combination of DCNN-based tract classification with Kalman filter even better predicts the resection margin, resulting in seizure freedom and avoidance of functional deficits at a large cohort. Aim 2 will investigate if an advanced DWI approach integrating DCNN and DWI connectome helps decide timely surgery by providing 1) preoperative imaging markers underlying high likelihood of postoperative neurocognitive improvements and 2) mechanistic insight in structural brain reorganization associated with postoperative verbal IQ improvement. The results of this project are expected to ultimately improve clinical management of pediatric epilepsy by translating deep learning- based diffusion MRI technique to optimize the surgical margin, predict the postoperative neurocognitive outcome, and determine specific mechanism of postoperative brain reorganization, which will be validated for optimizing clinical benefit-risk analysis before surgical intervention. Project Narrative In this renewal application, we will investigate a novel tool of benefit-risk analysis for the presurgical evaluation of pediatric drug-resistant focal epilepsy which utilizes the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based tract classification to provide an optimal resection boundary of the epileptogenic area resulting in the maximized benefit (seizure freedom) and minimized risk (functional deficit including motor, language, hearing, and vision). We will also study if the integration of DCNN and DWI connectome helps decide timely surgery by providing preoperative imaging markers underlying a high likelihood of postoperative neurocognitive improvements and mechanistic insight in structural brain reorganization associated with postoperative verbal IQ improvement.

"Data Driven Approaches to Improving Risk Prediction of Pulmonary Complications After Major Inpatient Surgery ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common and major drivers of morbidity and mortality after major inpatient surgery. Various risk prediction scores identify patients at high risk of developing PPCs and observational research has connected peri-operative care practices with subsequent risk. However, anesthesia providers do not have patient specific evidence based interventions to prevent pulmonary complications. RESEARCH: The proposed research will draw on a wealth of perioperative information available to identify the interactions of patient, procedure and process of care factors which place patients at risk of PPCs. This will incorporate advances in data science to the pre-operative prediction of PPCs (Aim 1). We will then revise and improve this estimate in light of the high fidelity intraoperative data stream from ventilators, monitors and patient response to real life decisions being made during the delivery of anesthesia care (Aim 2). This will allow understanding of what features most contributed to patient specific risk (Aim 3). The proposed research and training will provide Dr Colquhoun with the skills in data science to his transition to an independent researcher. CANDIDATE: Dr Douglas A Colquhoun is a tenure track Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Michigan. He is board certified in Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and maintains an active clinical practice in the perioperative care of patients undergoing major surgery. During a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr Colquhoun developed expertise in the derivation of outcomes and processes of care from electronic medical record data. His long term career goal is to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications by offering anesthesia providers data driven strategies for management delivered at the point of care. ENVIRONMENT: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) an international consortium of 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Colquhoun, and is the Director for MPOG. Dr Kheterpal and the Department of Anesthesiology have a rich history of developing and deploying innovative software solutions to address problems in perioperative medicine and research. Dr Colquhoun will additionally be advised from expert co-mentors drawn from across the institution and a scientific advisory panel expert in the prevention and management of postoperative complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postoperative Pulmonary Complications are common, costly and drivers of major inpatient morbidity. While risk models predict patients who may be at risk, few evidenced based management strategies exist, this approach has not been updated in light of the wealth of EHR derived data now available in contemporary practice.

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients.

"Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi- center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gauging electrical properties of surgical margins during tumor resection procedures has the potential to alert surgeons to regions of cancer not fully extracted and subsequently reduce the number of positive surgical margins which are significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. The intraoperative electrical property sensing/imaging probe and the visualization tools proposed here will provide an accurate, rapid, and cost- effective method for gauging these surgical margins for multiple cancer types. We will explore this technology in the context of prostate cancer surgery with the expectation that this will further advance the study of electrical property signatures of normal and diseased tissue in vivo and help to translate this technology to the clinic.",Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment,10218115,R01CA237654,"['Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Elements ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Urethra ', ' urethral ', ' Work ', ' Salvage Therapy ', ' Salvage-Tx ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' prostate surgery ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Left ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' urinary bladder neck ', ' Bladder Neck ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Erectile dysfunction ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Hormonal ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' electrical property ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' expectation ', ' Devices ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Radiation ', ' Property ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer surgery ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' in vivo ', ' Periprostatic ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Pathologic ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' imaging probe ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Imaging technology ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' data acquisition ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' feasibility trial ', ' electrical impedance tomography ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,478142
"A ROBOT-ASSISTED PERFUSION SYSTEM TO IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY IN THE CARDIAC OPERATING ROOM PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The vast majority of pediatric and adult cardiac surgery procedures worldwide involve the use of cardiopulmonary bypass with a dedicated and highly customized perfusion system. Cardiac surgery procedures are complex and entail safety-critical activities, requiring continuous coordination between four subteams: perfusion, surgical, nursing and anesthesia. This environment demands outstanding technical and non-technical skills (e.g. teamwork, communication and situational awareness).  Over the past few decades, technological advancements have improved the safety and efficiency of the perfusion system, however, despite substantial progress, recent studies continue to report a high incidence of preventable intraoperative adverse events among cardiac surgery patients. The perfusion system, in particular, relies heavily on the expertise and skills of the perfusionist, and there is currently no computational intelligent system to support perfusionists’ optimal decision-making during the critical phase of cardiopulmonary bypass.  In this proposal, we seek to develop a data-driven approach to learn from expert perfusionists how to achieve optimal outcomes for cardiac surgery patients. Rather than attempt to engineer a solution, we propose to develop a robot apprentice that can learn from high-quality demonstrations of perfusionist actions to infer gold- standard patient care. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a Robot-Assisted Perfusion System (RAPS) that can be integrated into the cardiac surgery workflow as a non-human teammate.

"Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY In this competitive renewal for R01 CA187427, we will continue to advance label-free Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to enhance the functionality of the widely-used da Vinci Surgical platform with an emphasis on Trans-Oral-Robotic-Surgery (TORS). UC Davis has pioneered the intra-operative use of FLIm and our partner, Intuitive Surgical, is the global leader in robotic-assisted surgery. To date, we have demonstrated a) the synergetic integration of a point-scanning FLIm device with the da Vinci Surgical System (first-of-its-kind); b) the potential of this approach to improve surgical decision-making during TORS without modifying conventional clinical protocols; and c) the utility of FLIM-derived parameters detecting biochemical and metabolic characteristics to distinguish oral and oropharyngeal cancer in real-time from surrounding normal tissue in patients in-situ.. We also developed innovative methods for real-time dynamic augmentation of imaging parameters on the surgical field of view. Capitalizing on the major accomplishments and knowledge gained under the current R01, the overarching objective of this renewal application is to 1) demonstrate FLIm’s diagnostic value in prospective studies by accounting for biological/experimental variables identified as critical under the current R01 and leveraging pre-operative imaging and clinical information and 2) enhance the visualization of FLIm-based classifiers on the surgeon console for real-time intraoperative feedback. To accomplish our overall objective, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Expand the FLIm database and develop tissue-type classifiers (retrospective analysis) accounting for biological variables (e.g., patient age/sex, tumor origin/location) and experimental situations (e.g., epithelial surface vs deep margins, tumors of an unknown primary) and the pre- operative imaging (CT, PET) features used in surgical planning. Aim 2. Develop, validate and perform regulatory activities for enhanced FLIm data visualization in support of prospective clinical studies. Aim 3. Validate FLIm as a means of real-time intraoperative TORS guidance in a prospective study analysis. In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time assessment of oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgical margins. The acquired FLIm parameter database will enable subsequent large clinical trials for automated tissue classification and diagnostic prediction. While the focus of this application is on TORS surgeries, the label-free FLIm-based tissue assessment, characterized by simple, fast and flexible data acquisition and display, can be broadly applied to other procedures as the da Vinci Surgical System is used in a wide range of tumor surgeries including urologic, colorectal, gynecologic, and thoracic cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optimal cancer and functional outcomes from surgical treatment of head and neck cancer requires the surgeon to have the ability to intraoperatively distinguish neoplastic disease from adjacent normal tissue. Our novel optical imaging FLIm technique, coupled to the da Vinci surgical system, captures and analyzes tissue autofluorescence to identify distinct tissue types and display this information onto the surgeon’s field of view during trans-oral- robotic surgery (TORS). This enables a more accurate and optimal cancer removal while preserving adjacent normal tissue and function. The successful validation of FLIm, with the sophisticated incorporation of head and neck cancer patient and radiology data to improve the tissue classifier, will allow for more cures with less long- term side effects and will be easily extended to other robotic and endoscopic procedures, thus advancing innovation well beyond TORS.",Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,10103847,R01HL150100,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' aortic valve ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Estrogen Antagonists ', ' Anti-Estrogens ', ' antiestrogen ', ' antiestrogenic ', ' estrogen inhibitor ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Pulmonary Valve Stenosis ', ' Pulmonary Stenosis ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' United States ', ' Surgical Valves ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' telomere ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Western World ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' ERRalpha ', ' estrogen-related receptor 1 ', ' estrogen-related receptor alpha ', ' ERR1 protein ', ' cell type ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' non-sense mutation ', ' Nonsense Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' telomerase RNA ', ' Telomerase RNA Component ', ' shear stress ', ' Aortic valvular disorders ', ' aortic valve defect ', ' aortic valve disease ', ' aortic valvular disease ', ' aortic valve disorder ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Drosophila Homolog of NOTCH 1 ', ' NOTCH1 ', ' TAN1 ', ' Translocation-Associated NOTCH Homolog ', ' NOTCH1 gene ', ' valve replacement ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' malformation ', ' gene correction ', ' gene-corrected ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' osteogenic ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' bicuspid aortic valve ', ' small molecule therapeutics ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' Drug Screening ', ' endothelial stem cell ', ' endothelial progenitor cell ', ' ']",NHLBI,J.

"Imaging Goggles for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery Interest in the use of optical imaging instruments in medical interventions stems from their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. Of particular interest is the role of optical imaging in oncology. Surgery is the primary curative method for solid tumors confined to the tissue of origin with the goal of completely removing both the tumor mass and microscopic lesions. Unfortunately, the irregular growth pattern and infiltrations into surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete removal in many cases, resulting in positive surgical margins (PSMs). PSMs are prevalent in oncologic surgery, increasing cancer recurrence rates and often necessitates a second surgery to improve disease-specific survival. While PSM occurrence is significant in advanced clinical centers, the situation is worse in many rural hospitals and resource- limited areas due to limited histology infrastructure and workforce needed for margin assessment. Thus there is an urgent need for an intraoperative imaging system to visualize cancer, guide tumor removal, and determine margin positivity in the operating room (OR) in low and high resource settings alike.  Handheld fluorescence imaging systems have been developed to aid cancer resection. Still, they suffer from several limitations, including a significant footprint in the OR and the inability of the operating surgeon to directly control the imaging device while performing surgery. To address these shortcomings, we developed a head- mounted display device (HMD) cancer imaging system for real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). The system HMD captures near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and color images from the surgical bed and displays accurately aligned color-NIR images in real-time, enabling FGS without disrupting surgical workflow. The HMD has a small footprint, is intuitive to use, and is amenable for widespread use, including non-cancer applications such as imaging of peripheral blood flow. Preliminary testing of the HMD system in human cancer patients identified some areas for improvement that will accelerate the eventual clinical adoption of the system worldwide. Addressing these needs requires expertise in packaging software development for medical devices with DICOM image format and user interface development using human factors engineering. We have teamed up with a company that has both expertise and experience in developing augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/VR) software combined with deep machine learning in wearable devices on this project. Together, we will optimize the system performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering. The collaborative project will (1) develop and validate an automated fluorescence thresholding algorithm for tumor delineation; (2) develop and validate automated registration of augmented reality in the system; and (3) develop and evaluate clinical software to improve user experience.  At the completion of this project, we expect to develop and validate a clinic-ready, user-friendly HMD system with a small hardware footprint, enabling seamless integration with surgical workflow to enhance clinical adoption. The system will increase the rates and decrease the time of successful tumor resection. Anticipated low cost and ease of use will expand adoption in low and high resource settings worldwide. This objective approach to cancer surgery will reduce the incidence of PSMs and improve treatment outcomes. Narrative  Optical imaging instruments have permeated medical practice because of their ease of use, rapid adaptation to clinical needs, portability, real-time feedback, and relatively low cost. We have developed a wearable head- mounted display device that is augmented by visible and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tissues in real- time. In collaboration with an industry partner, we will optimize the device performance and ergonomics using human factors engineering.

"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4. Refine numerical (FEM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of the depth-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the cornea.

"Cooperative Control Robotics and Computer Vision: Development of Semi-Autonomous Temporal Bone and Skull Base Surgery Project Summary I am an assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where my practice is focused on neurotology and lateral skull base surgery. I am applying for a mentored surgeon-scientist career development award (CDA) to obtain further training in robotics, deep learning and computer vision. This will further my long-term career goals of improving neurotologic surgical outcomes through novel applications of engineering methods and ultimately to investigate semi-autonomous, robotic interventions in the inner ear and skull base which are beyond the limits of the human hand alone.  Operating in the temporal bone and lateral skull base is technically demanding due to complex three- dimensional anatomy, small working spaces and delicate neurovascular structures. Many of these challenges are ideally suited to semi-autonomous surgical platforms to augment a surgeon’s skills with robotic and image- guided assistance. Despite the widespread implementation of robotic surgery and image guidance in other areas of the body, the field of neurotology has had relatively little adoption of this technology. We believe one reason for this is the precise registration needed in this field, where millimeter differences differentiate a successful from a catastrophic result. This CDA proposes expanding on my prior work investigating cooperative control robotics and virtual safety barriers by using computer vision and deep learning networks to develop highly accurate surgical image registration. This CDA aims to provide me with multi-disciplinary training in the departments of Otolaryngology, Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Specific training goals include: (1) Training in robotics, statistical shape modeling and computer tomography landmark segmentation, (2) Training in deep learning networks and computer vision video image registration, (3) Integrating this training, with my knowledge of temporal bone and skull base surgery to develop into an independent investigator (4) Pursue additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.  The research plan addresses the hypothesis that virtual safety barriers can be accurately enforced by a cooperative control robot, and computer vision methods can be used to automate accurate placement and registration of these safety barriers. I believe that the integration of these techniques will allow for semi- autonomous surgical methods resulting in improved surgical safety and efficiency. The specific aims of the proposal are to: (1) Develop and Validate Cooperative Control Robot Enforced Virtual Safety Barriers for Cortical Mastoidectomy (2) Develop and Test Autonomous Segmentation of Lateral Skull Base Anatomy (3) Develop Video-Based, Fiducial-less, Surgical Image Registration to Detect and Update the 3-D Position of Temporal Bone Anatomy from Intraoperative Stereoscopic Microscope Video. Project Narrative The research proposed here will investigate the feasibility of using novel applications of computer vision and cooperative control robotics to enforce virtual safety barriers in neurotologic surgery. Our long-term goal is to develop semi-autonomous, robotic methods to improve the safety and efficiency of neurotologic surgery, and open the possibilities for surgical interventions which currently are beyond the abilities of the human hand alone.",Cooperative Control Robotics and Computer Vision: Development of Semi-Autonomous Temporal Bone and Skull Base Surgery,10283480,K08DC019708,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Automobiles ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Dura Mater ', ' Dura ', ' Electromagnetics ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Facial nerve structure ', ' Cranial Nerve VII ', ' Facial Nerve ', ' Seventh Cranial Nerve ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Judgment ', ' Labyrinth ', ' Internal Ear ', ' inner ear ', ' Manuals ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Surgical Instruments ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tremor ', ' Work ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' skull base ', ' Basicranium ', ' Basis cranii ', ' Cranial Base ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Sigmoid colon ', ' Sigmoid ', ' Shapes ', ' Robot ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' millimeter ', ' Tactile ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' intraoperative imaging ', ' surgical imaging ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Head and Neck Surgery ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' image registration ', ' Outcome ', ' vision development ', ' visual development ', ' visual system development ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' stereoscopic ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning network ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NIDCD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,191792
"Molecular guided surgery for enhanced resection of solid tumors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate's transition to a role as a leading academic researcher and multidisciplinary team member developing optical fluorescence-based technology, with the goal of improving extent of tumor resection (EOTR) in brain cancer. In particular, a focus of this proposal is on advancing fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) within the context of neurosurgical oncology.

"Artificial Intelligence Driven Tools for Objective Surgical Performance Improvement Abstract / Summary Currently, supervised surgical training provides only a small fraction of surgical experience in the career of a practicing surgeon. Surgeons’ skill develops throughout their career. Surgeons benefit from supervised feedback from experts during training, but they lose such structured and specific feedback once they begin independent practice. Surgical skill is associated with patient outcomes. Therefore, supporting surgeons’ continuous professional learning through automated structured resources can improve patient care. The status quo for surgeons in practice is to measure patient outcomes or other process of care variables as indirect measures of their skill. These measures do not inform surgeons how to improve. The goal in this project is to develop tools to analyze videos of the surgical field to provide surgeons with unbiased skill assessments and specific feedback on how to improve. This project includes integration of these tools into a personalized surgical learning platform and evaluation of its effectiveness for surgeons’ skill acquisition. To achieve this goal, this project includes a multi-disciplinary team to include expertise in ophthalmology, surgical education, surgical data science, computer vision, machine learning and deep learning, statistics, and human-computer interaction. The video analysis tools developed in this project will enable the following for cataract surgery, one of the most common surgical procedures in the U.S. and across the world: 1) objective assessments of surgeons’ skill; 2) provide surgeons with specific feedback on how to improve that is personalized given their past performance; and 3) preliminary evidence of effectiveness of a personalized learning platform for surgeons’ skill acquisition. The anticipated impact of our work is to create a pathway in which the surgeon is incentivized to see themselves and their performance as part of the process of improving outcomes and value in care, and institutions have access to objective tools to create reproducible standards for surgical competency. Project Narrative  Surgical skill develops over the entire duration of a surgeon’s career, and well beyond their supervised training period. Currently, no methods for objective assessment of skill performance exist to identify and accelerate improvement in skill and, in turn, improve patient outcomes. This project develops a novel usable video-based personalized surgical learning platform, automated using artificial intelligence methods, for surgeons to effectively improve their skill.",Artificial Intelligence Driven Tools for Objective Surgical Performance Improvement,10279444,R01EY033065,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Cataract Extraction ', ' cataract surgery ', ' Complication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Competence ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Capsulorhexis ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' personalized learning ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' dashboard ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' adverse event risk ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,460000
"Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers 1 FROM PARENT PROJECT R01CA240771  2 Superficially spreading types of skin cancers such as lentigo maligna melanomas (LMMs) and non-melanoma  3 skin cancers (NMSCs) occur mostly on older patients, with diffuse sub-clinical sub-surface spread over large  4 areas and with poorly defined margins that are difficult to detect. To treat these cancers, dermatologists rou-  5 tinely perform a large number of mapping biopsies to determine the spread and margins, followed by surgical  6 excision with wide ""safety"" margins. Not surprisingly, such a ""blind"" approach results in under-sampling of the  7 margins, over-sampling of normal skin, too many false positives and false negatives, and too much loss of  8 normal skin tissue. What may help address this problem is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging to  9 noninvasively delineate margins, directly on patients. RCM imaging detects skin cancers in vivo with sensitivity 10 of 85-95% and specificity 80-70%. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted reim- 11 bursement codes for RCM imaging of skin. RCM imaging is now being increasingly used to noninvasively 12 guide diagnosis, sparing patients from biopsies of benign lesions. While the two-decade effort to date was fo- 13 cused on imaging-guided diagnosis, emerging applications are in imaging to guide therapy. We propose to 14 create an approach called RCM video-mosaicking, to noninvasively map skin cancer margins over large areas 15 on patients, with increased sampling, accuracy and sparing of normal tissue. The parent project specific aims 16 are (1) to develop a real-time and robust RCM video-mosaicking approach and incorporate into a handheld 17 confocal microscope for use at the bedside, (2) to test the approach for image quality and clinical acceptability, 18 and (3) to prospectively test on 100 patients, with video-mosaicking of LMM margins and superficial NMSC 19 margins, followed by validation against post-surgical pathology. 20 PROPOSED DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT PROJECT FOR Ms. ANABEL ALFONSO 21 The proposed project for Ms. Anabel Alfonso will build upon the parent project and extend it in a completely 22 novel direction. In the parent project, RCM video-mosaics will be visually read by Mohs surgeons during sur- 23 gery. The innovation in Anabel’s project will be the development of a new machine learning-based algorithm 24 for automated detection and mapping of LMM margins in video-mosaics, toward automating, standardizing and 25 increasing the speed and efficiency of video-mosaicking for Mohs surgeons at the bedside. The specific aims 26 for Anabel’s project are to (1) develop an image classification and segmentation algorithm that automatically 27 analyzes RCM video-mosaics, highlights diagnostically significant areas (malignant versus normal) in LMM 28 margins and provides real-time diagnostic feedback to Mohs surgeons; (2) to test and validate the algorithm on 29 RCM videos and video-mosaics obtained from LMMs on 50 patients. Acquisition of the videos and video- 30 mosaics will occur during the parent project. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH SAME AS PARENT PROJECT R01CA240771 Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can noninvasively diagnose skin cancers and spare patients from biopsies of benign skin conditions. We will develop an approach to noninvasively map skin cancer margins, to help guide less invasive surgery, and help more accurately and completely remove cancer while preserving more of the surrounding normal skin.",Confocal video-mosaicking microscopy to guide surgery of superficially spreading skin cancers,10309506,R01CA240771,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', "" Hutchinson's Melanotic Freckle "", ' Lentigo Maligna ', ' Lentigo Maligna Melanoma ', ' Malignant Lentigo ', ' Malignant Lentigo Melanoma ', ' Melanotic Freckle ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Video Microscopy ', ' Videomicrography ', ' Videomicroscopy ', ' Dermatologist ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer ', ' nonmelanoma skin cancer ', ' Skin Carcinoma ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Skin ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' blind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parent project ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning network ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' prospective test ', ' clinical imaging ', ' reflectance confocal microscopy ', ' in vivo confocal microscopy ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,81243
"Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy More than 1/3 of the world’s 65 million people with epilepsy (~3.3 million in the U.S.) have seizures that cannot be controlled by medications. Surgery and implanted devices are options for many, but their success depends upon manually mapping epileptic networks, which is only possible for some patients, and poorly standardized. When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care. Over the first four years of this grant we have made substantial progress towards these goals. Our deliverables include: (1) robust measures derived from intracranial EEG (IEEG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery; (2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and iEEG; and (4) a track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on our platform http: //ieeg.org. In the next phase, we propose innovative solutions to 3 fundamental challenges in epilepsy surgery required to translate our work into practice: (1) Guiding SEEG: We must adapt our methods to the sparser sampling and different philosophy of stereo EEG, which maps a network of connected brain regions and tests clinical hypotheses about where seizures initiate and propagate; (2) Assessing sampling bias and missing information: We will develop methods to determine if electrodes sample all key regions of the epileptic network, to ensure we do not falsely localize due to missing information; (3) Validating in a larger population across centers: In parallel to refining the above methods, we will validate and optimize our analyses in a large number of patients to ready this work for a prospective clinical trial. In a novel model, we have engaged a group of major surgical epilepsy centers to openly collaborate, standardize methods, aggregate data, and share all algorithms, computer code, data and results on http: //ieeg.org. Our central hypothesis is that standardized, quantitative methods to guide epilepsy surgery can improve patient outcomes, lower morbidity, reduce cost and enable uniform, higher quality care across centers. This work is significant because it merges state of the art network neuroscience, engineering, neurology and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care. This project leverages a thriving collaboration between experts in neurology, computational neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroimaging and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania that has generated 58 publications related to this proposal. We now extend this collaboration to academic epilepsy centers across the United States and worldwide. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing new quantitative methods to target and test epilepsy surgery in computer models before doing these procedures in the operating room will improve patient outcomes and reduce surgery side effects and costs. In this research we are also working with 15 major epilepsy centers to standardize treatment. For these reasons the proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission to foster fundamental, creative discoveries and innovative research strategies that will ultimately protect and improve human health for the United States’ 3.3 million people with epilepsy.",Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy,10355919,R56NS099348,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Archives ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Information Theory ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philosophy ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' computer code ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2021,551628
"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10269935,K25HD104004,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cesarean section ', ' Abdominal Delivery ', ' C section ', ' Cesarean ', ' Chemistry ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Counseling ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Leadership ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Accreta ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Spin Labels ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' High-Risk Pregnancy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' intrapartum ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' fetal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellularity ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' high risk ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' radiomics ', ' Abnormal placentation ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2021,113811
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery Abstract:  Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.  Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes. Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing, surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue” approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect, a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.  In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.  Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.  The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome- driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery. Project Narrative: 1. In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring orthognathic surgery for jaw  deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissue, or both, is escalating every ear. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan orthognathic surgery by virtually repositioning bony  segments to desired locations, they are still unable to practically predict the ultimate treatment outcomes  of orthognathic surgery, a desired postoperative facial appearance, during the surgical planning. 3. We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,10225298,R01DE021863,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' bone ', ' Ear ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Jaw ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Mandible ', ' Inferior Maxillary Bone ', ' mandibular ', ' Maxilla ', ' maxillary ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patients ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' soft tissue ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' skeletal ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Skeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Defect ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' orthognathic ', ' orthognathous ', ' craniomaxillofacial ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk minimization ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' learning network ', ' virtual surgery ', ' Surgical Simulation ', ' virtual reality surgery ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' ']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,616572
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT).

"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,10086887,R01HL150147,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Registries ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spinal Fusion ', ' Spondylosyndeses ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Spirometry ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Diseases ', ' Thoracic Disorder ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vital capacity ', ' Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Gender ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pulmonary function ', ' lung function ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Spinal ', ' respiratory ', ' Orthopedic Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' health assessment ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ventilation ', ' Rod ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,769122
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Clinical Paths ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sentinel Node Biopsy ', ' Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Habitats ', ' cancer care ', ' Formalin ', ' Radio ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Multiparametric Analysis ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Resected ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neoplastic ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' arm ', ' Breast Carcinogenesis ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' breast malignancies ', ' Metastatic breast cancer ', ' radiomics ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep learning ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Acidosis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Attention ', ' Axilla ', ' Armpit ', ' Axillary ', ' Underarm ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteins ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' base ', ' Excision biopsy ', ' Excisional Biopsy ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' ']",NCI,H.
