"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse

"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,10140399,R01HD100036,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Lentils -

"High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in nearly one percent of live births each year and are the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality. The majority of genetic studies in CHD have focused on variation within the protein-coding exome; however, most disease-risk loci fall in noncoding regions, and it is presumed that some of these represent important regulators of gene expression such as cis-acting enhancers and insulators. In spite of these studies, less than half of the heritability of CHD has been explained via genome-wide associations or burden testing of protein-coding genes and putative regulatory elements. In this proposal, we hypothesize that genetic variants that alter 3D genome folding contribute to the etiology of CHD by disrupting the contacts of key cis-regulatory mechanisms in development. One type of chromatin structure that could be affected is the Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), which refers to a level of chromatin organization characterized by higher contact frequency within the domain relative to loci outside of that domain. It has been shown that while unaffected controls show a clear depletion of SVs at TAD boundary regions across the genome, individuals diagnosed with Developmental Delay (DD) and autism showed no bias in the genomic location of SVs. Based on these findings and the high rates of co-morbidity between DD and CHD, the first aim characterizes structural variation at TAD boundaries and other non-coding regulatory regions in CHD relative to controls, and will further determine whether TADs are enriched for SVs in a region-specific manner based on proximity to genes active in the developing heart. In the second aim, we use a complementary annotation- agnostic deep learning approach developed in our group to predict chromatin contact changes as a result of genetic variants in CHD patients. We will use Hi-C sequencing to confirm the model-predicted chromatin contact effects in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and additionally use RNA sequencing to determine whether the hypothesized transcriptional disruption occurred. Finally, in the third aim we will create a model that uses genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of genetic variants found in each individual to predict their phenotypic status. By analyzing the relative importance of features used to make predictions, we will be able to determine what types of biological mechanisms and pathways are most predictive for congenital heart anomalies. Collectively, these findings will elucidate a currently underappreciated source of regulatory disruption in human development, identify new disease-relevant genes and potential therapeutic targets, and will refine and validate a method for the high-throughput prediction of chromatin contact frequency to advance the field of 3D genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality, congenital heart defects have been studied extensively to better understand their underlying genetic mechanisms. However, previous approaches have focused on direct mutations to protein-coding elements and were not sufficient to explain the full heritability of this disease. Our proposal posits that an underappreciated disease mechanism is transcriptional misregulation during development caused by variants that disrupt 3D genome organization, and we therefore aim to characterize the extent to which this occurs in human heart defects and validate specific examples.",High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital

"Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease SUMMARY  Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re- search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, including highly sensitive and reproducible cardiac transcription factor ChIP-seq through in vivo biotinyla- tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV- MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac- tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea- tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF. NARRATIVE  The heart's upper chambers, the atria, and its lower chambers, the ventricles, contain fundamentally dis- tinct types of muscle cells, and are affected by different types of disease. One common and severe disease specific to the atria is atrial fibrillation, which occurs in over 9% of older individuals. This proposal will investi- gate the mechanisms that maintain atrial muscle cell gene expression, and perturbation of these mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation, resulting in new insights into the causes of atrial diseases such as atrial fibrillation.",Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease,10138240,R01HL156503,"['trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart

"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell

"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect ', '

"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Hemophilia B ', ' Christmas Disease ', ' Factor IX Deficiency ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Factor IX ', ' Autoprothrombin II ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IX ', ' Christmas Factor ', ' Coagulation Factor IX ', ' EC 3.4.21.22 ', ' Factor IX Complex ', ' Factor IX Fraction ', ' Plasma Thromboplastin Component ', ' antihemophilic factor B ', ' thromboplastinogen B ', ' Factor XIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor XI ', ' Activated Factor XI ', ' Coagulation Factor XIa ', ' Contact Activation Product ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Antibody Technique ', "" Coon's Technic "", "" Coon's Technique "", ' Fluorescent Antibody Technic ', ' Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody Test ', ' Immunofluorescence Technic ', ' Immunofluorescence Technique ', ' fluorescent antibody ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hemophilia A ', ' Factor VIII Deficiency ', ' Hemophilia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' carboxylation ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Cell surface ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' F9 gene ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' gain of function ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical translation ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767
"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods.

"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families.

"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering

"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Weight ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Mouse Cell Line ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' blind ', ' Coupled ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256
"Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome ABSTRACT Noncoding genetic variation that alters gene regulation is of paramount importance for health, disease, and evolution. Diseases ranging in incidence from the most common to the most rare all have substantial risk associated with regulatory variation; and most of the genetic differences between closely related species are noncoding. Whole genome sequencing can directly identify that variation but to realize its potential to elucidate the genetic determinants of health and disease, will require accurate annotation of this noncoding variation for functionality. In coding sequence, the genetic code allows variants to be annotated to a rough hierarchy of likely functional effects and pathogenicity. In noncoding sequence such annotation is less clear. Perturbation assays, i.e., assays that modify genetic or epigenetic states and measure the effect of those perturbations on regulatory endpoints, offer a possible path to annotating noncoding variation. However, to fully leverage this data, novel and sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches are required to extract useful information from those assays, to integrate that information across regulatory endpoints, and to extrapolate findings so that annotation of previously unobserved (unperturbed) variation in diverse cell types is possible. The goal of the Duke Prediction Center is to develop the analytic approaches and tools that will allow for the routine annotation of noncoding variation for functionality and ultimately pathogenicity. Aim 1 is to establish best practices in perturbation assay design and analysis. This will allow IGVF characterization centers design their experiments so that, when coupled with optimized analyses, the data produced will be maximally informative for subsequent predictive modeling. Aim 2 is to develop novel mechanistic machine learning approaches for predicting the functional effect of noncoding variation on function in diverse cell-types. Aim 3 is to identify noncoding genomic regions that are subject to functional constraint which will be leveraged in prioritizing variants for pathogenicity. The expected outcomes of this project will be (i) robust estimates of optimal experimental design parameters and recommendations for analysis tools and best practices for the various assays used within the IGVF consortium, (ii) predicted functional effects of observed variation to be shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog as well as a state-of-the-art machine learning method (and associated tools) that can identify previously-unknown interactions among genomic variants, both observed and novel, and predict their functional impact in diverse cell types, and (iii) a list of regulatory elements subject to functional constraint shared through the IGVF variant/phenotype catalog and a principled prioritization framework (and associated tools) for interpreting variation within patient genomes for pathogenicity. Due to the considerable success of genetics, there are thousands of unknown regulatory causes of disease. Each of those causes is an opportunity to improve treatment, diagnostics, or prevention. This project will be a major advance towards unlocking that potential. PROJECT NARRATIVE The culmination of the proposal will be a systematic and comprehensive approach for interpreting noncoding variants to understand the underlying mechanisms that link genetics to gene expression and causes of human disease. That outcome will transform human disease studies by allowing noncoding sequence variation to inform genetic causes of disease, both in novel disease gene discovery studies and in the diagnostic interpretation of individual patient genomes.","Design, prediction, and prioritization of systematic perturbations of the human genome",10295506,U01HG011967,"['machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Endpoint Assays ', ' End Point Assay ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Update ', ' Output ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' individual patient ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' ']",NHGRI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,353667
"Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with spatiotemporally-resolved single-cell multiomics PROJECT SUMMARY A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. The majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are located within non-coding genomic regions and may affect genome functions and phenotypes through modulating the activity of cis- regulatory elements and cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, our knowledge about the impact of genomic variants (alone or as combinations) on gene expression, GRN activity and ultimately cellular phenotypes are rather limited. Further, because transcription factors (TFs) and related cis-regulatory elements are known to have distinct functions based on cell-type and state, how genomic variants influence cell-type/state-specific activity of functional elements and phenotypes remains to be characterized in much greater details. This proposal aims to leverage a panel of multi-ethnic, gender-balanced human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines (European, African American and African hunter gatherers) as well as recent advances in single- cell time-resolved or multi-omics technologies, predictive modeling of regulatory networks by machine learning and high throughput single-cell perturbation methods to study the functional impact of genomic variations on regulatory network, cellular phenotypes. First, we will establish a robust experimental framework of deploying advanced time-resolved and multi-omic single-cell technologies for detecting functional genetic variants at single-cell level. Next, we will develop novel computational methods for integration of single-cell data across different modalities and for accurate reconstruction and predictive modeling of GRNs driving cellular identify, developmental dynamics (cardiac and neural lineage cell fate transition). Finally, we will apply high-throughput combinatorial genetic or epigenetic perturbation approaches to modulate activity of key genes or putative cis- regulatory elements at single-cell levels to improve our understanding of network level relationships among genomic variants and phenotypes. PROJECT NARRATIVE A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence phenotypes. Our in-depth characterization of functional impact of genomic variation on human developmental gene regulatory networks in ancestrally diverse populations will provide critical insights into human development and diseases and have the potential to greatly help translating disease risk alleles to therapeutic targets.",Defining causal roles of genomic variants on gene regulatory networks with

"Predicting context-specific molecular and phenotypic effects of genetic variation through the lens of the cis-regulatory code ABSTRACT A central challenge in human genomics is to interpret the regulatory functions of the noncoding genome, and to identify and interpret variants with regulatory functions. In this project we plan to leverage recent advances in experimental functional genomics (including single cell methods and high throughput perturbation methods) alongside recent progress in deep learning models of gene regulation, to make fundamental progress on these problems. We have assembled a team of investigators with diverse and complementary expertise – in deep learning, single-cell genomics, cellular QTLs and GWAS, and high throughput validations – to build, test, and implement predictive models for interpreting disease associations. Specifically, we aim to (1) Develop interpretable base-resolution deep-learning models for regulatory sequences; (2) Predict and validate cell type- specific effects of regulatory variants on molecular phenotypes and disease; (3) Collaborate with the IGVF Consortium to build nucleotide-level regulatory maps. Our ultimate goal in this project will be to create a nucleotide-resolution cis-regulatory map of the human genome to connect disease variants to functions and phenotypes, in diverse cell types, states, and spatial contexts.

"Predicting Phenotype by Deep Learning Heterogeneous Multi-Omics Data Project Summary Complex disease and traits are caused by dynamic genetic regulation and environmental interactions. Numerous genetic, genomic, and phenotypic datasets have been generated, including genotypes, gene expression, epigenetic changes, and electronic medical records (EMRs). Currently, there is main challenge on development of novel informatic approaches to effectively link phenotype with genomic information. Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with the disease and traits; however, more than 80% of them are noncoding variants, making it difficult to interpret their potential disease-causal roles. We and others have systematically examined how phenotypic variability in disease risk for a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes can be explained by regulatory variants. Now, we hypothesize that such regulation will be in a tissue-specific, cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific (TCD-specific) manner. Importantly, large genomic consortia, like ENCODE, FANTOM5, the Roadmap Epigenomics, and GTEx have continuously generated high-quality functional data for annotating genome-wide variants. The emerging single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine how genetic variants affect cellular functions within individual cells or specific cell types. This brings us an unprecedented opportunity to develop novel statistical and computational approaches for deep understanding of the genetic architecture of phenotype. In this proposal, we combine bioinformatics, single cell omics, deep learning, and phenotype and EMR data mining to develop novel analytical strategies that maximally leverage information from both genotype and expression from massive heterogeneous data, aiming to predict phenotype by functional assessment of DNA variation at the TCD-specific levels. We propose the following three specific aims. (1) To develop a deep learning method for variant impact predictor, DeepVIP, that maximally utilizes functional and regulatory data to predict the causal roles of variants in complex disease and traits. (2) To develop phenotype-specific network approaches to resolve genotype-phenotype relationships in the spatiotemporal manner and single-cell resolution. We will develop a novel method, single cell dense module search of GWAS signals (scGWAS) and also a graphical neural network approach, GNN-scTP, to detect driving roles of genes from single cell RNA-seq data. These methods can effectively identify critical regulatory modules and genes in complex disease in the TCD-specific manner. (3) To apply the methods to 16 neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders and related traits, as well as broad phenotypes using Vanderbilt biobank (BioVU) and UK Biobank data – both have genotypes linked with rich phenotypic information. Our proposal is timely and innovative to study the genetic architecture in human complex diseases and traits by dissecting important genetic components, especially noncoding variants, at the functional, regulatory, spatial, temporal, and single cell levels. Project Narrative The rapid advances in genome technologies and medical informatics have helped investigators generate huge amount of biological and biomedical data, including genome-wide DNA variation, tissue-specific gene expression, functional genomic annotations, and electronic medical records. To effectively mine such highly dimensional and heterogeneous datasets, we will develop novel computational methods to assess the functional impact of genetic variants in the human genome and study

"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' computational pipelines ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Exons ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligation ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Body part ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Live Birth ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' gene interaction ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Neural Crest Cell ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST 1 ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST1 ', ' TWIST gene ', ' TWIST1 ', ' Transcription Factor TWIST ', ' twist protein ', ' TWIST1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' orofacial ', ' virtual ', ' Coupled ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' epigenome ', ' FaceBase ', ' genetic information ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' differential expression ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations.

"Functional genetic variants in substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this study is to identify functional genetic variants that are associated with SUDs, and thereby contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying these devastating disorders. Our overall objectives are to (i) design and implement a series of experimental methods to assess the impact of genetic variants relevant to SUDs and related traits and computational models to predict the impact of additional variants, and (ii) establish a statistical genetics framework to more effectively identify additional genes that contribute to the disorders. This proposal builds upon our previous studies on the role of genomic variation in gene regulation and will generate new data to combine with existing multi-omics data and modeling. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Identify functional genetic variants that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders and related phenotypes by affecting gene regulation, using a series of high-throughput reporter assays to evaluate the impact of tens of thousands of non- coding variations in enhancers, promoters and 3’UTRs on gene expression in eight cell lines representing four major cell types in brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). Variants with a modest association with substance use disorders and related traits will be selected from the GWAS catalog and experiments underway. Data on the initial large sets of variants will be used to predict, using machine learning approaches, the functional impact of additional regulatory variants. A large subset of the variants predicted to be functional will then be tested with follow-up HTRAs, and the predictive models refined based upon the data. 2. Identify genes whose expression changes contribute to the risk for SUDs. We will use Mendelian Randomization-based methods based on the data derived from Aim 1 plus GWAS data from the PGC and other large consortia to identify causal genes whose expression changes in specific cell types contribute to SUD-related phenotypes. Upon completion of these studies, we will have created a unique, accessible resource of SUD-associated genetic variants that regulate target gene expression in specific brain cell types. These genes can serve as high priority candidates for future functional and animal-based studies. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of high-throughput reporter assays and computational methods for prioritizing causal genetic variants and identifying driver genes that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders. This is directly relevant to the missions of NIH to improve the capability of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these devastating disorders.

"Sequence models of genome regulatory architecture in 3D Project Summary Interpreting individual genome sequence and the consequence of any sequence variation is critical for the study of the genetic basis of diseases and the path toward precision medicine. Genomic sequence is at the basis of multiple levels of genome regulation which are highly intertwined, including chromatin protein binding, 3D genome architecture, and gene transcription. Decoding these regulatory functions directly from the sequence will provide a computational platform for scalable prediction of variant effects and interrogation of base pair-level sequence functions with “in silico mutagenesis”. Progress has been made in decoding regulatory genomic sequence, including with the development of deep learning sequence models. However, the sequence-basis of complex phenomena such as transcriptional regulation will not be fully resolved without accounting for genome structure and long-range 3D sequence context. Genome structures at multiple spatial scales, including promoter- enhancer interactions, transcriptional condensates, topologically associating domains, chromatin compartments, and nuclear bodies can have strong impacts on transcriptional regulation. With data and techniques that have only now become sufficient to tackle this challenge, we will study these phenomena and trace complex regulatory output back to the basis of sequence dependencies by developing sequence models of 3D genome regulatory architecture. We will develop a computational framework of deep learning sequence models with the capability of modeling multiscale 3D genome interactions and integrating long-range sequence information, for comprehensively interpreting the regulatory functions of genome sequence. The proposed work will open up new possibilities for interpreting and applying structural and transcriptional impacts of sequence variations, including asking how genetic factors, such as large structural variants, affect gene expression through remodeling of genome structural organization in healthy and disease states. Project Narrative The genomic sequence directs its 3D organization and gene regulation which is essential for the normal development and function of the human body. Genome variations across individuals may disrupt structural and gene regulations and contribute to susceptibility to diseases and response to therapeutics, yet the consequences of genome variations are generally unknown.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non-coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well-described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome-wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE’s utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 100,000 CREs and 375,000 variants, representing ~100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element’s regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 20 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,10241056,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' trait ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2021,1496338
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,10238770,F31MH123131,"['Accounting ',

"Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening We propose to evaluate whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an approach for population screening of early-onset treatable recessively inherited conditions. Our analysis will be based on prior and additional work on the large, ancestrally diverse cohort of children constituting all 1,334 cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry screening in California over an 8.5 year period.  Our prior analysis found that WES lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace current newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A screening-optimized DNA variant interpretation pipeline identified two known or likely pathogenic variants in most, but not all, affected cases. The pipeline was 88% sensitive and 98.4% specific, numbers too low to replace MS/MS. We found that 1/3 of known or likely pathogenic variants were novel, of which roughly 2/3 were missense. Adequate sensitivity and specificity therefore require accurate annotation of missense variants.  DNA variant annotation has focused on individual variants and is most applicable for dominant disorders for which pathogenicity is determined by a single variant. For recessive diseases, expression is determined by two variants on different chromosomes. We propose a new framework for disease prediction in recessive conditions, in which the bi-allelic variants, or diplotype, is used to assess pathogenicity. We will improve disease detection for autosomal recessive diseases through screening utilizing DNA sequencing by 1) improving interpretation of bi-allelic missense variants by using variant co-evolution, conservation, amino acid proximity and other features to derive a risk score, 2) considering both variants in recessive pathogenicity prediction, and 3) using the California newborn screening data set as a training set with a small number of positives for each disorder and a large number of controls (those cases positive for a different disease) to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict likelihood of disease. To address sensitivity, for 103 exome negative IEM cases from our data set we will fully interrogate the exome data, both for known IEM genes and also the entire exome to identify novel genes. Finally, for those remaining unsolved, we will perform WGS to identify additional causal variants. In so doing, we will also compare WES and WGS in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity for screening.  We anticipate that the proposed study will be a significant advance in assessing DNA sequencing as a newborn screening tool for those early-onset treatable diseases for which there is currently no screening test, leading to decreased death and disability. We propose to improve DNA sequencing as a newborn screening test by increasing the sensitivity and specificity to an acceptable level for those early-onset treatable disorders for which there is no alternative screening test. Given the large number of early-onset treatable conditions for which there is no test, or for which current testing continues to miss cases, DNA sequencing has the potential to have a large public health impact. Current newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry is able to detect 40-50 disorders and is considered to be among the ten greatest public health successes of the first decade of the 21st century by the Centers for Disease Control; DNA based newborn screening could greatly increase the number of disorders identified and lead to timely and disease-specific interventions, thereby further decreasing death and disability due to treatable, early-onset recessive disorders.",Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening,10228509,R21HG011805,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' California ', ' Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia) ', ' CP Synthase I ', ' CPS I ', ' Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I ', ' Carbamoylphosphate Synthetase I ', ' carbamoylphosphate synthase ', ' carbon dioxide ammonia ligase ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Recessive Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Homocystinuria ', ' cystathionine synthase deficiency ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Vitamin B6 ', ' Pyridoxin ', ' Pyridoxol ', ' VIT B6 ', ' Vitamin B 6 ', ' pyridoxine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' early onset ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' early screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Urea cycle disorders ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,323000
"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The results may lead to novel therapeutic targets for treating opioid use disorders.",Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel.,10221853,U01DA053672,"['Oral ', ' Protocol ', '

"Learning about the evolution of structural variations from genomic and transcriptomic data PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variations are key drivers of both evolutionary adaptation and human disease. My group develops and applies computational and statistical approaches for understanding the evolution of structural variations from patterns in their genomic and transcriptomic data. During the past few years, our studies have focused primarily on gene duplication, which represents the most common type of structural variation observed in nature. In particular, we investigated the origins of evolutionary innovation after gene duplication, a problem of long- standing interest in the evolutionary genomics community. To answer this question, we designed the first method for classifying evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes from phylogenetic comparisons of their gene expression profiles. By applying this decision tree method to multi-tissue gene expression data, we were able to classify evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes in Drosophila, mammals, and grasses. These studies revealed frequent tissue-specific expression divergence after duplication, as well as sequence and expression differences within and among taxa that are consistent with natural selection. In a follow-up population-genomic analysis, we demonstrated that natural selection indeed plays an important role in the evolutionary outcomes of young duplicate genes in Drosophila. Later, we developed analogous decision tree classifiers for two additional types of structural variations: gene deletion and translocation. Applications of our methods to sequence and expression data from multiple tissues and developmental stages in Drosophila uncovered rapid divergence concordant with adaptation, suggesting that natural selection shapes the evolutionary trajectories of structural variations generated by deletion and translocation as well. However, our recent analyses revealed that there are many limitations of these decision tree methods, including sensitivity to gene expression stochasticity, lack of statistical support, and inability to predict parameters driving the evolution of structural variations. Thus, during the next five years, my group will develop a suite of tailored model-based statistical and machine learning approaches for classifying the evolutionary outcomes and predicting the evolutionary parameters of structural variations arising from duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation events. Our preliminary studies indicate that these techniques will be much more powerful and accurate than previous approaches, and will therefore compose major advancements in evolutionary investigations of structural variations. In addition to implementing our methods in open source software packages, we will apply them to assay the evolutionary implications of different types of structural variations in humans and several other animal and plant taxa. Comparisons will be made among different types of structural variations, their evolutionary outcomes, and taxonomic groups. The major goal of these studies will be to ascertain the general rules by which different types of structural variation contribute to evolutionary innovation. Together, these studies will shed light on how gene duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation work in concert to generate a diversity of complex adaptations across the tree of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Just like a population of organisms, genome size and composition can change over time via births, deaths, and migrations of large DNA segments. These mutation events result in genomic structural variations among individuals that underlie many important human adaptations, such as color vision, and diseases, such as cancer.

"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' data pipeline ', ' computational pipelines ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248
"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants,10415312,R00HG010157,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' gene interaction ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug resource ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University ', ' VICC ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cancer type ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genomic variation ', ' clinically actionable ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' web-based tool ', ' Visualization ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NHGRI,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R00,2021,249000
"Molecular determinants of pathogenicity in viral conjunctivitis ABSTRACT  Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is one of the most common conditions in all of medicine. Despite being a common cause of morbidity world-wide, there are no known host or pathogen factors that predict clinical outcomes in this condition. A recent, large, international clinical study of adenovirus-related conjunctivitis revealed that approximately 10% of patients suffer from long term visual loss. A limited deep DNA sequencing study of AdV D8 clinical samples conducted under our previous R21 (1R21EY027453) revealed unexpected sequence diversity in the viral genome, with approximately 600 sequence variants among 87 samples within the same hexon-defined molecular type. These variants assorted into three subtypes with different propensity to poor outcome. Remarkably, using machine learning approaches, we found we were able to predict one critical outcome – the development of subepithelial infiltrates – from knowledge of the viral sequence alone.  Our previous study sequenced samples from the placebo arm of the NVC-422 clinical trial. We have an additional 157 AdV D8 samples that have not been sequenced. In Aim 1 we propose sequencing the adenovirus of these samples in order to a.) further characterize the sequence diversity of AdV D8 and b.) validate our machine learning method for predicting development of subeptithelial infiltrates While AdV D8 was the most prevalent cause of AKC in our study worldwide, unexpectedly we found in the United States that AdV E4 was the most prevalent type. In Aim 2, we propose fully sequencing all 36 samples in the study from type E4, as well as 23 samples from type B3, 9 samples from D19, and a total of 35 samples distributed between type D53, D56, and D64 to determine their molecular diversity, and to apply the same machine learning methods to this set of samples to determine if outcomes can be predicted from viral sequence variants for these types as for AdVD8. The results of these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of viral conjunctivitis, and will provide biomarkers for predicting outcomes from this condition.

"Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation Abstract Natural genetic variation impacts most human diseases, yet predicting how regulatory variants control gene expression and ultimately disease phenotypes poses considerable challenges. First, the polygenic inheritance influencing most conditions requires consideration of a vast number of genes and regulatory elements. This task is challenged by the complexity of gene regulation, where 3D regulatory interactions can link enhancers and genes over large genomic distances. Second, multiple interacting cell types are often dysregulated in disease pathology. This necessitates an understanding of how the collective variants associating with a disease affect each cell type involved in the disease process and subsequently how these dysregulated cellular phenotypes crossregulate and drive subsequent cellular states. In this IGVF project, we will use rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a human autoimmune inflammatory disease, as a case study to develop robust machine learning models of gene regulation to decipher the impact of genomic variation on multiple cellular drivers of pathology—namely, inflammatory T cell and fibroblast subsets found in affected joint tissue. The choice of RA is motivated by its public health importance, specified target tissue, access to clinical samples, considerable knowledge of disease-associated gene loci, and our team’s complementary expertise in machine learning, RA pathophysiology, immunology and inflammation, and single-cell functional genomics. We will develop an advanced machine learning framework to model the effects of allelic variation on gene regulatory networks based on the analysis of epigenomes, transcriptomes, and connectomes of mouse activated T cells and synovial fibroblasts and extend these models to RA patient joint tissue and primary cells. We will train allele-specific gene regulatory models (GRMs) that account for long-range regulatory interactions by integrating single-cell transcriptome and epigenome (sc-multiome) data with bulk 3D interactome analyses. A notable feature of our approach is that we leverage the genetic diversity of evolutionarily distant F1 hybrid mice to provide robust training data for these models, and then apply these advances to the human context through transfer learning. Highly parallelized Perturb-seq experiments in primary synovial fibroblasts from RA patients with single-cell multiomic readouts will then be used to evaluate and refine regulatory models and to train network models that connect gene expression programs to phenotype. Finally, we will combine spatial and single-cell transcriptomics conducted on samples from RA inflamed joints to model the organization and interactions between T cells and sedentary tissue-organizing fibroblasts within local cellular communities. The predictive GRMs that will be generated from our study along with the experimental systems for human disease will be readily transferrable to other polygenic disorders which must consider complex regulatory genomic networks for various interacting cell types in affected tissues. Narrative We will develop advanced machine learning approaches to combine single-cell multiomic and bulk 3D interactome data to model the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation, using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a disease model. Our gene regulatory models and experimental analyses will focus on two cell types that drive RA tissue pathology—T cells and synovial fibroblasts—and will serve as a case study for examining the genetics of polygenic human diseases that dysregulate multiple interacting cell types within affected tissues.",Deciphering the Genomics of Gene Network Regulation of T Cell and Fibroblast States in Autoimmune Inflammation,10305241,U01HG012103,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inflammation ', ' arthropathies ', ' Joint Diseases ', ' arthropathic ', ' arthropathy ', ' joint disorder ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Public Health ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Enhancers ', ' Immunology ', ' Organizational Models ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' empowered ', ' human data ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' CAST/EiJ Mouse ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' T cell regulation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' experimental analysis ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' epigenome ', ' genomic variation ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' joint inflammation ', ' inflamed joint ', ' joint swelling ', ' cell community ', ' cellular community ', ' mouse genetics ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Autoimmune ', ' autoimmune inflammation ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2021,1280000
"Model-based methods for single cell chromatin interactomic data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) have been identified in mammalian genomes, which harbor large portion of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits. Interpreting the regulatory target genes of CRE and GWAS variants remains challenging, as majority of genes are not merely regulated by CREs in close one-dimensional (1D) vicinity. Instead, CREs can form DNA loops and regulate the expression of gene(s) from hundreds of kilobases (Kb) away. Thus, deep understanding of chromatin spatial organization can shed light on gene regulation and disease mechanisms. During the last decade, chromatin conformation capture (3C)-derived technologies (e.g., in situ Hi-C, capture Hi-C, ChIA-PET, PLAC-seq and HiChIP) have been widely used to provide a genome-wide view of chromatin spatial organization. However, these technologies are usually applied to bulk tissue or purified cell lines, and cannot reveal cell-type-specific chromatin interactome within complex tissues. Fortunately, harnessing the power of single cell technologies, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) and scHi-C-derived multi-modal assays, including single cell Methyl-HiC and single- nucleus methyl-3C, have been rapidly advanced to study chromatin interactome at single cell resolution, providing powerful tools to study chromatin spatial organization in complex tissues and disease relevant cell types. While great strides have been made in scHi-C experimental technologies, computational methods for analyzing scHi-C data are largely lagging behind. The methodological gaps fall mainly in three aspects: (1) Current methods are inefficient to enhance resolution from extremely sparse scHi-C data. (2) Few methods exist for removing systematic biases of scHi-C data within each cell, and adjusting for batch effect across different cells. (3) No method is available to detect Kb resolution cell-type-specific chromatin interactions from scHi-C data. To fill in these gaps, I propose major research directions: (1) develop deep learning-based methods to impute sparse chromatin contacts in each cell, (2) develop non-parametric regression models to remove systematic biases within each cell, and to adjust batch effects across different cells, (3) develop a hybrid approach based on both global and local background models to identify cell-type-specific chromatin interactions, and predict putative target genes of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits, and (4) develop stand-alone, user-friendly software packages to analyze single cell chromatin interactomic data and disseminate results. Completion of the proposed study will provide robust and user friendly computational methods that allow us to analyze 3D genome organization at single cell resolution and interpret their regulatory role on gene expression and complex human diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization (chromatin interactome) plays a critical role in genome function and gene regulation.

"Clinical Diagnostic Sequencing of Structural Variation ABSTRACT Emerging genomic medicine initiatives are poised to impact prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, including assessment of fetal structural anomalies (FSAs) from amniocentesis and the rapid adoption of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS). Indeed, the rapid decrease in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) costs and the improved sophistication of analytic genomics methods has brought prenatal screening to a critical inflection point. Ongoing studies find improved diagnostic yields from WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) over conventional karyotype and microarray (CMA); however, the technical, analytical, and interpretative challenges presented by structural variants (SVs) continue to confound sequence-based diagnostics. The field lacks standardized methods to interpret SVs from WGS and WES, yet these variants underlie a significant fraction of prenatal diagnoses, particularly for high risk fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). Our clinical SV program was initially formed to nucleate expertise in technology and algorithm development, variant interpretation, maternal-fetal medicine, and large-scale references to explore the impact of high-resolution SV detection in prenatal diagnostics. This resubmission builds upon the methods, resources, and discoveries from those studies to establish uniform approaches to jointly discover and interpret SVs, initially from amniocentesis and ultimately using non-invasive methods. We will focus on MCAs as exemplars of genomic diagnostics in severe clinical referrals. The discoveries from our initial funding period collectively suggest several critical advances could transform prenatal screening and genetic diagnostics, and we directly address three major barriers to these advances in this renewal: (1) Diagnostic yields from WES in FSAs are highly variable due to inconsistent methods and limited sensitivity to capture SVs. Aim 1 will benchmark diagnostic yields from WGS in MCA cases using our standardized open-source pipelines. (2) The genes contributing to the most severe fetal anomalies in humans remain largely unknown, as studies of MCAs have mostly been restricted to small cohorts and low-resolution CMA methods. Aim 2 will aggregate these severe fetal anomalies and perform uniform variant detection and joint association analyses of short variants and SVs from WES and WGS in FSA trios across multiple consortia, which we will compare to population-scale aggregated controls. (3) NIPS is ultra-low resolution and fails to capture most causal variant classes underlying MCAs. Aim 3 will benchmark an innovative approach to detect coding mutations and SVs from cffDNA, comparing yields to current NIPS and amniocentesis as the standard-of-care. Our team will thus leverage complementary expertise, novel methods, and unique patient resources to advance routine genomic screening in prenatal diagnostics. NARRATIVE This project brings together a team of experts in genetics, genomics, and maternal fetal medicine to introduce whole-genome sequencing as a viable first-tier diagnostic test for fetuses with severe structural anomalies detected on ultrasound. Our team will leverage novel methods for prenatal genetic testing of fetal samples from amniocentesis and excess tissue from the most severe extremes of fetal developmental anomalies in humans.

"Linking Variants to Multi-scale Phenotypes via a Synthesis of Subnetwork Inference and Deep Learning Project Summary The ability to accurately predict the effect of genetic variation on phenotypes at multiple scales would radically transform our ability to apply genomic technologies in order to understand human health and disease. This predictive ability would significantly improve the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of genomic analyses ranging from genome-wide association studies for common diseases to diagnostic odysseys searching for genetic causes of rare diseases. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a trainable approach for predicting the phenotypic impact of genetic variants. This approach will support predictions for a broad range of genetic variations, phenotypes, and biological contexts. It will incorporate and exploit mechanistic knowledge of pathways where available, but augment this pathway knowledge with learned models where it is not. This approach will consist of a synthesis of (i) methods that link genomic variants to their effect on expression or function of individual gene products, (ii) methods that link those relationships into the subnetworks involved in cellular responses of interest, (iii) machine-learning approaches that infer models pertaining to a variety of genotype-phenotype relations from large training sets. We will also develop and apply active learning algorithms to identify the most informative experiments for subsequent analysis by IGVF Consortium. Additionally, we will develop and apply a statistical framework for elucidating genetic modifiers, through probabilistic, network-informed inference of common variants identified in GWAS that modify the impact of rare variants implicated in sequencing-based association studies. Throughout the project, we will work closely with other IGVF Centers to guide experimental data collection, benchmark methods from across Centers, and contribute to the variant-element-phenotype catalog which will have broad applications by the community. Narrative Being able to characterize the impact of genetic variants on phenotypes is critical for interpreting the roles these variants play in human health and disease.

"Multi-ethnic high-throughput study to identify novel non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after blood and marrow transplantation Project Summary Blood and marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective cure for many life-threatening hematologic diseases. Survival after BMT has improved dramatically over the past two decades, however up to 40% of patients still die within one year after HLA-matched unrelated donor allogeneic BMT. This project will build upon our prior genome-wide (GWAS) and exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) involving ~2,900 patients named Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT (DISCOVeRY-BMT). Our GWAS identified several donor loci that significantly increased recipient’s risk of disease-related mortality (DRM) and donor-recipient genotype mismatches significantly increased risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) in European Americans (EAs). Our ExWAS discovered a rare nonsynonymous coding variant, where a donor-recipient genotype mismatch correlated with TRM and additional novel genes (e.g. TEX38, OR51D1, and NT5E) correlated with overall survival, TRM and DRM. Our goal for this proposal is two-fold: to deepen our understanding of non-HLA genetic contributors to BMT mortality, and to build the clinical-genomic prognostic models to translate such understanding into clinical practice. The first goal will be fulfilled in two directions. 1) We will systematically survey both rare and common variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and meta- GWAS in EAs as well as under-studied diverse populations in an effort to bridge the BMT survival disparity between EAs, African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Our prior ExWAS in EAs demonstrated the important roles played by rare coding variants in BMT mortality, however, only 2% of rare variants are in the exome array. Therefore, we will use WES to assay all exonic variants in 5,598 multi-ethnic donor-recipient pairs. As the variants/genes we identify are direct candidates for causality, functional validation will be performed to investigate such relationships. In parallel, we will perform the largest meta-GWAS of BMT mortality to date. Through our collaborations, we have assembled all BMT GWAS data available in the US (8,576 donor-recipient pairs including 1,978 minority pairs). 2) We will interrogate WES and GWAS data to further reveal the biological networks contributing to BMT mortality. To meet the second goal, we will leverage our unique and powerful GWAS resource to develop prognostic models to predict patients’ personalized mortality risk. This is the first study to use next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the contribution of non-HLA coding variants on post-BMT mortality. GWAS data on 8,576 donor-recipient pairs, of which 5,598 pairs also have WES data, will make this the largest genetic study ever undertaken, and provide a real opportunity to understand the genetics of BMT mortality across diverse populations. The prognostic models we develop will provide a valuable tool to help reduce BMT mortality and enhance donor-recipient matching in routine clinical practice. Importantly, the data generated by this project will be shared publicly to serve as a resource for additional research to improve survivorship after BMT and enhance the public investment in this project. Project Narrative This is the first study to use both next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association study data to analyze the contribution of non-HLA genetic variants to mortality after allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) for life-threatening hematologic cancers.

Accurately diagnosing patients with LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in the majority of cases can only be done in presymptomatic cases through genetic testing. When a new DNA variant in one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible missense variant in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes to advance our understanding of sarcoglycan biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the SGC genes, and advance LGMD care and treatments. We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. We will express a library of all possible SGC missense variants in cultured human cells and measure the effect of each by exploiting a simple but robust characteristic of pathogenic SGC gene variants, disruption of proper protein trafficking. Our two aims are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible SGC missense variant on SGC protein trafficking and membrane localization, and 2) Predict and validate the pathogenicity of every possible SGC missense variant by integrating multiple functional assays from Aim 1 to create a pathogenicity score for each variant and by confirming variant predictions biochemically using tissue samples from LGMD patients with VUS. These aims will reveal how each possible missense variant in SGC genes impact expression, transport, function or interaction with other SGC proteins. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of SGC variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand sarcoglycan biology, improve the clinical translation of sarcoglycanopathies and LGMD using genetic information, and inform new treatments. The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in a subset of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the sarcoglycan genes SGCA, SGCB, SGCD and SGCG. We propose to use an integrated experimental and computational approach that combines multiple high-throughput assays of protein trafficking and function and machine-learning to generate pathogenicity predictions for all possible single- nucleotide variants in these SGC genes and then to validate our predictions in primary tissue samples from patients with SGC variants.",Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes,10193457,R21AR078942,"['Archives ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saliva ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' gamma Sarcoglycan ', ' γ-Sarcoglycan ', ' Therapeutic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' δ-Sarcoglycan ', ' delta Sarcoglycan ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' protein transport ', ' limb-girdle muscular weakness and atrophy ', ' limb-girdle syndrome ', ' myopathic limb-girdle syndrome ', ' Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' GUCY ', ' Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase ', ' nitric oxide receptor ', ' nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase ', ' sGC protein ', ' Soluble Guanylate Cyclase ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Sarcoglycans ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' protein function ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' clinical translation ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ClinVar ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,207900

"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens ABSTRACT  Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell- type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the 3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified in genome-wide association studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will take an integrative approach involving generating a 4D atlas of regulatory interactions during both development and disease progressions, computationally nominating diabetes-relevant β cell enhancers through integrative analysis and discovering functional enhancers through large-scale perturbation screens. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks that instruct the β cell fate and function during development and in diabetic conditions.","Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens",10264095,U01DK128852,"['Adult ', ' 21+

"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10251159,R35HG011279,"['Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Genetic ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Base Pairing ', ' novel ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' human disease ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' genome annotation ', ' epigenome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,439299
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,10387065,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Physiology ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Capillary Electrophoresis ', ' Capillary Electrophoresis Fractionation ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Thyroid Gland Carcinoma ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Thyroid carcinoma ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Transcript ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' deep learning ', ' feature detection ', ' feature recognition ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,45639
"The impact of genomic variation on environment-induced changes in pancreatic beta cell states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin in order to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretion is tightly regulated by glucose and modulated by numerous environmental signals, including other nutrients, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of beta cells to environmental signals affects gene regulatory programs within hours, and these signal-dependent changes serve to adapt insulin secretion to changes in organismal states. Genetic variants associated with measures of insulin secretion are strongly enriched in genomic elements active in beta cells, and many of these variants are also associated with risk of diabetes. Beta cells therefore possess characteristics that make them an ideal cellular model for studying signal-dependent gene regulatory processes relevant to human health and disease. However, the specific genomic programs that drive signal- induced state changes in beta cells remain poorly characterized. Recent advances in the development of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multi-cellular islet organoid models by us and others provide a genetically tractable beta cell model for linking genomic activity to cellular phenotypes. Our group has further pioneered the development of numerous single cell assays, including chromatin accessibility, ultra-high-throughput paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and paired 3D chromatin interactions and DNA methylation; methods that we have successfully applied to both primary human islets and hPSC-islet organoids. We have further developed machine learning and network-based approaches for variant interpretation including from single cell RNA and epigenetic data. In this proposal we will develop novel gene regulatory network (GRN) models to predict network-level relationships among genomic elements, genes, and phenotypes derived from single cell multiomic maps charting signal- and time-dependent changes in hPSC-islet organoids. In Sections B and C we will measure genomic element activity, gene expression, and insulin secretion in hPSC-islet organoids exposed to ten different secretory signals each across four time points using paired single nucleus accessible chromatin and gene expression and paired single cell DNA methylation and 3D chromatin architecture assays. In Section D we will generate a GRN from these data, use machine learning to infer element-gene and element-phenotype relationships and use the trained models to refine the GRN. From the resulting GRN we will predict the effects of genetic variants in specific genomic elements on target gene expression, gene network activity, and cellular phenotype. In Section E we will validate and refine models by using medium-scale CRISPR interference of genomic elements individually and in combination as well as allele-specific gene editing of selected glucose-associated variants in hPSC-islet organoids and measuring gene expression changes in cis and trans. Together, the results, data, and methods from this project using a model of a cell type which both rapidly responds to environmental signals and has a quantifiable phenotypic output will be widely applicable to the community studying the dynamics of genomic regulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fine-tuned regulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta cells in response to environmental signals is critical for human health and survival. Our proposal will apply systematic, single cell-resolved multiomic data collection in human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet organoids exposed to secretory signals to predict and validate

"Comprehensive characterization of variants underlying heart and blood diseases with CRISPR base editing Project Summary How genomic variation influences cellular function is a fundamental problem with tremendous importance for human disease. While it has traditionally been difficult to study the effects of specific sequence variants in an experimentally controlled manner, precise genome editing technologies such as CRISPR base editing enable “writing” of trait-associated variants to cells to unravel their function. In this proposal, we will perform multi-modal genome editing-based functional characterization of a total of 72,000 genomic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and hematological traits. CVD and blood traits are uniquely suited to functional dissection because cardiovascular (coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia) and blood traits have among the best-powered multi-ethnic GWAS of any traits, and a substantial component of trait variability can be captured in cellular assays that can be scaled to perform high-throughput screening. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of world-class experts to provide a generalizable pipeline to unravel the functional impact of CVD and blood trait variants by integrating: (1) rich and ancestry-diverse human genetic discoveries, (2) broadly targetable CRISPR base editors and efficient delivery to primary human cells, (3) high-content assays to profile phenotypes at the levels of chromatin, gene expression and cellular function, and (4) computational methods to design, interpret, visualize, and share experimental results. In Aim 1, we will employ a robust, three-tiered variant prioritization scheme that incorporates evidence for disease association from large, multi-ethnic GWAS as well as probability of causality to nominate variants for functional assessment. Through this scheme, we will select variants associated with red blood cell and neutrophil traits, coronary artery disease, blood pressure, and HDL and LDL cholesterol that span a range of allelic frequencies and likely causality to test in high-throughput cellular assays. In Aim 2, we will perform systematic cellular phenotype-based screens using base editors to install candidate variants as well as CRISPR epigenetic inhibition and activation to explore variant-containing regulatory elements. We will use eight established, scalable cellular phenotypic readouts, each of which will enable us to assess which of 12,000 variants and variant-centered elements alter CVD and blood trait-associated cellular phenotypes. We will additionally employ a high-throughput, genome-integrated chromatin accessibility assay to assess which variants alter chromatin accessibility in trait-relevant cell lines. We will follow up with targeted single cell RNA-seq of 5,600 variants in primary cells from donors of different sex and ethnicity. In Aim 3, we will produce a catalog of validated variants and their association with phenotypes for each of the proposed screens. We will collaborate with other IGVF groups to utilize these data to optimize models that predict functional variants, regulatory elements and disease-causing biological mechanisms, ultimately leading to more complete understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular and blood disease risk. Project Narrative Genetic variation dictates an individual’s risk of developing common ailments such as heart and blood diseases. Traditionally, it has been difficult to determine which of the millions of sequence variants influence disease susceptibility due to a lack of technologies that enable the causal assignment of genetic variants at scale. To address this unmet need, we will develop a generalizable pipeline that leverages technological breakthroughs in precise genome editing to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation on heart and blood disease risk, offering a rich catalog of the consequences of thousands of disease-associated variants that will be of broad utility to the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF)

"Linking genome variation to transcriptional network dynamics in human B cells B cells of the immune system are a leading model for the analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cell type specific transcriptional control mechanisms. They represent a featured mammalian cell state in the ENCODE project for in depth chromatin and transcription factor profiling. Furthermore, the loci encoding the antibody heavy and light chain genes (IgH and IgL) have been used to uncover novel mechanisms of somatic DNA recombination and hypermutation that enable the generation of highly diverse antibody repertoires and affinity maturation in response to pathogen encounters or vaccines. Importantly, variation in the human B cell regulatory genome has been associated with autoimmune diseases and vaccine responses. In spite of these impressive advances, there has not been a comprehensive attempt to delineate the cis-regulome of primary human B cells in their resting, activated and terminally differentiated states or to assemble a signaling induced gene regulatory network that controls the activation dynamics and differentiation of B cells. This has impeded efforts to systematically analyze the consequences of genomic variation on the structure and temporal dynamics of the underlying B cell regulatory network in human health and disease. Based on our success in assembling the first comprehensive cis-regulome for primary murine B cells by coupling structural and functional genomics, an inter-disciplinary team is proposing to address the two major challenges highlighted above for human B cells. Thus, we hope to advance a generalizable framework for analyzing the causal connections between human genome variation and dynamic gene network regulation in diverse biological contexts.

In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders. Project Narrative: This proposal takes integrative approaches to prioritizing genes and noncoding variants underlying psychiatric disorders through better leveraging functional genomic resources to predict their biological relevance. The identification and characterization of potential causal genes would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment.",Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders,10233995,R01MH121394,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', '

"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development. Project Narrative The proposed study is to conduct a large scale genomic discovery of recurrent pregnancy loss using an integrated and innovative genomics approach and construct an intolerome to guide the evaluation of pregnancy loss in clinic and studies of the human early development.",Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss,10226657,R01HD105267,"['Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conceptions ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fathers ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Mothers ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Siblings ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Sample Size ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Reproductive Medicine ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' grandparent ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Mouse Cell Line ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Short Tandem Repeat ', ' Simple Sequence Repeat ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' genomic variation ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' Data Science ', ' Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic predictors ', ' recruit ', ' genetic architecture ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' variant detection ', ' human pangenome ', ' pan-human genome ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1524247
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Production ', ' Recommendation ', ' Retina ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cell engineering ', ' cellular engineering ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' synthetic biology ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage

"Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells PROJECT SUMMARY Many non-Mendelian (polygenic) human genetic diseases involve multiple causal loci in noncoding regions of the genome, implicating mutations in regulatory elements rather than protein-coding genes as the cause of these diseases. Deciphering the etiology of these human genetic diseases requires an understanding of how genes are regulated during development and homeostasis to produce functional cell states. This regulation is encoded both through epigenetic chromatin state, and genetically encoded in the DNA sequence of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators. However, these regulatory elements and their activity states in human cells are not resolvable with current technologies. As aberrant gene regulation likely underlies many human diseases, understanding (1) the function of regulatory DNA elements and (2) their activity dynamics during healthy human development are essential. To address these two problems, I propose to: (i) develop new experimental methods to profile multimodal chromatin state in single cells; (ii) identify alterations in regulatory element activation states that guide cell fate choice during human hematopoiesis; (iii) identify the DNA sequence features important for regulatory element function; (iv) build community tools and resources for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Together these aims will provide methods and resources for the interrogation of the human functional genome, and the identification of regulatory state dynamics that generate human cell types. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional training supported by co-mentors Dr. Rahul Satija (single-cell biology), Dr. Vijay Sankaran (hematopoiesis), Dr. Danny Reinberg (gene regulation), and Dr. David Knowles (machine learning). I have developed a 5-year career development plan that integrates scientific training in hematopoiesis and gene regulation, practical training and mentorship in deep learning, extensive leadership training through courses and mentorship, and seminars and workshops on academic writing. My team of scientific mentors will provide further guidance and mentorship in academic job searches. The New York Genome Center is an ideal environment for research and further career development, providing the cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment. Completion of the proposed research program and career development plan will launch my independent scientific career as a leader in the field of single-cell epigenomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Information in the human genome encodes a multitude of functional cell states. How this information is decoded to produce these states, and how aberrant encodings produce aberrant states, is not well known. This project aims to develop a suite of experimental and computational methods to identify the changes in regulatory states that occur during hematopoiesis and predict how changes to the genome sequence may impact healthy human development.",Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells,10106155,K99HG011489,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications.

"New quantitative approaches to interpret variant pathogenicity Project Summary Insufficient knowledge and throughput to interpret pathogenicity of genetic variants identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) is a major bottleneck for genomic medicine implementation. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines identify high-confidence pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but are limited in scalability. Many variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance by the ACMG/AMP guidelines without an indication of which of these variants are more or less likely to be pathogenic, leading to inappropriate medical treatment. Hence, I propose to develop standardized quantitative approaches to improve our ability to interpret genomic variations accurately at high-throughput. In-silico tools are commonly used to assign variant pathogenicity based on conservation, but their predictive accuracy is limited. The current methods have not been calibrated across genes, and the same pathogenicity score does not infer the same likelihood of pathogenicity across different genes. In this proposal, 1) I aim to recalibrate the pathogenicity scores incorporating gene-specific features making the pathogenicity scores more comparable across genes, and improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions using advanced deep neural network models and functional data from saturation mutagenesis studies. 2) I aim to quantify the ACMG/AMP variant classification and provide probability of variant pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes using advanced supervised learning and leveraging a large case- control cohort. The improved computational predictions (Aim 1) will refine variant prioritization for downstream analyses and strengthen the computational evidence used in the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The estimated probability of variant pathogenicity based on ACMG/AMP guideline (Aim 2) will improve communication between laboratories, health care providers and patients about genetic test results.

"Genomic control of gene regulatory networks governing early human lineage decisions ABSTRACT  Predicting the impact of genomic variation requires quantitative modeling to deconstruct the interplay between multiple individual variants and to determine their combined effects on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control cell state and cell function. We focus on the GRNs that control early human development as a paradigm. Arguably the most important lineage decision during mammalian development is the decision of epiblast cells to exit the pluripotent state (a state when the cells have the potential to give rise to all somatic cells and germ cells), and differentiate into one of the three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. This pluripotent state and the trilineage differentiation can be captured using cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Much attention has focused on the GRNs underlying the maintenance of the self-renewing pluripotent state, but the GRNs governing hESC trilineage differentiation remain largely unexplored. We previously conducted genome-scale CRISPR/Cas screens to discover protein-coding genes that regulate the transition of hESCs to definitive endoderm. Based on the genomic and genetic data and machine learning (gkm-SVM sequence analysis), we expanded our initial simple two transcription factor (TF) model to a multiple TF cooperative model. Here we propose an integrative approach examining the hESC transition to definitive endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm germ layer identities to improve the generalizability of GRN models. We will perform quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution. These quantitative measurements will be combined with perturbation of key GRN elements, core TFs and their target enhancers, to inform the generation of dynamic GRN models. To further improve the precision of our new GRN models, we will map cell trajectories during state transitions through lineage tracing combined with scRNA-seq. Beyond hESC guided differentiation, the physiological relevance of enhancers will be further interrogated in human and mouse organoids (gastruloids) and mouse embryos. We will then apply innovative new computational and algorithmic methods to our multimodal experimental data to generate GRN models, aiming to learn generalizable principles underlying the contribution of genomic variants to cellular and ultimately organismal phenotypes. Developing GRN models for the exit of pluripotency and the acquisition of germ layer identities involves dynamic modeling of the cell state transition, which will not only inform our understanding of early human development, but can also serve as the basis for construction of generalizable GRN models for biological transitions during embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration as well as inappropriate cell fate transitions that occur in pathological conditions such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will construct models of gene regulatory networks controlling early human development by taking an integrative approach involving perturbation of core regulatory network elements, quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high temporal and single-cell resolution, and systems level analyses. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks during cell state transitions, and reveal general features of genomic variants that

"Predictive Modeling of the Functional and Phenotypic Impacts of Genetic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated tens of thousands of common variants with human diseases and traits. The rapid expansion of Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks offer great potential to understand the physiologic and pathophysiologic associations of both common and rare variants. The IGVF Consortium aims to systematically study the functional and phenotypic effects of genomic variation; it is not, however, feasible to experimentally characterize the vast number of candidate variants of interest. Computational models which can accurately predict the context-specific effects of variants are essential in designing targeted research. We propose an approach anchored on a framework of high-confidence regulatory elements (REs), from which we will develop methods to learn RE-gene links, perform rare variant association tests, and finemap causal common and rare variants. We aim to make all our results, methods, and tools available to the community through a public portal and the NHGRI and NHLBI Data Commons. Our proposal has four aims: (1) Develop a core framework of REs from open chromatin regions on which to anchor our models, improving on past approaches by producing higher-resolution predictions of functional base-pairs, producing novel RE subclassifications using functional characterization datasets from IGVF and other sources, and harnessing single-cell datasets to delineate lineage- and stimulus-specific elements. (2) Use this framework to predict the roles of variants in molecular phenotypes, specifically gene expression and cellular response to stimuli. We will build statistical and machine-learning methods to predict context-specific links between REs and their target genes, using three-dimensional conformation data produced by the IGVF Consortium and external sources. We will apply this method across many cell types and perform feature selection to build a catalog of high-confidence RE-gene links and regulatory networks. (3) Develop statistical methods to perform cell type-specific rare variant association tests (cellSTAAR) in WGS studies, and a latent variable model to prioritize candidate functional variants for traits and diseases, using results from Aims 1 and 2. We will apply these methods to analyze various metabolic, immune-mediated, and psychiatric disorders in the multi-ethnic WGS data of the NHLBI Trans-Omic Precision Medicine Program (TOPMed) and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) to identify candidate causal disease-associated variants. (4) Make all the results publicly available by substantially expanding the FAVOR Portal to include whole genome variant functional annotations of all three billion genomic positions as well as cell type-specific annotations. We will implement both FAVOR and cellSTAAR in the Data Commons AnVIL (NHGRI) and BioData Catalyst (NHLBI) so researchers may use them for analysis of new datasets in a scalable cloud computing environment. We will work closely with other centers and the Data Analysis Coordinating Center (DACC) of the IGVF on joint analyses and building the IGVF Variant Catalog. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists have been pinpointing tens of thousands of positions in the human genome which may influence disease.

"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets.

"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Identifying causal genetic variants in mental health disease is a major challenge limiting interpretation of disease biology, prediction of risk and development of therapies.

"Integrating primate-rodent cell types and epigenomics to identify conservation in substance addiction Project Summary/Abstract Substance use disorders (SUD) of many highly addictive drugs affect more than 100 million people worldwide. Genetic variations associated with complex neuro-behavioral traits, such as drug addiction, are likely to impact enhancers which have a high degree of cell type-specificity and can be conserved across species. Furthermore, variation in addiction behavior has been linked to genetic variation in both human and rodents. Thus, it follows that genetic mechanisms driving addiction behavior, specifically at cell type-specific enhancers, might also be conserved between primates and rodents. I hypothesize that risk variants for some SUDs may lie in enhancers of distinct cell types in the reward areas and not others, providing insight into the cell types that are critical to SUDs. This project proposes to identify the gene markers and putative enhancers of cell types that are conserved or clade-specific to primates and rodents and of these, which are enriched for SUD human genetic risk variants. The proposal comprises of the following aims: Aim 1: identify the primate-rodent conserved cell types and marker gene profiles enriched for human SUD risk variants. Aim 2: identify the primate-rodent conserved putative enhancer profiles to test whether mouse substance use behavior risk loci disrupt similar putative conserved enhancers to human SUD risk loci. Together, these experiments could reveal primate-rodent gene and enhancer atlas of conserved and species-specific cell types of the reward system by integrating single-nuclei genomics data across multiple mammalian species. This information is critically important because better understanding of how an individual’s genetic makeup could affect the cells of the reward circuit will inform future work to craft personalized, targeted SUD therapy. Thus, this work integrates closely with my clinical interests in addiction medicine. This proposal outlines a combination of rigorous mentored research training, longitudinal clinical experiences, coursework, and professional and leadership development activities. The intellectual, technical, and professional skills refined during this fellowship training period will be instrumental in my development as an aspiring physician scientist in the clinical field of addiction medicine. Project Narrative Substance use disorders affect more than 100 million people worldwide and are influenced by the genetic makeup of the individual, in humans as well as rodent models. In this proposal, I will investigate how genetic differences in humans and mice could influence sets of brain cell types shared across human, monkey, and rodents. These results will provide a foundation to link the power of rodent models to specific features of SUDs in humans.",Integrating primate-rodent cell types and epigenomics to identify conservation in substance addiction,10143371,F30DA053020,"['Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Monkeys ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Small Nuclear RNA ', ' Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA ', ' Small Molecular Weight RNA ', ' snRNA ', ' uRNA ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Specificity ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Dopamine D1 Receptor ', ' D1 receptor ', ' Transposase ', ' Enhancers ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Comparative Genomic Analysis ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' leadership development ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mouse genetics ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"REDfly: The regulatory sequence resource for Drosophila and other insects We have developed a unique resource, the REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database of transcriptional regulatory elements, to provide regulatory annotation for the genome of Drosophila and other insects. The genomic sequences regulating gene expression—transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, e.g. “enhancers”) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)—are not currently curated by any other major database resources. This is a serious deficiency as CRMs play critical roles with respect to birth defects and chronic diseases as well as normal development, phenotypic variation, and evolution. Knowledge of experimentally validated CRMs and TFBSs is vital for many areas of research including interpretation and validation of data developed by large-scale genomics projects, providing training data for machine-learning CRM- discovery methods, genome annotation, modeling gene regulatory networks, studying the evolution of gene regulation, and numerous aspects of the basic biology of transcriptional regulation. Knowledge of insect CRMs is also an important step in developing biotechnology methods for control of insect disease vectors and for eliminating pathogen transmission. REDfly includes experimentally verified CRMs and TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the expression patterns they direct. It is the most detailed existing platform for metazoan regulatory element annotation and is widely acknowledged as the premier resource in the regulatory genomics arena. Only REDfly integrates all of the available insect cis-regulatory information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive collection of regulatory elements. The objectives of this proposal are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being identified and to update the REDfly site to maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will continue to be kept up-to-date as new studies are published, and valuable data and metadata will be added to existing records. (2) User interface. We will develop more sophisticated search, display, and download capabilities to keep pace with the vastly increased amounts and types of data now contained in the database. We will update software components that have become obsolete in the decade since their initial implementation. (3) Data integration. We will increase integration of disparate data types and develop confidence scores for annotations. (4) Workflow. We will increase our curation efficiency and ability through improved workflows. (5) Ontology support. We will improve how we use biomedical ontologies through incorporating the latest ontology- related software, including ontology browsers and SPARQL queries. The proposed activities are significant as they will keep up-to-date a high-value resource for multiple research communities and increase REDfly’s utility by adding needed new features and functions. REDfly has already demonstrated its essential and unique value as an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research in multiple research areas. It will have greatly increased impact through the updates and enhancements proposed here.

"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive

"Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome A person’s genome typically contains millions of genetic variants. Understanding these variants by assessing their functional impact on a person’s phenotype, is currently of great interest in human genetics and precision medicine. Though Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) studies have successfully identified variants associated with traits or molecular phenotypes, most of them are in noncoding regions and hampered by linkage disequilibrium, making the identification and interpretation of casual variants difficult. Moreover, most of these discoveries are common variants, however, rare and individual-specific variants in personal genome are underexplored. Understanding these variants will not only explain the missing heritability from GWAS but also improve the precision medicine. Recently, the advent and popularity of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and paired multi-omics functional assays provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify rare and individual-specific casual variants. However, the sample sizes of most WGS studies are modest compared to GWAS, making the WGS analysis particularly challenging. Nevertheless, statistical and computational methods for analyzing WGS are underdeveloped. Given these challenges and my unique multi- disciplinary training, the overall goals of my research program are to develop a novel class of machine learning, statistical and system biology approaches for the identification, prioritization and interpretation of noncoding variants by integrating GWAS, WGS and multi-omics functional assays, which will empower precision medicine by identifying individualized biomarkers for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, in the next five years, my lab will (i) develop a novel transfer learning approach to improve the prediction of noncoding casual variants using multi-dimensional omics features (ii) develop a multi-omics integrated omnibus scan test to improve the identification of rare casual variants from whole-genome sequencing data (iii) develop an integrative computational framework for scoring impact of noncoding variants in personal genome (iv) develop a novel class of multi-trait methods to improve phenotype prediction using whole-genome genetic variations. In the meantime, supported by Indiana University Precision Health Initiative, we will apply the methodologies to different studies from Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Center and Indiana Multiple Myeloma Biobank for novel scientific findings. We will work close with collaborated geneticists and clinician-scientists to interpret the discoveries. Importantly, we will work with experimental labs to validate the findings. In line with our previous work, we will continue to make all developed methods into open-source software tools that are accessible and useful to the biomedical research community.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['Pathogenesis ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' embryonic loss ', ' Embryo Loss ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Genetics ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' oral epithelium ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' orofacial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' model building ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' support vector machine ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Epidermis ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nasal cavity ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' CDH1 ', ' CDHE ', ' LCAM ', ' CDH1 gene ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,10153859,K99HG011041,"['genomic science ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' pressure ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' human population genetics ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Differentiation ', ' Genetic Divergence ', ' Genetic Drift ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' biological systems ', ' genomic variation ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genome sciences ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,132244
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk.

"Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY Leveraging the power of the human genome to understand the risks, causes, and treatments of human dis- ease remains a grand challenge for all of biology and medicine. While sequencing costs have plummeted, and clinical implementation has become commonplace, interpreting human genomes remains a highly challenging task. It is our hypothesis that understanding the function of the genome and its products at a molecular, tissue, and phenotypic level using advanced machine learning will help unlock the door to better interpretation for sci- entific discovery and better clinical outcomes based on genomic medicine. To that end, our team has spent the past two decades working to develop computational models of biology, to predict how those models are perturbed through changes in the genome, and to use those perturbations to model phenotype and disease. We have had many research outputs in this area, having developed and published a number of widely used methods that predict biochemical and phenotypic changes caused by genetic variants to infer phenotype and pathogenicity. However, we believe that there is a coming convergence between the variability in clinical inter- pretation, high-throughput biotechnology assays, and modern machine learning methodology that will result in more accurate clinical assessments and improved clinical care. Therefore, in this ambitious proposal, we are addressing important questions in variant and genome interpretation consistent with this view and the mission of the IGVF Consortium. Our major goals include (1) developing advanced semi-supervised approaches to predict variants that disrupt molecular function and/or are capable of altering phenotypes; (2) identifying in- formative assays, variants, and genes to automate experimental design with an emphasis on resource alloca- tion and reduction of ascertainment bias in the Consortium; and (3) developing machine learning approaches to integrate these models into a workflow of the IGVF Consortium and enable the interaction between compu- tation and experiment in order to catalyze advances in both genetic variant interpretation and predictive model development. PROJECT NARRATIVE We are developing advanced machine learning approaches and tools for understanding the link between mo- lecular function and phenotype and to guide experimental data collection within the IGVF Consortium. These tools will assist in determining whether and how the observed differences on a human genome give rise to a risk of a disease or other condition of clinical interest. Our methods are distributable on the internet and will be made widely available.","Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning",10297060,U01HG012022,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Paper ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' assay development ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' model development ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' clinical care ', ' biological systems ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' genomic variation ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical implementation ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHGRI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,356264
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Veterans ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Resequencing ', ' DNA Resequencing ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' genetic architecture ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord mediated largely by pathogenic T cell responses to myelin antigens, resulting in demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin-reactive T cells are also crucial for induction of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Studies of MS and EAE implicate CD4 T helper (Th) cells in disease pathogenesis, including pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells. In this regard, the disease-promoting ability of these T cell subsets stems from both their capacity to target and infiltrate the CNS and their pro-inflammatory effector function. An interplay between genetic and environmental factors is implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. However, despite a wealth of genome wide association data (GWAS) data revealing a strong genetic contribution to MS, it has been challenging to identify the bona fide disease-promoting gene target(s) of many risk-associated variants, and the cellular compartment in which they contribute to dysregulation. In preliminary work, we have applied global genomics approaches to map MS-associated noncoding risk variants to their long-range target gene by physically capturing enhancer-promoter interactions. These MS-implicated genes were further prioritized based on dysregulated expression signatures in pathogenic Th17 cells derived from MS patients. Using this approach, we have identified putative regulatory MS variants and gene targets that control CD4 T cell function in MS that are the basis of this application. We hypothesize that identifying noncoding variants that alter the regulatory function of cis elements controlling proinflammatory T cells will provide novel mechanistic insights into the underlying etiology governing the development of MS. Here, we propose an integrative strategy to prioritize and validate causal genetic variants in MS pathogenesis. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the contribution of noncoding risk variants to CD4 T cell gene regulation. In particular, we will employ a combination of high-throughput regulatory reporter assays and machine learning approaches to identify SNPs with regulatory function in primary human CD4 T cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which these regulatory variants contribute to altered T cell function and pathogenicity in MS. Complementary CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic and epigenetic perturbations will define the enhancer context of risk alleles and delineate bona fide regulatory gene targets of regulatory risk variants. Moving from genotype to phenotype, we will define true causal variants that contribute to disease etiology in the context of an intact immune system using genetic interventions that model conserved risk variants in mice. Together, the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the both the genetic and cellular mechanisms governing Th17 cell pathogenicity in MS and discover new loci with unknown functions in disease etiology. Relevance Statement Recent years have witnessed an explosion of information derived from genome wide association studies (GWAS) linking genetic variation with increased risk for diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To date, little mechanistic insight has been gleaned from the majority of risk-associated variants, a challenge reflecting their primary localization to non-coding regulatory regions of the genome. The proposed work will capitalize on emerging genomics approaches to prioritize lineage-relevant MS risk variants, determine their mechanism of action in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS, and as such, provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting MS.",Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis,10298904,R01AI156186,"['Antigens ', '

"Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and bipolar disorders (BD) are remarkably common, with SZ alone affecting nearly three million Americans. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist for these conditions and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that, in addition to highly penetrant rare mutations, NPD risk also reflects the impact of hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting these genetic variants (the vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes. To understand how these myriad risk loci causally contribute to disease risk, it is essential to screen for putatively causal variant(s) and determine how they influence gene expression, which has been shown to be cell-type specific, as well as cellular function. Recent evidence has emerged indicating a substantial contribution of RNA splicing variation to heritability across many complex genetic diseases, including SZ. Based on our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that a substantial proportion of NPD GWAS loci exert their pathogenic effects on neuronal function by impacting RNA: its structure, modifications, protein interactions and splicing. To test this, we will apply novel tools and machine learning methods to predict and quantify RNA splicing in the largest SZ, ASD and BD GWAS, in order to predict splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs, Aim 1). To confirm true effects on exon inclusion independently in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (i.e., the major cell-types impacted in NPD), up to several thousand of the predicted splice variants will be tested by a massively parallel reporter assay, MaPSy (Aim 2). Finally, in order to evaluate the cell-type-specific impact of putative causal sQTLs identified in Aims 1 and 2 on neuronal maturation and synaptic function, we will use CRISPR gene editing to engineer these mutations within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of both neural cell types (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to map and functionally evaluate the NPD-GWAS loci that impact alternative splicing and neuronal function. Our work may impact the field by delivering new insights into the role of common variants in NPD pathophysiology, which could inform ways of improving diagnostics, predicting clinical trajectories, and developing novel therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The causal role of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants putatively involved in RNA splicing on neuronal function has not been fully explored. By combining genetic fine-mapping, machine learning methods, massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR-genetic engineering, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models, we propose to discover neuropsychiatric risk alleles predicted to impact alternative splicing and empirically test their molecular and functional impact in neurons. By better understanding the role of common variants in disease risk, we hope to improve diagnostics, predict clinical trajectories and develop novel therapeutic interventions.",Fine-mapping

"Functional Genetics Approaches to Investigate Human Evolution Analyses of human and chimpanzee genomes have catalogued the single-nucleotide and structural variants that have emerged since humans diverged from nonhuman primates. Nearly all of these genetic variants remain functionally uncharacterized. Contained within these genetic variants are alterations to cis-regulatory elements, protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs, gene copy number, repetitive elements, and other genomic features that underlie phenotypic differences between humans and nonhuman primates. Because it is difficult to predict how genomic differences within the hominid lineage contribute to phenotypic differences, there is a critical need for high-throughput, systematic approaches to interrogate functional genetic variation. Therefore, I seek to develop a quantitative genome-scale platform for identifying the phenotypic consequences of human-specific evolutionary mutations at a cellular and molecular level. To accomplish this objective, I will combine advances in chimpanzee pluripotent stem cell-derived models with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq). This project is of great  public health relevance because it will use genetic and molecular techniques to link evolved human-specific genetic variants to key cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, differentiation, gene expression, and chromatin state regulation. In Aim 1, I will functionally investigate thousands of human-specific deletions (hDels), structural variants that are lost in the human lineage, using a genome-scale CRISPRi screening approach in chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). I hypothesize that hDels contain celltype specific cis-regulatory elements that modify robust cellular proliferation. In Aim 2, I will map cis-regulatory elements contained within hDels to their target genes using scATAC-seq of embryonic rhesus macaque telencephalon followed by CRISPRi and scRNA-seq in chimpanzee NPCs. I hypothesize that hDel-containing cis-regulatory elements control genes involved in cellular division, apoptosis, and migration. In addition to Dr. Pollen’s expertise in comparative genomics and single-cell transcriptomics and Dr. Katherine Pollard’s expertise in theoretical population genetics and machine learning, our ongoing local collaborations with Dr. Martin Kampmann (CRISPR-Cas systems), Dr. Hani Goodarzi (computational and statistical methods), and Dr. Nadav Ahituv (cis-regulatory evolution), support the feasibility of this project. Evaluating the cellular and transcriptional consequences of perturbing human-specific genetic variants will reveal functional sequences that may have contributed to human evolution.",Functional Genetics Approaches to Investigate Human Evolution,10315626,F31HG011569,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hominidae ', ' Hominids ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pollen ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' statistics ', ' Telencephalon ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Gene Dosage ', ' Gene Copy Number ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Scientist ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' experience ', ' stable cell line ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Neural Stem Cell ', ' neural precursor ', ' neural precursor cell ', ' neural progenitor ', ' neural progenitor cells ', ' neuron progenitors ', ' neuronal progenitor ', ' neuronal progenitor cells ', ' neuronal stem cells ', ' neuroprogenitor ', ' nerve stem cell ', ' ATAC ', ' LPTN ', ' SCM-1 ', ' SCM-1a ', ' SCM1 ', ' SCYC1 ', ' XCL1 ', ' XCL1 gene ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' migration ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' loss of function ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' genomic predictors ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' stem cell model ', ' stem cell based model ', ' stem cell derived model ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2021,43401
"Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer Abstract A few germline pathogenic structural variants (SV) have been identified in cancer predisposition syndromes, e.g., MSH2 inversion in Lynch syndrome. The advent of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the detection of SVs. However, a pitfall of this sequencing methodology is the inability to capture all SVs, given the reads do not map well to low complexity regions, and current algorithms used to identify SVs from short-read data have very low sensitivity and very high false-positive rates. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to optimize and implement an SV calling pipeline that utilizes multiple algorithms to increase the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification from germline short-read WGS trios. This pipeline is currently being developed and tested on pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the NIH-funded Baylor Advancing Sequencing into Childhood Cancer Care (BASIC3) exome study, which consists of ethnically and racially diverse pediatric patients with solid (CNS and non-CNS) tumors. This BASIC3 subset includes 63 proband/parent trios who have subsequently undergone germline short-read WGS. Five SV callers are run and then filtered using either a percent reciprocal overlap filter or a proposed Artificial Intelligence-based proximity graph filter to identify de novo and inherited SVs. This cohort has recently been selected for a long-read sequencing pilot, data which serves as the gold standard for SV detection. Comparison of short-read WGS generated SV calls with the long- read data will help determine the sensitivity and specificity of variant calls and further improve the short read pipeline (Aim 1A). Once optimized this short-read WGS SV pipeline will be applied to the Kids First Genetics of Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma cohort (n=900), as an independent assessment of the method and also to identify recurrent germline SVs in this cancer which has not yet been well characterized (Aim 1B). The second training and scientific objective is to explore the functional effect of a novel de novo SV identified through the initial analysis. A de novo germline duplication of the Prostaglandin Reductase 2 (PTGR2) enhancer and promoter region was found in a pediatric Posterior Fossa subtype A (PF–A) ependymoma patient. Transcriptome data from the patient’s tumor revealed increased PTGR2 expression. The PTGR2 protein converts 15-keto- prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGE2. Studies in adult malignancies suggest that increased 15-keto- 13,14-dihydro-PGE2 is associated with cancer risk potentially through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Increased STAT3 signaling is reported as a distinct feature of PF-A ependymoma. The identified partial duplication of PTGR2 will be engineered into ependymoma progenitor cells, to functionally assess the effects on STAT3 signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis. In parallel, further analysis of PTGR2 expression and structural variants will be analyzed in pediatric ependymoma cohorts (Aim 2). Completion of this experimental plan and described training activities under Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic will provide Owen Hirschi highly interdisciplinary training in analysis of genomic data, structural variation, and the downstream effects on pediatric cancer biology. Project Narrative Structural variation occurring in the germline of pediatric patients is linked to cancer-predisposition, however the tools used to identify these events from short-read whole genome sequencing are often erroneous and limited. This project will seek to optimize a pipeline that can more accurately identify these events and determine the functional effects of one of these identified events. Such studies are essential to accurately determine how often these events occur and whether they play a broader role in pediatric cancers, as well, if these events can influence clinical care and potential cancer prevention.",Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer,10314873,F31CA265163,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A role for glycemic variation in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications It is well demonstrated that high glucose levels lead to more rapid development of macrovascular and microvascular complications in people with diabetes. However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10219353,R21HL150374,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' secondary analysis ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,127224
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,10226063,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' genes structure ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2021,449649
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics.

"Personalized Structural Biology: Enabling Exome Interpretation in Undiagnosed Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Our long-term goal is to establish personalized structural biology – a precision medicine approach for inter- preting clinical sequencing data by jointly modeling all mutations in a patient’s proteome in the context of protein 3D structures, known human genetic variation, and other relevant data. In this project, we will develop the com- putational tools needed to integrate the wealth of available genetic variation data with cutting edge algorithms for efficiently modeling mutations to human protein structures and accurately quantifying their specific functional effects. This will provide a rich characterization of healthy and diseased proteomes and the means to generate actionable hypotheses about the effects of variants of unknown significance in individual patients. To demon- strate the power and relevance of this approach, we will apply it to facilitate variant interpretation in individuals in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). We will then collaborate to validate our predictions.  Our central hypothesis is that achieving the full promise of precision medicine requires the interpretation of a patient’s genetic variants in their 3D structural contexts and the integration of structural and clinical infor- mation. Patient genome interpretation is a major roadblock to fully realizing the transformative potential of per- sonalized medicine in the clinic. Current approaches for characterizing protein-coding variants of unknown sig- nificance have several shortcomings that limit their practical utility. First, they are not personalized; most are trained en masse on databases of known mutations across thousands of individuals. Thus, they are subject to ascertainment bias and ignore the background of other variants present in the individual. Second, most fail to provide specific biologically interpretable and thus therapeutically actionable predictions of a mutation’s effects beyond “benign” or “pathogenic”. Third, they are not stable and similar methods often disagree. Fourth, most are unable to interpret multi-base insertions and deletions. As a result and most importantly, current methods often give insufficient guidance to clinicians and fail to personalize next steps of treatment.  Computational methods for modeling the effects of mutations on protein structures are now sufficiently fast and accurate to provide a solution to these challenges. Building on our expertise in analyzing the effects of mutations and modeling protein structures, the following aims establish a computational framework for interpre- tation of exonic variants that is personalized, clinically relevant, accurate, and applicable to all mutation types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying the genetic variants responsible for patient phenotypes is challenging, especially for rare diseases. We will develop algorithms for interpreting variants of unknown clinical significance by modeling the effects of all variants in a patient on protein 3D structures, integrating structural features with machine learning, and using systems biology to identify functional interactions between variants.

"Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Over one in one hundred infants born are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which can cause a host of debilitating symptoms including early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Application of whole exome/genome sequencing to examine NDD has revealed many disease-causing variations, but in a substantial proportion of cases the genetic cause remains undetermined. The analysis of deep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease. For example, intronic variants in the “20N” poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function, causing Dravet Syndrome, an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense- mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) in SCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development, inversely proportional to total RNA expression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it is plausible, if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal development, and intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to disease phenotype. In Aim 1, the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed to detect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developing brain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold to detect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the developing brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exons will be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learning methodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3, intronic variants will be analyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variants have on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights into alternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDD disease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, which allows developing scientists to hone skills in a dynamic, hands-on environment with supplemental training courses as necessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal, training will include courses in conduct of responsible research, advanced biostatistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and wet lab techniques next to personal development to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) are debilitating early-onset diseases estimated to affect 1-2% of the population, and the cause of a substantial proportion of these cases remains unknown. Our lab has recently implicated causative variants in poison exons, a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. The proposed research aims to examine the role of poison exon inclusion in the regulation of genes associated with NDD during neurological development, providing insights into alternative splicing in the brain and provide essential information for diagnosis and potential therapeutics for patients with NDD.",Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and

"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,10238075,U01DK062431,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', '

"Deep tensor genomic imputation Project Summary/Abstract High-throughput sequencing assays allow scientists to measure biochemical properties like transcription factor binding, histone modiﬁcations, and gene expression in nearly any cell line or primary tissue (“biosample”). Unfortunately, measuring all possible biochemical properties in every biosample is infeasible, both because of limited sample availability and because the cost would be prohibitive. We have previously developed a state-of- the-art imputation method, called Avocado, that can ﬁll in the holes in such data sets. Avocado couples tensor factorization with a deep neural network. The method is scalable to large data sets and provides more accurate imputations than competing methods such as ChromImpute or PREDICTD. We have already applied Avocado systematically to the NIH ENCODE data set and made the imputations publicly available via the ENCODE web por tal.  Here, we propose to extend Avocado in four important ways. First, we will extend Avocado to handle single-cell data sets, thereby effectively turning each single-cell experiment into an in silico co-assay that measures multiple properties of each cell in parallel. Second, we will extend Avocado to work with data such as Hi-C, which measures three-dimensional properties of DNA. The extension involves converting Avocado's 3D tensor (biosample assay  genomic position) to a 4D tensor with two genomic position axes. This extension will apply to a wide variety of data types, including various types of Hi-C data, SPRITE, GAM, ChIA-PET and PLAC-seq. Third, we will enhance Avocado to use variant aware genomic sequence to enable high-resolution imputation of regulatory proﬁles. Finally, we will leverage the imputed data to infer cis-regulatory sequence annotations and the molecular impact of regulatory non-coding variants in one of the most comprehensive collections of cellular contexts.  All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and latent factorizations will be made publicly available via the web portals associated with the NIH 4D Nucleome and ENCODE Consortia, providing a valuable public resource for users of these data sets. Project narrative High-throughput sequencing can be used to measure many types of biochemical activity along the genome in a huge variety of primary cell types and cell lines (“biosamples”), but it is prohibitively expensive to measure all possible types of activity in all possible biosamples. Accordingly, we have developed a powerful machine learning approach to predict such measurements before they are performed. Here, we propose to increase Avocado's utility by extending the method to work with single-cell data types, to work with 3D genome architecture data, to incorporate information about DNA sequence and to decode regulatory DNA sequence and non-coding genetic variation.",Deep tensor genomic imputation,10096947,R01HG011466,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Couples ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Avocado ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' next generation ', ' open source ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biological systems ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,398567
"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,10216263,F31ES030282,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Carbon ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrid Cells ', ' Somatic Cell Hybrids ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Lactase ', ' Lactase Enzyme ', ' Lactose Galactohydrolase ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' infection resistance ', ' Resistance to infection ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Meiotic Recombination ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Resolution ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Heritability ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' precise genome editing ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30036
"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,10149376,R01HG010478,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Larva ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transposase ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' muscle system ', ' muscular system ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Population ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,510309
"Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology. Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles. Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development. Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and improve our understanding of disease etiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year and so it remains a high priority to develop effective prevention approaches and to identify new disease specific therapies to reduce disease mortality. The research proposed here has two components: (1) To characterize the genetic component in ovarian cancer development through epigenomic landscape; (2) to establish the functional relevance of genetic findings for clinical translation. This is a highly integrated multi-disciplinary research proposal, and these approaches to novel discovery and mechanistic understanding are desperately needed to advance our basic knowledge of this disease to develop clinical interventions that reduce mortality.",Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic

"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,10115126,R01MH116281,"['Adenine ', ' 1H-Purin-6-amine ', ' Vitamin B4 ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' cost effective ', ' open source ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' Hi-C ', ' Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons ', ' iPSC derived-neurons ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,605699
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput

"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease. The results will also improve the ability to engineer metabolic pathways to produce a protein, chemical, drug or other compound.",Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries,10172925,R01GM125809,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Library ', ' genetic library ', ' Genes ', ' Synthetic Genes ', ' Artificial Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', "" 5'UTR "", ' mRNA Leader Sequences ', "" 5' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Sum ', ' Gene Expression Process ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' metabolic engineering ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' Genome engineering ', ' synthetic biology ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' novel sequencing technology ', ' emerging sequencing technology ', ' new sequencing technology ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,350902
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss
