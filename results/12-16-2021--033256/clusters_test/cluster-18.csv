"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Government ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sales ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Research Activity ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' literature citation ', ' Performance ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Program Description ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' product development ', ' dashboard ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' deep learning ', ' synthetic opioid ', ' synthetic opiate ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275
"Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference MIPS XIX brings together an international community of experts from different fields including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, all investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new trainees and young researchers in a dedicated multidisciplinary forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XIX is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Karla Evans, PhD (University of York Psychology) and Mark McEntee, PhD (University College Cork Clinical Therapies); and committee (University of York) trainee member Emma Raat. It will run July 19-21, 2021 at the Novatel York Centre located near the University of York campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XIX, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus themes are 1) Improving Diagnostic & Screening Performance (or outcomes) in Radiology Using Human & Machine Expertise and 2) Technological & Human Interventions for Enhancing Medical Image Perception. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XIX. To date, 122 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together diverse researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 122 trainees have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference,10235401,R13EB031602,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malpractice ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Scholarship ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' radiologist ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' car accident ', ' automobile accident ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' imaging system ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,10000
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10223438,R01LM013400,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Letters ', ' journal article ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Computer Based Patient Record ', ' Electronic patient record ', ' Electronic-based patient record ', ' Computerized Patient Records ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Proteomics ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Text ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' dynamical evolution ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' pharmacovigilance ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,453141
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to advance the science and practice of implementing evidence-based practices for individuals with cancer. The creation of the Penn ISC3 will leverage the deep expertise and resources at the University of Pennsylvania in implementation science, behavioral economics, and cancer care delivery research to address strategic priorities emphasized in the National Cancer Institute Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel. Specifically, our focus and grand challenge theme is to test implementation strategies informed by behavioral economics to improve uptake of evidence-based practices within our Implementation Laboratory, Penn Medicine, including those from traditionally underserved populations, to improve the lives of individuals with cancer.

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10224953,R00LM013001,"['Award ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' North America ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resort ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' impression ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Nomenclature ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' lexical ', ' Systems Development ', ' Data Science ', ' Formulation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2021,236549
"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nutrition ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trial of Labor ', ' United States ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Voice ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Recurrent Cancer ', ' Recurrent Malignant Tumor ', ' Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Coupled ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' healthy weight ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' attentional control ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' lifestyle data ', ' life-style data ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' telephone coaching ', ' coaching calls ', ' telephone counseling ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312
"Transfer Learning for Digital Curation of the EMR Clinical Narrative Project Summary This proposal is in response to PAR 18-796 to seek support for advancing methodologies for a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative. In the current era of increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedicine, our proposal tackles a critical AI component – automated annotation of health-related text. Since 2015 the development and application of machine learning (ML) methods has exploded propelled by the convergence of plentiful digitized unstructured data (text, speech, images), hardware and the refinement of neural networks or deep learning. 2018 marked a turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transfer learning through pre-trained models like Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification, Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT. In November 2018, Google published the Bidirectional Encodings Representations from Transformers (BERT), a transformer-based model pre-trained on massive general text databases (3.3B words total). The publication reported using BERT representations to build classifiers for 11 NLP tasks which outperformed the state-of-the- art (SOTA) with large margins. The NLP research community jumped to the idea of exploring this new framework but quickly came to the realization that building BERT-style models from scratch is affordable and feasible to only a few. Thus, research investigation proceeded in the direction of using these gigantic models as resources for language representations. Scientific efforts focused on pre-trained models (e.g. BERT) as a source of extracting high quality language features or fine-tuning on a specific task, i.e. using a model as a checkpoint and re-training with much smaller amounts of task-specific data to produce predictions by typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of the representations and training for a few epochs. This general watershed shift in NLP to transfer learning which parallels the developments in computer vision a few years ago coupled with our latest work brings to the forefront a critical NLP research topic ripe for exploration – a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the EMR clinical narrative. The proposed work is research of novel scientific methods for extracting detailed information from health-related text especially the EMR, the major source of phenotype data for patients. Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on responsiveness. This research is in line with the latest developments in neural deep learning approaches and AI in general and is expected to enhance biomedical research and through that the health of the public. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose research on transfer learning methods for the digital curation of a key biomedical asset – the clinical narrative as part of the Electronic Medical Record.

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP Project Summary Our program vision is to unravel the information buried in health-related narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of health texts and distributing them through an advanced NLP software platform under solid governance and sustainability. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. The underlying theme of this renewal is the development of methods towards generalizable, efficient and knowledge-rich models in the context of modern machine learning techniques, particularly models implementing attention mechanisms and using large unlabeled datasets. There is growing penetration of deep learning approaches in the field of health natural language processing. Our proposal aims to address critical methodological gaps and understudied areas in the current unprecedented fast-paced environment. Therefore, our renewal lays out novel and much needed explorations of health NLP research which we will advance through our specific aims. Our datasets will continue to span the spectrum of health-related data – Electronic Medical Records clinical narrative, patient-authored on- line community posts, and health-related social media. The evaluation of the methods we will develop will be performed on the key clinical tasks of concept extraction, relation extraction, and phenotyping with comparisons to other traditional or deep learning algorithms as baselines. We will demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. Project Narrative There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Radical Cystectomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Oncologist ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' alternative treatment ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' support tools ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical development ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preservation ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,867408

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them.

"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,10246259,R01DC017970,"['Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' auditory pathway ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Ear ', ' Floor ', ' Frustration ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' assistive hearing device ', ' assistive listening device ', ' hearing amplification ', ' hearing assistance ', ' hearing assistive device ', ' hearing device ', ' Hearing Tests ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiometry ', ' auditory tests ', ' hearing assessment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Pitch Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Social isolation ', ' sound ', ' Sound Localization ', ' Auditory Localization ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Measures ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Surface ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Measurement ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Auditory system ', ' sound frequency ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Brain region ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' remediation ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Implant ', ' speech processing ', ' network architecture ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' computational basis ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,337875

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,10251982,P30AG064105,"['Arts ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Businesses ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Family-Centered Nursing ', ' Family Nursing ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' person centered ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective intervention ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' dementia care ', ' efficacy study ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' implementation efforts ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,753651
"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting). This study would be the first to provide a bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe. This approach directly supports core scientific values of inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and reproducibility that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global. Project Narrative This study would be the first to develop an initial bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe—not least because poorly developed data models have the potential to impact adversely the health of individuals, groups, and communities. Currently, there is limited conversation around potential bioethics issues in data modeling, and as yet no implementable guidance on how biomedical data science modeling research activities should occur. The initial ethics framework developed by this study would provide a roadmap to ensure that data modeling decision points are documented and their ethical ramifications considered at the outset of model creation, thus supporting core scientific values of inclusivity, accountability, reproducibility, and transparency that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global.",Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points,10250400,R21HG011277,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bioethical Issues ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Accountability ', ' Walking ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Ethical Review ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' data quality ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' high standard ', ' patient population ', ' public trust ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Data Scientist ', ' data tools ', ' biomedical data science ', ' ']",NHGRI,"HASTINGS CENTER, INC.",R21,2021,202625
"Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery The growing volume and breadth of information from the scientific literature and biomedical databases pose challenges to the research community to exploit the content for discovery. This MIRA grant application will advance our knowledge mining and semantic computing system to accelerate data-driven discovery for understanding of gene-disease-drug relationships. We have employed natural language processing and machine learning approaches in a generalizable framework for bioentity and relation extraction from large-scale text. Our Protein Ontology supports protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data for both human understanding and computational reasoning. We have also developed a resource to support functional interpretation and analysis of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) across modification types and organisms. Building on our computational algorithms, bioinformatics infrastructure and community interactions, we will further develop literature mining tools to support automated information extraction across the bibliome and open linked data models for semantic integration of biomedical data from heterogeneous resources. Our text mining tools will be trained for different use cases using deep learning methods. We will develop RDF (Resource Description Framework) semantic models in an increasingly computable, inferable and explainable knowledge system to assist in hypothesis generation. We will present evidence in the form of textual artifacts and semantic models to ensure unbiased analysis and interpretation of results to promote rigorous and reproducible research. We will develop scientific case studies to drive the system development. Examples include PTM disease variant and enrichment analyses for drug target identification, genotype- phenotype knowledge mining for Alzheimer's Disease understanding, and gene-disease-drug knowledge network construction for COVID-19 drug repurposing. To foster community engagement, we will host workshops and hackathons to address critical fundamental research questions and emerging disease scenarios. We have fully adopted the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for resource sharing. All data, tools and research results will be broadly disseminated from the project website, accessible programmatically via RESTful API, queryable via SPARQL endpoints, and dockerized for community code reuse. The successful completion of this research will thus support scalable, integrative and collaborative knowledge discovery to accelerate disease understanding and drug target discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The accelerated growth of research data of increasing volume and complexity is profoundly transforming biomedical research, allowing scientists to ask new research questions and address emerging disease scenarios. We will further develop our literature mining system with an automated workflow for extraction of scientific knowledge across the bibliome, along with semantic integration of biomedical data for computational reasoning in an inferable and explainable knowledge system.

"Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication,10214567,R01CA225773,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computers ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Football game ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Laws ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nicotine ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Opinion ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Privacy ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Policies ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' computer science ', ' phrases ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' narghile ', ' shisha ', ' water pipe ', ' waterpipe ', ' hookah ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Security ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' H1N1 ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' time use ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' influenza outbreak ', ' flu outbreak ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' racial minority ', ' nicotine use ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' Twitter ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' tobacco products ', ' data streams ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE,R01,2021,112506

Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,10214625,R13FD006690,[''],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2021,3125
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Combination Drug Therapy ', ' Polychemotherapy ', ' combination chemotherapy ', ' combination pharmacotherapy ', ' combined drug therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Heart ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Trees ', ' Generations ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Intramural Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' clinical care ', ' natural language ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' social media ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' side effect ', ' off-label use ', ' off-label application ', ' off-label prescribing ', ' biomedical data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,10005323,R01EB024058,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Robotics ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Shoulder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Powered wheelchair ', ' Electric wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Fostering ', ' Robot ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Spinal cord injured survivor ', ' SCI survivor ', ' spinal cord injury survivor ', ' Population ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' n-dimensional ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' arm ', ' body-machine interface ', ' motor recovery ', ' Formulation ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' assistive robot ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2021,375190
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10387466,UG1DA040309,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Artificial

"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications to enable more granular and pervasive measurement, prediction, and provide behavioral interventions offers immense promise in reaching the goal of precision health to maintain the overall health of populations. When applied to devices encountered in our everyday environment, (e.g. personal computers, mobile phones, computer mice, even office furniture such as sit-stand desks), machine learning algorithms can amplify the impact of technology on health improvement by its ability to passively sense stress, and to provide just-in-time behavioral interventions based on contextual data and self-reported user feedback. At the same time, the ethical dimensions of these innovative lines of work – some of which entail fundamental concerns about privacy and autonomy – require careful attention from the scientific community. Most critically, there has been little engagement with the end-users of such technologies as a major stakeholder group who are most affected by these learning systems and tools. This administrative supplement request is premised on the fact that the rationale for and unmet needs targeted in the scope and aims of the parent grant can be even more effectively met (i.e. not changed but enriched) by adding participants with direct exposure and personal experience of interacting with precision health technologies to the last stakeholder group in the parent grant (i.e. patients). By extending the patient group in Aim 1 to include those directly participating in cutting-edge research at the intersection of occupational and precision health research, the Aims and Scope of the parent grant remain unchanged, while the real-world application and impact of the products from the parent grant are substantially enhanced. Our Supplemental proposal incorporates precision health technologies involving behavioral interventions of stress management that use ML into the first Specific Aims of the parent R01. In Supplemental Aim 1, we will use semi-structured interviews and qualitative methods to articulate ethical issues in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in behavioral interventions as part of a precision health methodology, with particular attention to occupational health contexts. Specifically, our methodology elicits a wide range of viewpoints from participants by comparing two distinct types of machine learning applications (i.e. physical versus digital interventions), with two varying degrees of autonomy that users may exercise to accept or reject the AI-recommended interventions. Both of these applications present novel ethical questions regarding the decision-making role of ML/AI algorithms in behavioral health research and practice. This supplementary project leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated as a result of machine learning applications in precision, behavioral, and occupational health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based and AI-driven precision behavioral health now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. The failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of end-users as a major stakeholder group will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. An empirical approach to anticipating ethical concerns is needed to provide practitioners, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in precision behavioral health.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10367404,R01TR003505,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Furniture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Morals ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Occupational ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' real world application ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data privacy ', ' digital intervention ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,157426
"Obesity Health Disparities Research PRIDE Program (OHD PRIDE) ABSTRACT  There is an urgent need to leverage existing scholarly data to develop data-informed interventions to reduce health disparities. Stakeholders associated with the production and use of data have developed a set of principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperative, and reusable (FAIR). The FAIR guiding principles can facilitate biomedical advancements by bolstering data labeling and management practices to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations. The application of FAIR addresses challenges associated with data annotation and management and can support greater efficiency and effectiveness of data used in this area. Adding training to the FAIR principles to early-career faculty members from groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences will bolster a diverse scientific workforce capable of understanding and redressing cardiovascular health disparities, such as disparities in obesity and related areas crucial to minority health in the FAIR principles. The three aims of the proposed project are to (1) apply an Educational Design Research approach to the development, refinement, and finalization of online training modules for biomedical scientists to enhance their knowledge and skills in the competencies needed to make research data FAIR and AI/ML-ready; (2) assemble a multi-disciplinary advisory committee consisting of ethicists, legal scholars, policy analysts, biomedical investigators, data scientists, and learning designers to provide feedback; and (3) conduct formative and summative assessments. The training modules developed and tested in the proposed project can inform the development of data-informed interventions to prevent obesity, mitigate its current high rates, and slow their projected rise as crucial steps in reducing cardiovascular disease.

"A web-based framework for multi-modal visualization and annotation of neuroanatomical data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern experimental approaches allow researchers to collect a variety of whole-brain data from the same animal via different anatomical labels, including tracers, genetic markers, and fiducial marks from recording electrodes. Unfortunately, viewing and analysis methods have not kept pace with the complexity of these datasets, which can be as large as several terabytes. This limitation makes it time- and resource-intensive to view and manipulate light-microscopy data or to share these datasets with distant laboratories. Currently available software solves some aspects of this problem, but no existing program provides a user-friendly way to visualize, annotate, and compare large neuroanatomical datasets across research sites, with minimal investment of computational resources. We propose to develop a web-based tool, named BrainSharer, to allow researchers to access, visualize, align, share, and semi-automatically annotate brain-wide data within a common framework. The foundation for this tool will be provided by Neuroglancer, a generic web-based volumetric viewer first developed at Google and then adapted for use in electron microscopy laboratories. While some of its current features are useful across applications, existing versions of Neuroglancer are not optimized for light-microscopy data. In particular, they do not realize the potential for sharing, viewing, and editing data across multi-laboratory collaborations, such as U19 projects. To enable BrainSharer to serve data rapidly and to save and restore sessions, we will add a modular distributed database to synchronize metadata across laboratories. In addition, we will tailor BrainSharer for light microscopy by displaying data in formats independent of the imaging modality, adding semiautomatic means to segment cell bodies and processes, adding tools for annotation (with special attention to defining cytological boundaries in three dimensions and tracing projection pathways), and adding ways to incorporate auxiliary data such as electrode tracks. In addition, we will integrate alignment tools into BrainSharer, so that separate datasets can be co-registered, visualized, and annotated in the same framework, along with established and emerging atlases. As test beds for development of BrainSharer, we will use three types of datasets from our U19 projects: whole-brain disynaptic and polysynaptic tracing, activity-based staining with c-fos, and neurovascular data. All software, training datasets, and video tutorials for BrainSharer will be made freely available to the community, hosted on our website, along with a slice histology dataset and an electrophysiology dataset with probes implanted throughout the brain. To orient new users, we will also provide a Jupyter notebook for converting raw, intermediate, and registered light-sheet data, along with detected cells and brain atlases, to precomputed format, so they can be loaded into BrainSharer. When complete, BrainSharer will make it straightforward for researchers to use their laptops to combine and compare large datasets from different anatomical labels for viewing and analysis relative to reference atlases, and to share this information across performance sites, thus increasing the ease of use and interoperability of big data in neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE A critical step in understanding brain function is to determine how specific neurons and regions interact via their connections, many of which project between regions. However, three-dimensional neuroanatomical data currently requires massive computational resources to view, analyze, or share with other researchers.

"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently

"Spectroscopy Assisted Laser Microdissection Abstract Molecular understanding of tumors relies greatly on appropriate samples to be prepared from epithelial cells in tissues. Epithelial cells, however, are often surrounded by other cell types and extracting pure populations of these cells is crucial for correct biospecimen preparation and resulting accuracy of molecular assays. Laser microdissection (LM) has contributed immensely in this effort due to its high spatial specificity in the extraction of defined cell populations and ease of use. While LM has enhanced the precision of biochemical analysis, several drawbacks remain. The necessity of staining and human supervision limits throughput, molecular yield and purity of samples. There is little explicit control or confidence in the purity of extracted cell populations while it is difficult to extract multiple cells from the same sample. Combining the morphologic specificity of microscopy and molecular sensitivity of spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging been employed to automate histopathologic recognition in complex tissues using artificial intelligence algorithms applied of spectral data. This project will demonstrate a completely automated instrument by coupling LM with IR microscopy. Termed spectroscopy-assisted laser microdissection (SLaM), the developed prototype will be validated using state of the art IR imaging systems and commercial LCM in terms of accuracy, speed and type fidelity. Last, the approach will be applied to extract cells of different types from the same prostate sample to demonstrate the capability to multiplex LM (muxLM) from the same tissue. The project directly addresses the need to reduce the time- and labor-intensive nature of LM. SLaM can maximize the quality and utility of biological samples used for downstream analyses by automation, high throughput and precision while enabling a comprehensive acquisition of cells without user fatigue or error, thereby providing a sample of higher integrity and quality for cancer molecular analysis. Project Narrative This project seeks to systematically develop and validate a new instrument for laser microdissection (LM). This infrared spectroscopic imaging powered prototype will recognize cells without staining, automates the laser capture of these cells and allows them to be extracted for biochemical assays at faster speed and higher accuracy than available with current technology. Since LM is critical to sample preparation in complex tissue, this project will make tissue-based analyses high throughput, automated and easier to use in biomedical research and in clinical protocols.",Spectroscopy Assisted Laser Microdissection,10284780,R21CA263147,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Polymers ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' Tissue Stains ', ' Spottings ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Slide ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' infrared microscopy ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Performance ', ' Microdissection ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' mixed cell culture ', ' laser capture microdissection ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Structural Chemistry ', ' Collecting Cell ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' imaging system ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' preservation ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,188193
"CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics, Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning Translational research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been hindered by the lack of shared data resources with sufficient depth, breadth and diversity. There are very limited EHR datasets freely available to the general research community especially the AI research community through credential-based access. MIMIC dataset is from a single institution that has a fixed and limited racial, ethnic and geographic profile. The eICU dataset is limited in data comprehensiveness (e.g., number of kinds of lab tests ~1/5 of MIMIC), data span (1 year, 2014- 2015), and data variety (e.g., no free text clinical notes) etc. Thus MIMIC and eICU respectively have advantages and disadvantages of data depth and data breadth. The vision of this proposal is to leverage multiple CTSAs with diverse racial, ethnic and geographic profiles in order to develop and evaluate a multi-site de-identified ICU dataset, to facilitate accelerate translational research in AI and deep learning approaches to understand, track, and predict the pathophysiological state of patients. In this project, a group of nationwide CTSA sites will work together to build a new, more inclusive, multi-site dataset that is downloadable from NCATS cloud by researchers with credential-based access. This project will combine the respective advantages of MIMIC (data depth) and eICU (data breadth). The created dataset will include more geographic regions, larger quantities of time-series data, including pre-, during- and post- ICU patient information. This will incorporate not only more patient diversity, but also capture regional population differences and practice variations that could have clinical impact. Aim 1 will develop and provide credentialed access to a multi-site dataset consisting of de-identified discrete outpatient, inpatient, and ICU data for critically ill at respective CTSAs. Aim 2 will create federated access dataset from and develop novel federated learning methods on the part of the multi-site ICU data consisting of unstructured clinical notes or structured data for select group of patients at higher risks of re-identification (e.g., rare disease patients). Aim 3 will develop novel memory-network based meta-learning AI algorithms and use the multi-site dataset to answer concrete and long-standing clinical problems in critical care. Aim 4 will innovatively leverage the library network to develop and disseminate open resources for the research community and develop best practice guidelines for other CTSAs to join the effort. In particular, we aim to support and cultivate the growth of next generation medical AI workforce for research and practice. We aim to establish a large cross-CTSA collaborative data sharing for critical care by leveraging the existing CTSA collaborative networks. With the diversified racial, ethnic and geographic profiles from the above CTSAs, we will be able to support fair and generalizable algorithms for advanced patient monitoring and decision support. The proposed project will provide best practice guidance to and set up exemplary examples for nationwide CTSAs. It will also support the cultivation of next generation medical AI researchers.

"Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide Summary People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have autoimmune destruction of beta cells resulting in insufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, thereby requiring exogenous insulin treatment, typically delivered subcutaneously either continuously infused through an insulin pump or by injection multiple times throughout the day. There are now commercial closed loop systems available that enable automated delivery of fast- acting insulin in response to wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors that inform an automated control algorithm to calculate and deliver insulin via a pump. Unfortunately, current commercial closed loop systems are hybrid systems that require users to announce meals to the system, and these hybrid systems do not control glucose well following meals. People oftentimes forget to announce their meals or misestimate their carbohydrate intake, thereby leading to poor overall postprandial glucose control. The primary benefit of hybrid closed loop systems has been during the overnight period when meals are not consumed. In a normal working beta cell, the hormone amylin is co-secreted with insulin in response to meals to help suppress glucagon production and delay gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose increases. Pramlintide is an analog of the endogenous hormone amylin. Our commercial partner, Adocia, has developed a coformulation of insulin and pramlintide. In this project, we will develop a dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system with a meal detection algorithm that will enable substantial improvements in postprandial glycemic control for people with T1D while minimizing patient burden by not requiring a meal announcement to the system. Our group has previously developed a multi hormone closed loop system (insulin and glucagon) and we have developed models of insulin, pramlintide, glucagon, and carbohydrate kinetics and dynamics that will be integrated into a new insulin+pramlintide closed loop model predictive control (MPC) system (Aim 1). We have also developed a meal detection algorithm that will be integrated with this MPC control algorithm to dose insulin and pramlintide shortly after a meal is detected, thereby eliminating the need for the user to announce this meal to the system (Aim 1). We will use our in silico simulator of glucose metabolism to identify the optimal dosing amount and timing when insulin and pramlintide are delivered in response to the meal detection algorithm (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapies identified in Aim 1 and evaluate the top 4 strategies during an in-clinic meal test in a 4-arm randomized crossover study in 14 people with T1D (Study 1a, Aim 2). We will then evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy identified in Study 1a and compare with various insulin-only hybrid and automated therapies in an in-clinic randomized crossover study (Study 1b, Aim2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy determined in Aim 2 and compare it with the Tandem Diabetes Control-IQ commercial hybrid closed loop system. Narrative People with type 1 diabetes have difficulty managing their glucose levels, especially during the daytime in response to carbohydrate intake; persistently elevated glucose levels can lead to dangerous, poor overall health outcomes including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. We will develop a new dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system that can automatically detect meals and dose in response to these meals. By combining the slowed gastric emptying and suppression of endogenous glucose production that pramlintide provides with a meal detection algorithm, we expect to translate a fully automated closed loop system with minimal patient burden that can achieve substantial improvements in glycemic control both during the evening and during the day.",Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide,10276661,R01DK129382,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Gastric Emptying ', ' stomach emptying ', ' Glucagon ', ' Antidiabetic Hormone ', ' Glukagon ', ' HG-Factor ', ' Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Nausea ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' islet amyloid polypeptide ', ' Insulinoma amyloid peptide ', ' amlintide ', ' amylin ', ' diabetes associated peptide ', ' insulinoma amyloid polypeptide ', ' pancreatic amylin ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Insulin, Aspart, Human ', ' B28Asp ', ' insulin B28Asp ', ' insulin aspart ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Gastroparesis ', ' Gastric Stasis ', ' delayed gastric emptying ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' analog ', ' carbohydrate metabolism ', ' Metabolic ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Pramlintide ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose production ', ' glucose RA ', ' glucose rate of appearance ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' diabetes control ', ' arm ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' recruit ', ' Injections ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' in silico ', ' virtual patient ', ' autoimmune pathogenesis ', ' autoimmune attack ', ' autoimmune destruction ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,560513
"Using gamification, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and Alexa Voice to optimize user experience for individuals living with AD/ADRD and their caregivers More than 5.8 million Americans live with dementia and one in 10 Americans over the age of 65 suffer from a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (AD/ADRD). There are no cures for AD and drug treatments have little overall impact on the course and symptoms of disease. There are no diagnostic tools that can reliably identify people in the early stages of the disease. Individuals living with AD/ADRD have the same quality of life needs as individuals without dementia, including the ability to successful complete routine activities of daily living and maintain satisfying levels of independence and autonomy. However, in the setting of progressively diminishing memory and worsening abilities for self-care, individuals living with AD/ADRD experience progressive losses in independent decision- making capacity and quality of life. Social isolation and anxiety are disabling consequences of this condition. The MapHabitTM system (MHS), is an award-winning (NIH/NIA 1st place Eureka Award) patented, neuroscience-based assistive technology app that helps the memory-impaired accomplish activities of daily living, maintain their independence, and improves overall quality of life for users. The MHS product leverages the science of visual mapping to cue appropriate behavior in the AD setting. In this SBIR Phase II application, MapHabit will further develop the utility and effectiveness of the MHS visual mapping technology to enhance its commercialization and marketing potential by increasing its “stickiness” (i.e., motivation to engage with the app) and to establish a more substantive evidence base for its effects on improved quality of life and daily functioning. We propose two specific aims: Aim 1 – MapHabit will optimize the user experience for individuals with AD/ADRD by supplementing its visual mapping software with gamification technology via a partnership with a virtual reality and in-app games company that serves healthcare needs. Social networking (via gaming with friends and other residents) will be developed to build social connectivity and increase competition, both of which are known to increase “stickiness” and keep users engaged and motivated to adhere to behavioral interventions such as ADLs. We will conduct a 6-month clinical trial to assess behavioral outcomes. Aim 2 – MapHabit will develop a predictive analytics framework using the biometric and behavioral data streams from individuals as they use visual maps to carry out their ADLs. Partnering with a healthcare artificial intelligence company, we will conduct an observational cohort study to collect and integrate 16 months of data streams from 15 dyads from multiple data sources, including gamification and social networking using the MHS, standardized neuropsychological assessments of the patients, and assessments from caregivers. These novel data will be used to explore new predictive models that will potentially indicate early warnings of oncoming cognitive decline. MapHabit’s proposal is focused on the development of science-based, innovative assistive technology for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). The technology objective is to help individuals maintain their independence and autonomy longer and reduce the burden of AD/ADRD caregiving by using visual mapping that cues behavior. These goals reflect the nation’s public health goals of reducing the burden of AD/ADRD on individuals, their families, and society at large.","Using gamification, predictive analytics, artificial

"Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning toImprove Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency Caring for patients in the operating room (OR) requires a complex set of resources, personnel, and logistics. Improving the accuracy, speed, and granularity of information exchange in this environment significantly impacts outcomes, safety, satisfaction, & access to care. Additionally, increasing efficiency can have a significant positive economic impact, an important implication for all hospitals. Therefore, automation of manual documentation and task coordination can enhance productivity, safety, and profitability, as well as job satisfaction for clinicians.  The Whiteboard Coordinator (WC) platform solves these market challenges through artificial intelligence (AI) driven OR workflows and resource management. The platform is deployed on a virtual server within a hospital’s local network. It communicates with the existing electronic medical record (EMR) to import the day’s surgery schedule and assigned resources. Once OR workflow begins, an intelligent network of sensors and cameras employing machine vision algorithms record locations and times of patients, equipment, and supplies. As clinical activities begin, the software automatically alerts all stakeholders of important events via text and paging to coordinate clinical processes. Information is also disseminated on digital displays throughout stakeholder locations, such as the OR, preoperative holding, post anesthesia care unit, sterile supply, high-traffic hallways, and break rooms. Given the unpredictable nature of surgical procedures, this automated information feed ensures all providers are effortlessly informed, allowing all stakeholders to synchronize independent, but parallel workflows. The intelligent sensor network of cameras and machine vision algorithms automatically detects and updates availability and location of resources. The software automates existing manual logistics documentation. Finally, WC rapidly disseminates detailed information in a targeted manner (i.e. to specific surgeons, nurses, technicians, janitorial staff, etc.) to eliminate alarm fatigue and enhance productivity.  The project includes four main aims. First, the Phase I prototype platform will be enhanced with new features to fully support user workflow and efficiency across all OR stakeholders. Targeted updates will focus on connected data domains and cross platform integration, user interface workflows and automated reports, and voice command integration. Second, the AI suite will be significantly updated with novel tools that build upon the Phase I framework including detection of novel surgery types & events, detection of surgical supplies & inventory management, and a simulation toolbox for resource planning. Once all platform updates have been technically verified and validated, the supporting infrastructure and production ecosystem will be scaled to support commercial release. This includes formal quality functions, operations, support and staging/production environments. The Whiteboard Coordinator platform and production environment will be validated against quality system requirements, then deployed in a large-scale field study to document OR effectiveness and utility. The objective is to enhance, scale, and commercially deploy Whiteboard Coordinator, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven software platform for hospital operating rooms (OR) that reduces documentation burden, optimizes workflows and resource planning, and allows clinicians to focus on patient care. The objective is to ensure patient, surgeon, anesthesiologist, technicians, nurses, janitorial staff, equipment, instruments, supplies, rooms and beds are available at required times and locations. Given the number of inputs, complexity of processes, and dynamic temporal adjustments, this high stress clinical environment can strongly benefit from automated monitoring and AI driven coordination.",Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning toImprove Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency,10319306,R44LM013026,"['Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Beds ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Equipment and Supplies ', ' Apparatus and Instruments ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Intelligence ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Manuals ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Day Surgery ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' economic impact ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Documentation ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' operation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine vision ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,"ARTISIGHT, INC.",R44,2021,782980
"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing.

Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parainfluenza ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' base ', ' career ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Abdominal Cavity ', ' Cavitas abdominis ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Bedside Technology ', ' Bedside Computings ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Computational Science ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' treatment effect ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Trauma patient ', ' individual patient ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' deep learning ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' advanced analytics ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis Project Summary  The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.  Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale, size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in innovative ways to address new experimental areas.  Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects: deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.  The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.  In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology. Project Narrative Biologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells, tissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family

"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' systematic review ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' evidence base ', ' public health research ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' Adoption ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,766649
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging A Data Science Workshop (DSW) hosted at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) originated as a small gathering of local scientific computing specialists to share techniques and methods. However, as high-throughput data generation and AI/ML have gained prominence, there has been greatly increased demand from non-specialists, including PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose work mostly entails bench biology, for introductory and intermediate training in all aspects of data acquisition, storage, and analysis. They are generally computer-savvy already and able to program to some degree, and their interest is in short, hands-on demonstrations of how to apply AI/ML methods to data either generated or accessible via their research. The interest in data science classes is growing at OUHSC, but this need is still not met. Currently, the DSW is a volunteer effort, and the nascent OUHSC data science curriculum has minimal instruction on how to make data AI/ML ready or how to follow FAIR principles. This supplement will enable us to develop material on these topics and promulgate it via workshops, coursework, and freely accessible online content.

"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). Machine learning-based predictions can be used to help create treatment plans that minimize the chance of severe xerostomia, and to better anticipate and manage its occurrence.

"Fully-Automated Lesion Characterization in Ultrawide-Field Retinal Images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes/eyelids and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to develop a more precise DR scoring scheme. This would help identify patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression.

"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10246800,R03HS027671,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2021,58019
"Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Project Summary/Abstract  This Phase III (P-III) COBRE project will extend the cores that have been successfully leveraged in our Phase I (P-I) and Phase II (P-II) COBRE projects and sustain these unique resources in New Mexico through the im- plementation of a business plan. Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),10372242,P30GM122734,"['Appointment ', ' Awareness ', '

"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10267034,R01TR003505,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Justice ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Employee ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' stakeholder perspectives ', ' stakeholder insights ', ' ']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442905
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this approach because of the PI’s expertise in breath analysis for detection of Tuberculosis and lung cancer and the team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence.",A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19,10266377,U18TR003787,"['Ethanol ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' ETOH ', ' Ethyl

"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"From atoms to mechanisms - Artificial Intelligence augmented molecular simulations for mechanistic ligand design While there have been numerous advances in computational methods aiding in rational drug design, most approaches so far take a static view of the drug target, ignoring the complexities associated with the dynamics and thermodynamics of conformational transitions. There is thus a pressing need for new computational methods that are accurate, tractable and automatable for large scale drug discovery and chemical biology studies that account for the changing nature of a generic drug target. Built on strong theoretical and computational preliminary results, this program seeks to understand and guide design of new inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and model riboswitches in a mechanistically guided paradigm. Our research program is driven by the central hypotheses that (a) mechanistically aware ligand design strategies can outperform traditional strategies guided only by structure, and (b) artificial intelligence (AI)- integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods can help learn mechanisms in a high-throughput fashion. Our program can be split into two overarching yet complementary thematic areas. In the first area, we will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics, MD simulations and AI to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change. Specifically we will build on our preliminary work in using ideas from neural information processing and natural language processing, and adapt them for advanced sampling methods that learn reaction coordinate, thermodynamics and kinetics on-the-fly as the simulation progresses. In addition, we will also be interacting closely with other leading computational groups to integrate our sampling methods with theirs and to facilitate efficient, accurate sampling for polarizable force-field development. In the second area, we will use our algorithms to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1 riboswitches. We will take a mechanistically driven perspective wherein we will map out the different conformations of a given target and understand how an existing ligand interacts with these, and then propose ligand modifications based upon this understanding. We will use our AI-augmented MD methods to understand the dissociation mechanisms of ligands in one uninterrupted “atoms to mechanism” workflow with minimal human intervention. All our predictions will be validated in different ways by our experimental collaborators at Stony Brook University and the National Cancer Institute This MIRA proposal will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence to probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change in drug targets.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data.

"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,10225587,R01EB016701,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Grooming ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Joint ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurology ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Funding ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Deformity ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Human Pathology ', ' in vivo ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Ontology ', ' Scheme ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Geometry ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' preservation ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Patient imaging ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,540280

"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),10228674,R24MH120037,"['Archives ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain surgery ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Evaluation ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' data quality ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Descriptor ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Performance ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Development ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cyber infrastructure ', ' cyberinfrastructure ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' web interface ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' data format ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' built environment ', ' support tools ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' preservation ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' data tools ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2021,905255
"Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management Project Summary  The easy availability of huge amount of user generated health information on social networks, blogs, YouTube, Twitter, and hospital review sites presents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how social media can be a channel to inform and communicate healthcare information to patients and facilitate patient- centric health promotion and literacy improvement. YouTube hosts over 100 million healthcare related videos on a variety of medical conditions. This plethora of user-generated content can be leveraged by patients to improve adherence to clinical guidelines and self-care required for management of chronic diseases. In this project, we propose an augmented intelligence-based approach that effectively combines human input from domain experts and consumers with machine learning and natural language processing methods from computer science to winnow down and retrieve relevant, contextualized video materials that clinicians can recommend to patients. The problem of identifying the most relevant videos from a patient perspective is challenging, but provides an immense innovation space for this approach. We will leverage a co-training machine learning framework and incorporate inputs from patient education assessment tools and clinicians to assess diabetes- related videos on two dimensions: the amount of medical information encoded in the videos and video understandability. We will develop a user-centric patient education video recommender system by integrating these two dimensions with the YouTube video ranking results. Furthermore, we will apply a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines computational evaluations, comparisons with YouTube baseline, and causal analysis methods to understand the performance of the automated methods and the relationship between video understandability and collective user engagement. Finally, we will integrate our computational approach in a modular research prototype technology platform that will accept health related YouTube videos as inputs (generated from patients' keyword searches on diabetes) and produce a ranked list of top 10 retrieved videos for further review by clinicians, and evaluated for barriers and facilitators of the technology usage. Recommending relevant educational materials in video format that leverage user-generated content is one way to deliver personalized and contextualized healthcare information, and resources for self-care management, to patients and consumers. As technology continues to advance and evolve, our methods can be refined further and evaluated via clinical trials to improve patient education, empower patients, caregivers and clinicians, and improve societal health and health literacy. Project Narrative This proposal aims to complement and expand existing approaches for health promotion and health literacy improvement in the population by developing and evaluating automated methods for the easy retrieval of understandable, contextualized patient education videos that clinicians can recommend to their patients from the enormous corpus of user generated content on YouTube. This approach offers the potential for significant impact on patient engagement and empowerment due to its scalability and generalizability. Leveraging advanced machine learning methods for automation combined with social science methods for impact evaluation also allows the incorporation of critical elements for improved patient-physician communication such as transparency, credibility and relevance of the recommended materials.",Leveraging YouTube Video Analytics for Patient Education: A Digital TherapyTool for Clinicians to Retrieve and Recommend Understandable Videos on Chronic Disease Management,10212707,R01LM013443,"['Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' literate ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Retrieval ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' prototype ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' social media ', ' individual patient ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' Twitter ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital treatment ', ' digital therapeutics ', ' digital therapy ', ' Home ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Automation ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Centers ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' ']",NLM,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,347030
"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation.

"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design. Structure prediction algorithms could provide atomic models for these purposes in the near future.

Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),10173820,P30GM122734,"['Appointment ', ' Awareness ', '

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['K-12 Education ', ' K-12 classroom ', ' K-12 level ', ' K12 classroom ', ' K12 education ', ' K12 level ', ' reading ability ', ' reading achievement ', ' reading competence ', ' reading proficiency ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' English Learner ', ' English Language Learner ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Future Teacher ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' student teacher ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' learning community ', ' learning engagement ', ' learning outcome ', ' personalized learning ', ' science teacher ', ' science educator ', ' science professional ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' Home ', ' Adoption ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Books ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Gametogenesis ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sperm cell ', ' Sperm ', ' Spermatozoa ', ' zoosperm ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' resource guides ', ' skills ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reader ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' egg ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education ', ' STEM Education ', ' STEM knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education ', ' science, technology, engineering and math knowledge ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,700935
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fluorescein Angiography ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Publishing ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Detachment ', ' retina detachment ', ' Retinal Neovascularization ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' Funduscopes ', ' improved ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' awake ', ' diabetic ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' macular edema ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Devices ', ' disorder of macula lutea ', ' macula abnormality ', ' macula lutea abnormality ', ' macular disease ', ' macular disorder ', ' maculopathy ', ' disorder of macula of retina ', ' Fundus ', ' portability ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Monitor ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neovascularization ', ' neonate ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' prototype ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' arm ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' improved outcome ', ' Injections ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' treatment risk ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' Visualization ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,10098312,R01DA039159,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Future ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' post intervention ', ' drugged driving ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' motivational intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' brief motivational intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' nonmedical use ', ' non-medical use ', ' public health priorities ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' recruit ', ' overdose risk ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' clinical encounter ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation facilitators ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,552775
"National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Project summary/abstract NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington) has been active since 1999. The existing NACC infrastructure is described in the Facilities and Resources Section of this application. The broad goals of the past funding cycles are consistent with those of the current U24 RFA — that is, to serve as: a.) the central hub for organizing and enabling communication within and outside of the ADRC program, including annual meetings and steering committees; b.) a national data resource, collecting data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) as well as affiliated data and sample repositories; and c.) a facilitator of current and future AD/ADRD research. NACC has considerable experience and success in reaching these goals, and is positioned for continued success in a rapidly advancing field. New data and methods are appearing in areas such as biomarkers, neuropathology, and tests for early detection. Through the strategic adoption of technological advances, we will build on these accomplishments at an accelerated pace. Building on our already significant capabilities, we will: promote and broaden communication within and outside of the ADRC program; expand informatics capabilities of NACC consistent with FAIR principles; conduct and support methodologic and applied research, leveraging deep expertise in biostatistics and data science; and support early-career research scientists by providing peer-reviewed competitive funding for several “junior investigators” each year. We aim to continue to improve our approach in each arena by combining time-tested approaches with the new tools and innovations we are developing to meet the changing scientific, technological, and communication needs of the NIA ADRC program and the field. Narrative NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington — now seeking renewal as a U24) has been active since 1999, and has established a standardized, longitudinal clinical database of over 42,000 individuals (with neuropathology data on over 6,100), as well as cross-sectional, retrospective data on roughly 66,000 individuals seen at ADRCs between 1984 and 2005. NACC has made these data freely available to researchers worldwide, resulting in hundreds of publications. We will modernize and intensify our informatics approach, making data access and use more efficient; will grow communication and coordination capabilities with the ADRCs and collaborating NIA projects; will develop and apply big-data research tools for the field; and will provide competitive, peer-reviewed research support for several new investigators each year. Together with the field’s leaders, NACC will innovate, develop, and drive solutions to meet the changing needs of the field as well as the NIA ADRC program.",National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center,10204491,U24AG072122,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Communication ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Research Peer Review ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' trend ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' translational health science ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' high standard ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' e-science ', ' escience ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' data visualization ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' community center ', ' social media ', ' Data Science ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' data access ', ' data resource ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' clinical database ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U24,2021,7018487
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,10206145,R01HD107493,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Information Management ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Methods ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Paper ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neovascular ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' data integration ', ' prospective ', ' analytical tool ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' real world application ', ' high risk ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' phenotypic data ', ' data access ', ' imaging genetics ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' recruit ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' risk prediction model ', ' multiple data types ', ' feature extraction ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' supplemental oxygen ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Mendelian randomization ', ' ']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,640901

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Deglutition Disorders ', ' Dysphagia ', ' Swallowing Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Explosion ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Barium swallow ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' impression ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' K24 Award ', ' Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24) ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' Instruction ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Secure ', ' data registry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data resource ', ' human error ', ' health assessment ', ' data warehouse ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' learning algorithm ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209
"ABCD Course on Reproducible Data Analyses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ABCD-ReproNim Course (1R25-DA051675) is a collaborative partnership to provide research educational training in reproducible analyses of data from the ABCD Study. The course integrates curriculum from ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, which is a NIBIB-funded P41 Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) whose vision is to help neuroimaging researchers achieve more reproducible data analysis workflows and outcomes. The ReproNim approach relies on both technical development of readily accessible, user-friendly computational tools and services that can be readily integrated into current research practices, as well as a broad educational outreach about reproducibility to the neuroimaging community at large, including developers as well as applied researchers across basic sciences and clinical disciplines. The current project proposes an administrative supplement to provide dedicated research training on making data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study FAIR (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and AI/ML (i.e., Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) ready. ML/AI applications have increased relevance in the discovery of biomarkers, predicting intervention outcomes, and integrating information across datasets. However, the knowledge required to perform effective biomedical ML research spans knowledge about data, scientific questions, computing technologies alongside ML/AI platforms and tools. The ABCD-ReproNim AI/ML Course will extend the current training to make trainees aware of the tools, concepts, and caveats for multimodal ML/AI processing of ABCD data. Students will first receive training across a 5-week online course that includes lectures, readings, and ABCD data exercises on topics that include: (1) FAIR for and FAIRness in ML/AI Applications, (2) Core Concepts in ML, (3), Neuroimaging ML, (4) Interpretable/Explainable ML, and (5) Introduction to Deep Learning. Competencies and skills addressed will include training and publishing ML models, organizing and evaluating data for ML applications, and reusing existing models efficiently. Didactic instruction will be followed by a 5-day remote Project Week, where students will apply the skills learned and work towards completion of AI/ML data analysis projects. Success will result in well-trained researchers who are able to apply reproducible AI/ML practices to test generalizability of AI/ML models for cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction across the ABCD dataset.

"2022 Chemistry & Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Summary/Abstract The 2022 Chemistry and Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference (CBP-GRC) will highlight the exciting diversity of peptide science. Attendees will engage in discussions regarding scientific discoveries, challenges and advances in the design, synthesis, characterization, and translation of peptides. We have created an innovative and cutting-edge program encompassing sessions focusing on recent developments in chemical biology and organic synthesis complemented with sessions covering topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), vaccine development, immunology, natural and unnatural products, advances in green chemistry, biosynthesis, and novel technologies. To engage the audience and promote discussion, session chairs will give an overview of the broader field in each session to bring the audience together before the session speakers deliver their lectures. Furthermore, to increase cross-talk amongst scientists, sessions including “peptide mash-up” and the “future of peptides” will bring together scientists from vastly different fields (e.g. green chemistry, drug discovery, and structural biology) in a single session encouraging and stimulating our attendees to think outside of their own scientific boxes and promote collaboration across multiple disciplines. In 2022, the successful and well attended Power Hour will continue, highlighting the challenges women and minorities are still facing, as well as discussing solutions and progress toward equity. Altogether, this conference provides a collegial environment where emerging scientists present their work alongside world leaders in the field and the conference is the highlight of the peptide community conference calendar. The graduate and postdoctoral student-run Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), held in conjunction with the related GRC, will provide opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to foster meaningful connections by discussing their research and networking with their peers. The student- facilitated seminar, as well as the poster session, are designed to foster communication between students and form relationships which are then leveraged at the GRC. In addition, the GRS includes a career panel in which three mid-to-late career professionals provide insights and strategies on various career paths. The objective of the CBP-GRC is to provide opportunities to deepen the impact of peptide science on healthcare and technology through scientific communication and collaboration while actively prioritizing a diversified community and the involvement of underrepresented minorities. This goal will be achieved by actively inviting speakers and session chairs from diverse backgrounds and career experience as well as developing a scientifically innovative and diverse program.

"Center for Live Cell Genomics ABSTRACT Center for Live Cell Genomics We will build new methodology and capacity for large-scale, long-term, inexpensive, modular, customizable, shared, Internet-of-Things-controlled, reproducible live cell culture and tissue-based experimental genomics disease models. Tissue models include traditional cell culture as well as organoid and primary tissue explants obtained from surgery or biopsy. Organoid factories supporting tissue growth and maintenance will be integrated with external and on-chip electro-optofluidic analytical modules to become part of an ecosystem that is modeled after open-source software. It will use commodity sensors, cameras, and computers linked in platforms flexibly designed using simple 3D printing, molding, etching and milling techniques potentially available at any institution. This will stimulate rapid innovation in experimental platforms for tissue culture. We will push this technology and use its best-in-class capabilities to make progress in neurodevelopment and pediatric cancer, addressing big questions. What genes contribute most importantly and specifically to human brain development? How do they go wrong in neurodevelopmental disease or brain injury? What specific molecular pathways are disrupted in individual pediatric cancer cases? How can we test pathway-specific treatments in a tissue model specific to each patient? Our education and outreach plans include a training program to develop a diverse and inclusive cohort of undergraduate students trained in genomic science through secondary school and community college outreach as well as coding workshops and research-based laboratory classes for UCSC undergraduates to develop core competencies. Participation in these activities serve as a basis for training graduate students and postdocs in inclusive pedagogy and mentorship. We are also developing a one-stop information hub to form an online community and to share our technology through immersive webinars and tutorials aimed at a broader audience with a range of expertise from the general public to scientists and clinicians at research institutions. Our work will enable significant advances in neuroscience and cancer research and education, stimulate a new open-source culture in cell biology and genomics, and democratize scientific and educational access beyond elite institutions, extending sharing projects like NHGRI ANvIL beyond data and code to include experiments and Internet-connected experimental platforms. Project Narrative We will introduce a new experimental platform paradigm to genomic studies of live cells and tissues that will allow scientists to be more creative, more productive, more collaborative and use fewer resources for their live cell genomics experiments.

"The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With nearly 6 million cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosed in the United States in 2019, the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is of critical importance. Promoting the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is an effective way to support these unpaid staples of ADRD care. Although interventions targeting ADRD caregivers continues to accelerate, little attention has been paid to caregivers’ use of supportive services, which remains strikingly low. The objective of this K99/R00 application is to enable Dr. Falzarano to develop the necessary expertise to design, implement, and evaluate studies focused on leveraging technology to support and address ADRD caregivers’ multifarious needs. In the K99 phase, Dr. Falzarano will work toward achieving five training objectives that will prepare her to transition to become an independent investigator who designs and evaluates evidence-based technologies to enhance tailored caregiver support. First, she will extend her knowledge in substantive areas including dementia caregiving and front-end and back-end software development. Second, she will learn how to develop, implement, and test behavioral interventions with an emphasis on collaboration with community partners. Third, she will receive training in statistical methods to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourth, she will learn about measurement development and psychometric validation of assessments for ADRD caregivers. Fifth, Dr. Falzarano will pursue professional development activities, particularly in the areas of grant writing, leadership, and integration of research and web development teams. The four proposed research aims were chosen to complement the areas identified for career development. Aim 1a will provide the requisite training and experiences to provide Dr. Falzarano with the critical skills needed to conduct the proposed study. Aim 1b will include interviews with ADRD caregivers to identify needs, awareness of, barriers to, and willingness to use services. Aim 1c will leverage key stakeholder (dementia-care experts) input to identify existing services corresponding to areas of need identified in Aim 1b. Aim 2 will leverage data collected from caregivers and stakeholders to inform the iterative development and design of the Caregiver Resource Room (CRR) website, which will include a digital self-assessment tool using machine learning models to identify and categorize needs and provide an output of targeted service recommendations. Aim 3 will include an analysis of the tool’s content, design, features, and services output, which will be iteratively refined based on ADRD caregiver feedback. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Aim 4 to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the CRR as a tool to enhance awareness of and access to relevant services to address unmet needs and improve mental health. The proposed research is well-aligned with the NIA’s strategic initiative to foster the development of research scientists in aging and to develop and test promising interventions to improve ADRD caregiver outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The multifarious needs of ADRD caregivers often remain unaddressed, and the utilization rate of supportive services remains strikingly low, with many caregivers uncertain about what services may be right for them, what exists, and how to access them. There is a need for a robust, reliable tool that comprehensively evaluates ADRD caregiver needs with a mechanism to connect needs with existing services, thereby overcoming barriers that ADRD caregivers face in accessing needed supportive care. The proposed project seeks to iteratively develop and test an online self-assessment and tailored referral platform, grounded in machine learning principles and informed by stakeholder perspectives, to address needs and enhance knowledge and use of relevant services, with the overall goal of linking ADRD caregivers with relevant support and thereby promoting their mental health and well-being.",The Caregiver Resource Room: Enhancing Support for Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10284406,K99AG073509,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention

"Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence-based guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management aimed at glycemic control (reduced hemoglobin A1c) include a combination of diet, physical activity (PA), glucose monitoring, and medication adherences. However, the majority of individuals with T2DM are unable to follow these guidelines due to a lack of consistent health behavior counseling offered in the primary care setting. This problem is amplified in remote rural communities within the U.S. In response, this project aims to create an optimized telehealth-based intervention – Gamified Optimized Diabetes management with Artificial Intelligence–powered Rural Telehealth (GODART). GODART is grounded in the social cognitive theory and will serve as an automated behavior-monitoring and telecoaching platform. At the core, GODART is an automated conversational style behavior-monitoring system using natural language–understanding technologies. In this project, we propose to pilot and feasibility test the various components of GODART by leveraging multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an efficient and rigorous resource-management and continuous- improvement framework for developing optimized interventions. Our proposal focuses on the MOST preparatory phase and will use a full factorial experimentation. We will pilot and assess the feasibility of and evaluate two different intervention components, with two levels in each of the groups, yielding four experimental conditions. These groups will test the effect of (i) a fixed vs. adaptive (gamified) rewards program and (ii) automated vs. human-delivered weekly health coaching. We will end the project with exit interviews conducted with a subset of participants. Study findings will help us learn the feasibility of delivering such an intervention and its preliminary effectiveness in reducing HbA1c, leading to adequately powered confirmatory effectiveness studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this study is to pilot and assess feasibility of implementing an artificial intelligence assisted individualized lifestyle modification intervention for glycemic control in rural populations, which can delivered even regular a landline phone service.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' decision tree learning ', ' econometrics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,10163822,R21CA250024,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diet Records ', ' Dietary Records ', ' Food Diaries ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Restaurants ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Speed ', ' Nutrient ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' food quality ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' food consumption ', ' weight maintenance ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' system architecture ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' virtual model ', ' dietary ', ' Home ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2021,197745
"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care. PROJECT NARRATIVE FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. Our mixed methods learning evaluation uses regularly fielded quick surveys of primary care clinicians and patients to examine primary care's rapid adoption of digital health and the subsequent impact on 1) access to care, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with vital relationships between patients and care teams. Examination of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much-needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.","Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19",10193445,R01HS028253,[''],AHRQ,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,491317
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,10167757,U24HG003345,"['Biology ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Chickens ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Communication ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' P450 ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Family ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gene Duplication ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Glutathione S-Transferase ', ' EC 2.5.1.18 ', ' Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase ', ' Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aryltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase ', ' Glutathione Transferase ', ' Heme Transfer Protein ', ' Ligandins ', ' S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase ', ' glutathione aralkyltransferase ', ' glutathione aryltransferase ', ' Goals ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' detoxification ', ' Study models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Process Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Descriptor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' school violence ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' youth violence ', ' teen violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' school violence prevention ', ' prevent school violence ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' study population ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Crime ', ' Dropout ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' ']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950
"Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem Abstract Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) is a growing multibillion-dollar industry leveraging a wide range of clinical, genomic, social, geographical, web-based, and wearable device data for improvements in health outcomes broadly circumscribed under the term “precision health.” Powered by Big Data, characterized by volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value, “big knowledge” in the form of AI-CDS is becoming increasingly ubiquitous (volume), rapidly developing (velocity), available to a wide range of medical fields (variety), based on data from a wide range of sources that reflects the health of individuals and populations (veracity), and focused on lowering costs and promoting better health outcomes (value). Current policy paradigms for CDS, including whether to classify it as a medical device, are not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence technologies. Patients and providers have no reasonable way to discern how these “black box” technologies operate or their accuracy. Innovative policies (e.g. standards in product labeling) that address these concerns are likely to require direct consumer outreach and communications to ensure public trust in the growing AI-CDS field. Indeed, public trust in AI-CDS has been identified as a top priority for the AI- CDS big knowledge ecosystem by the National Academy of Medicine, NIH, FDA, and OMB, among others. Trust is particularly salient given the range of critical ethical and policy considerations related to transparency, privacy, non-maleficence, equity, accountability, and utility of AI-CDS. In Aim 1 of our proposed study, we will measure the public's current trust in AI-CDS for precision health and assess (a) its relationship to the public's expectations and concerns about privacy, equity, non-maleficence, responsibility, and utility and (b) how it may be affected by policies and practices, such as labeling or certification. In Aim 2 we will use deliberative democracy methods and expert interviews, designed to directly inform policy and standards that address perceived risks of AI-CDS and in Aim 3 we propose to develop a product information label that would both increase transparency and accessibility of information about AI-CDS for patients and providers. The continued acceptance and adoption of AI-CDS is predicated on public trust and our proposal provides a research-focused and evidence-based approach to incorporating public participation into emerging national standards. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed project is to address the gap in current research on public perspectives about ethical best practices and the impact of Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) on the trust of the public. We propose to focus on policy and practice options such as certification, notification, and product labeling related to essential, endemic issues in the AI-CDS ecosystem: transparency, privacy, equity, non- maleficence, accountability, and utility (Aim 1 and Aim 2). For Aim 3, we evaluate key attributes for product labeling and an accompanying multi-dimensional metric of trust reflective of the Food and Drug Administration's system of categorizing software used as a medical device.",Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem,10092723,R01EB030492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Certification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Participation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Accountability ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Competence ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Notification ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' British ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' non-maleficence ', ' Nonmaleficence ', ' Melissa ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Security ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' point of care ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' public trust ', ' deliberative democracy ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' data sharing ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' individualized oncology ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' health data ', ' learning network ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,700766
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10143312,R44MH125238,"['Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Depth Perception ', ' Stereopsis ', ' Stereoscopic Vision ', ' visual depth perception ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Resort ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Visual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' structural biology ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Coupling ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' optogenetics ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' feature detection ', ' feature recognition ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Visualization ', ' 3D virtual reality ', ' 3-D virtual reality ', ' 3-dimensional virtual reality ', ' three-dimensional virtual reality ', ' data dissemination ', ' adaptation algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data exploration ', ' ']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2021,467258
"Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans Project Summary The long-term goal of this research is to establish a pipeline for automated image processing that enhances cadaveric non-contrast enhanced (NCE) CT data and extracts meaningful models and metrics to improve anatomy research and education. The objective is to develop the necessary toolset for this image processing, and feature extraction. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to enrich the information content of biomedical imaging data, particularly that of cadaveric NCE CT imaging, for use in gross anatomy education and research. The rationale behind this project is that cadaveric dissection, while an important part of anatomy education, is limited due to sample size, infrastructure, cost, and time. Biomedical imaging can preserve specimens for posterity and be used to supplement this material by providing statistical and quantitative information from anatomical structures. This research will attempt to establish a working pipeline for efficient information extraction through the following specific aims: (1) Improving inter-observer anatomical agreement in cadaveric CT scans; (2) Develop an approach to automatically segment anatomical structures from non-contrast enhanced CT images; and (3) Establish normal variation of anatomical structures and its relationship to pathologies. This project is innovative because it applies artificial intelligence to efficiently extract anatomical information from cadaveric NCE CT imaging, which has only been performed with traditional registration- dependent methods that often fail and are domain specific, acting on a single organ at a time. In addition, this project works with multi-species data to enhance human image data.  This project is significant because it will allow students to understand anatomical variation better by both expanding student exposure to more samples, while also extracting useful representations and analytics from these samples for education and research. The expected outcome of this project is a toolset that is capable of enhancing anatomy education and research by increasing soft-tissue contrast, automatically segmenting the kidneys, liver, mandible, and intraosseus sites of the cranial nerves, and performing statistical analysis on these organs, including but not limited to statistical shape modelling and shape analysis. This will have a positive impact on anatomical education and student retention because it will provide students with a broader range of sample variability information which will decrease pervading biases in medical training that result from small, limited sample sizes, and improve medical training. Project Narrative Dissection is a critical component of anatomy education but is limited due to the infrastructure required by the institution, the amount of variability in the available specimens, and the limited number of specimens available within the course. Biomedical imaging and analysis can be used to supplement dissection, allowing for an expansion in the number of anatomical specimens that students can observe and the amount of clinically relevant material that is available to students to improve their understanding of pathology and variation.

In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",10116983,U01CA239055,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Histology ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Lymphatic cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' lymph cell ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mitosis ', ' M Phase ', ' Mitosis Stage ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Paper ', ' Clinical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' photonics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' ASCO ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' learning network ', ' interactive tool ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Nivolumab ', ' Opdivo ', ' Visualization ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' Prognosis ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,204945
"Develop a large-scale library of comprehensive deformable image registration (DIR) benchmark datasets and an integrated framework for quantifying accuracy of patient-specific DIR results Summary  Deformable image registration (DIR) between different image sets acquired from the same patient is a key enabling technology for many important diagnostic and therapeutic tasks, e.g. tumor diagnosis, evaluation of tumor response to treatment, and image-guided surgery. DIR algorithms compute tissue deformation by maximizing intensity and/or structural similarity between moving and target images, and regularity of deformation. DIR accuracy, which is the voxel-level positional correspondence between the two images, is not guaranteed, often inadequate, unpredictable and patient specific. DIR accuracy is largely dependent on anatomical site, image modality and quality, algorithm designs and implementations, operator skills and workflow selections. Inaccurate DIRs can have significant deleterious impact clinical decisions, treatment quality and patient safety. Lack of confidence in current registration tools has significantly limited the broader use of DIR in automating clinical decision-making tasks and improving diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes.  We posit that lack of accurate or robust performance arises from the fact that current DIR algorithms are based upon overly simplistic models of tissue deformation and failure to accommodate the reality of CT image quality. Currently, no method exists for quantitatively and automatically evaluating patient- specific DIR accuracy. We are therefore motivated to conduct two studies: 1) Build a large and comprehensive library of DIR benchmark datasets to support DIR algorithm validation in challenging settings. Each new DIR benchmark dataset will consist of automatically and  precisely detected landmark pairs, small blood vessel section pairs, and segmentation of organs and  large blood vessels. Currently no such DIR benchmark dataset exist. These datasets will spur  development of new and advanced DIR algorithms able to support complex, patient-specific tissue  deformation. These datasets will be immensely valuable for applications beyond DIR such as  semantic segmentation and vessels extraction, etc. 2) Develop integrated methods for quantitative verification of patient-specific DIRs. The automatic DIR  verification procedure will use multiple novel deep-learning models for automatic organ  segmentation, vessel bifurcation detection and direct prediction of 3D vector field of TREs (target  registration error). These to-be-developed deep-learning-based image processing procedures are  robust with respect to image noise and intensity variations, and will naturally support many  anatomical sites. This DIR verification procedure will provide quality assurance for patient-specific  DIRs for supporting clinical applications. Project Narrative  Inaccurate deformable image registration (DIR) can have significant deleterious impacts on clinical decisions. In this proposal, we will develop 1) a large-scale library of comprehensive DIR benchmark datasets to facilitate DIR research by objective, comprehensive, and quantitative performance assessment of new and advanced DIR methods designed to better model tissue deformation in challenging settings; and 2) a novel integrated process for automatically and quantitatively evaluating patient-specific DIRs, enabling physicians to confidently use such registrations to improve targeting accuracy of image-guided interventions and clinical decision-making tasks.",Develop a large-scale library of comprehensive deformable image registration (DIR) benchmark datasets and an integrated framework for quantifying accuracy of patient-specific DIR results,10121241,R01EB029431,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Libraries ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Physicians ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Organ ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' diagnosis evaluation ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' intraoperative imaging ', ' surgical imaging ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' patient safety ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' image guided intervention ', ' image registration ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' targeted imaging ', ' clinical imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1685767
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",10146309,R01CA240551,"['Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Belief ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Paper ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural health care ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' digital health ', ' smoking-related disease ', ' smoking-related disorder ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,644137
"UniProt: A Protein Sequence and Function Resource for Biomedical Science PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project continues the development of the UniProt Knowledgebase, which aims to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality, and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional information. Proteins are an essential bridge between human genetics, the environment and phenotype. While human genetics has increasing power to find correlations between genotype and phenotype, knowledge of how proteins function, provided by UniProt, is essential for the mechanistic understanding critical to develop health outcomes through improved and personalized diagnostics, prognostics, and treatments. Biomedical research is being revolutionized by methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning (ML) approaches such as Deep Learning (DL). These approaches now outstrip the ability of humans in many fields and are state-of-the-art when sufficient data is available. UniProt provides gold standard training data for hundreds of ML applications in biomedical research. The work in this proposal will enhance the readiness of UniProt for use in ML and will integrate ML methods to enhance our efficiency. UniProt curators extract and synthesize experimental knowledge of proteins from papers in human and machine- readable forms using a range of standard ontologies. This proposal will further structure protein knowledge in UniProt, developing complete, machine-readable catalogs of the functional impact of human variation and of human protein networks and complexes, essential to understanding human disease. Efficiency of curation will be improved using DL models, developed in collaboration with text mining experts, to automate the identification of relevant papers and accelerate extraction of knowledge. This extracted knowledge will be validated by our expert curators and also the wider research community who will be actively engaged to further scale curation. ML approaches will also be used to infer annotations for proteins with no experimental characterization, using community challenges to develop faster, more accurate, scalable approaches to annotate the deluge of uncharacterized proteins. UniProt is an exemplar FAIR resource and has served the scientific community with metronomic data releases despite an exponential growth in data volumes. Streamlined production processes will scale efficiently and sustainably with both the growing data volume and complexity. We will explore novel technologies to ensure the continued timely release of data to the community according to the FAIR principles. UniProt is an international hub of protein data that serves hundreds of thousands of users annually. We will continue using user-centric approaches to develop the UniProt website in response to user needs and new data types. We will engage with our stakeholders and collaborators by introducing an annual strategic partnership meeting. We will engage our communities through webinars, social media, hackathons and attendance at scientific meetings to broaden the efficient and impactful use of our data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Proteins shape our cells, tissues, and organs in response to the complex interplay of genomics with environmental and developmental cues, and thereby hold the key to understanding how individual genomic variation affects our phenotype, disease susceptibility, and drug responses. UniProt provides a reference resource that efficiently standardizes and organizes knowledge of proteins and their functions in forms that both humans and machines can understand and interpret.

"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function.

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10242048,R21EY031725,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Axon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Savings ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Structure ', ' glaucoma test ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' treatment strategy ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' dashboard ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' Visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Prognosis ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2021,191826
"Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM Project Summary/ Abstract Prisms of Reality seeks to develop and assess the impact and feasibility of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) learning platform that targets high-leverage pain points in the secondary math and science curriculum to support a more diverse and well-equipped healthcare workforce. Our platform engages students in self-directed scientific inquiry using compelling real world contexts that develop empirical decision-making skills with regards to key issues in public health. In Phase I, we will design an IVR learning module for high school Algebra that emphasizes how mathematical modeling of ultraviolet rays using trigonometric functions can be applied to reason quantitatively about the risks posed by ozone depletion, which led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In the face of ever changing climate change regulations, our module will ensure students are capable of flexibly applying quantitative models in support of policies that advance public health outcomes while improving proficiency on math and science skills that preclude so many from continuing their education in STEM, specifically in the medical fields. There is evidence that IVR increases motivation and engagement, but applications in learning that empirically improve student outcomes have proven to be elusive. Therefore, the development of a pedagogical framework in IVR that leads to enduring understanding and increased achievement will be ground-breaking for STEM teaching and learning. Our platform employs constructivist, gamified narratives that foster “hands on” student discovery and 3D sense-making of natural phenomena and mathematical models tied to public health issues. Through holistic data collection and analytics, our teacher-facing learning management system will track each student’s conceptual progress and provide individualized feedback. If successful, Prisms’ platform will not only transform the student experience and achievement, but will provide a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualized through IVR to yield meaningful student outcomes. To develop the platform, in Phase I Prisms will a) design a robust game-based pedagogical framework that harnesses innovative features unique to VR to cultivate deep conceptual flexibility and abstract reasoning skills based on authentic real world problems; b) explore effective VR functionalities, experience design, and development techniques for high quality implementation using the cost-effective Oculus Quest; c) implement a teacher-facing learning management system that will provide teachers data-driven insights about student learning in order to support individualized feedback and intervention; and d) evaluate productive user experience & empirically measure our platform’s impact on learning outcomes in authentic classroom settings. Project Narrative The goal of our Phase I research is to iteratively design and rigorously evaluate the impact of an immersive virtual reality learning module in demonstrating how mathematical modelling and reasoning can support the implementation of public health policies like the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which mitigated increased rates in skin cancer, cataracts and other genetic damages due to ozone depletion. Students have often been susceptible to the misuse of quantitative models, which our platform will address through immersive opportunities for students to engage with interdisciplinary, real world problems that impact individual and collective health. Ultimately, we aim to empower a diverse and technically versatile healthcare workforce, while ensuring that all students are equipped with the tools necessary to make empirical decisions about the public health issues of today and the future.","Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM",10252740,R43GM142301,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Awareness ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Ultraviolet Rays ', ' Actinic Rays ', ' UV light ', ' UV radiation ', ' UV rays ', ' ultra violet light ', ' ultra violet radiation ', ' ultra violet rays ', ' ultraviolet light ', ' ultraviolet radiation ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' technique development ', ' Drops ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' iterative design ', ' mathematical theory ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' math theory ', ' mathematic theory ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics theory ', ' individualized feedback ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Algebra ', ' Quantitative Reasoning ', ' Geometry ', ' cloud based ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' algebraic concepts ', ' algebraic reasoning ', ' algebraic theory ', ' algebraic thinking ', ' student participation ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' constructivism ', ' constructivist ', ' learning outcome ', ' pedagogy ', ' personalized learning ', ' trigonometry ', ' trigonometric ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' dashboard ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Visualization ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRISMS OF REALITY INC.,R43,2021,230629
"NNLM Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services National Center for Data Science Abstract Scientific progress is impeded when researchers lack the knowledge and skills to engage in effective data management, reproducible research practices, and meaningful data sharing. A growing number of librarians are providing support for best practices in data management and data science, but there is still tremendous untapped potential across the library community. The Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services (NCDS) will coordinate national efforts to provide training and resources to increase capacity among librarians to support two of the National Library of Medicine’s strategic goals: 1) accelerate discovery and advance health by providing the tools for data-driven research, and 2) build a workforce for data-driven research and health. The NCDS team brings a broad set of data skills to this undertaking, as well as experience in successful development of institutional data support and in developing resources for, training, and mentoring librarians on the national level. The NCDS will work collaboratively with the NNLM’s Regional Medical Libraries, Offices and Centers (ROCs), draw upon extensive connections with national data organizations to increase outreach and partner on programming, and assemble an external advisory board with expertise in clinical informatics, bioinformatics, community engagement, machine learning, data ethics, and open science to solicit feedback on our efforts and to maintain awareness of a breadth of current data issues. The NCDS will partner with the National Evaluation Center (NEC) to better understand the needs of the communities we are serving, ensure that training, resources, and support are designed and delivered in ways that meet those needs, generate information on best practices, and evaluate the achievement of the program aims. The proposed education programs will emphasize careful curation of existing content over “reinventing the wheel” in order to build resources such as an online Data Roadmap for self-directed learning and a repository of curricular resources. The NCDS will also focus on support for knowledge application and consolidation, offering courses with coaching to assist in bringing knowledge into practice and training in coding followed by codeathons to consolidate knowledge. Other programming will include a series of unconferences to support community building and development of resources. We will develop a pipeline program to provide data librarianship internships to Library and Information Science and college students from communities currently underrepresented in the profession. The NCDS will take advantage of multiple channels to communicate, including website, blogs, and social media, as well as collaborating with the ROCs and external partner organizations for outreach. The NCDS will use a coordinated, data-driven, innovative approach, to build capacity for providing data services among health information professionals, and in this way facilitate efficient and reproducible research and promote greater collaboration. Project Narrative Scientific progress towards improving public health is impeded when researchers lack the skills to collect data in a way that will allow results to be reproduced, analyze data efficiently through use of the best available tools, and share data so that it can be found and used by others for further research.

"Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD Project Summary Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP. Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders. Project Narrative Nearly half of patients do not recover following the first line of treatment for OCD, exposure and response prevention (ERP). This study proposes to test a novel method of augmenting ERP, a computerized, scalable intervention targeting interpretation bias, which is a critical mechanism underlying OCD. The overall goal is to contribute to the development of technology-driven augmentations to ERP to enhance response rates, which may generalize to treatment for other OC-related and anxiety disorders in the future.",Interpretation Bias as a Mechanism of Treatment Response in OCD,10368212,K23MH126193,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' mental health facility ', ' Interviewer ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Training ', ' Obsession ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' recruit ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' kernel methods ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' treatment as prevention ', ' treatment-based prevention ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,K23,2021,181480
"Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision Abstract. The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention of tick bites remains the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this approach. No automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to develop the first imaging and automated identification system capable of instantaneously and accurately identifying the top nine tick vectors in the US. This proposal will first characterize the optical requirements necessary to image diagnostic morphological features associated with adult ticks and develop a standardized imaging platform for tick identification. This will enable the development of a high-quality tick image dataset in partnership with the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU) which will be used to train high-accuracy computer vision models for tick species and sex identification. Ultimately the approaches developed here will enable new tick identification tools for both the lab and citizen scientists; allowing vector surveillance managers to leverage image recognition in a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equipping citizen scientists with improved tools to identify tick species during a human-tick encounter. Project Narrative. Despite the importance of tick vector surveillance for disease prevention, current practices to collect and identify specimens are resource intensive, limiting the quality and quantity of the data informing control efforts. Here we propose the determination of optical requirements for visualization of diagnostic features of the top nine US tick vectors, and the development of high-accuracy computer vision algorithms for the identification of tick species and sex for use in a standardized optical configuration.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics. This node will support clinical trials relevant to the epidemics and also advance research in novel models of care, data analytics, mobile interventions and training.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10335544,UG1DA049467,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aging ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Professional Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Indiana ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' healthcare professional practice ', ' Public Health ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' suburb ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Homelessness ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' cooking ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' Remote Education ', ' Distance Education ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' telehealth ', ' Health system ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Research Training ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' digital ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' collaborative care ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' population health ', ' waiver ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Data Analytics ', ' adolescent health ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' substance misuse ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid treatment program ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' sexual identity ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2021,116680
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Project Abstract Karst terrains show distinctive surface and subsurface features associated with sinkholes, springs, and caves. Many of the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics associated with these features make groundwater systems in karst areas a significant freshwater resource for human consumption and ecological integrity. Unfortunately, these characteristics also make karst aquifers highly vulnerable to contamination. Karst springs, specifically, provide researchers insight to the interaction between input precipitation, karst aquifers as the transmission medium, and discharge as the output response. A karst catchment area or spring catchment is a mapping unit defined by the surface area and the subsurface drain system that contributes to spring discharge. Therefore, being able to determine this catchment area, and understand how hydrologic conditions in karst environments affect contaminant fate and transport in springs, is crucial to establishing effective source water protection areas (SWPAs) to safeguard groundwater and public health. However, due to the inherent complexity of karst systems, it has been challenging for the PROTECT team to (1) forecast spring response, and (2) infer subsurface properties from surface features in karst environments, since both require the application of advanced computational techniques, such as big data analytics and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Hence, the proposed project for the KC Donnelly Externship award will allow me to train along with Mr. Sean Griffin and his team on the core concepts and models behind geospatial artificial intelligence to automate object detection, object classification, and feature extraction from remotely sensed imagery. Mastering the application of ML algorithms will allow me to discover patterns in my research data, and to construct predictive mathematical models using these discoveries.

"Next generation axonal quantification and classification using AI Abstract This Lab to Marketplace project describes the development of HyperAxon™, highly innovative software for performing automated segmentation, tracing, reconstruction and quantitative analysis of all axonal fibers visible in three-dimensional (3D) microscopic images of central nervous system (CNS) areas, even those with extremely high axonal fiber density. Accurate and rigorous analysis of all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS tissue of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models as well as in human post mortem CNS tissue holds the promise of novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, this cannot be achieved with contemporary, computer-assisted tracing and reconstruction methods, which currently are the gold standard for investigating axonal fibers, because these methods primarily address tracing and reconstruction of only a limited number of individual axonal fibers. HyperAxon will be based on the highly innovative artificial intelligence technology Learning-based Tracing of Dense Axonal Fibers (LTDAF) that was recently developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) (Lexington, MA). This project will build upon the original, lab-built LTDAF technology to create commercial software for wide- spread dissemination of this important new technology. Dissemination of this technology via a Lab to Marketplace commercial product is consistent with NIMH goals and will result in the technology having a significant impact on neuroscience research. The game-changing innovation in HyperAxon is the ability to automatically (i) segment, trace and reconstruct all axonal fibers visible in 3D microscopic images of CNS areas with high axonal fiber density, (ii) identify axonal branch points, (iii) resolve axonal fibers of passage from axonal fibers that make presumptive synapses in target regions, (iv) identify axonal fibers showing acute axonal injury and (v) precisely quantify alterations in number and density of axonal fibers in CNS tissue. Based on published pilot work performed at MIT LL, we are convinced that HyperAxon will be impactful in the field of neuroscience research and will enable substantial advancements in research on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of HyperAxon for commercial release. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of HyperAxon in close collaboration with MIT LL and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not available. Narrative Accurate and rigorous analysis of all visible axonal fibers in 3D microscopic images of central nervous system (CNS) tissue of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models as well as in human postmortem CNS tissue holds the promise of novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using a number of technical innovations that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform such studies automatically and in a comprehensive manner. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.",Next generation axonal quantification and classification using AI,10324805,R43MH128076,"['Transgenic Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Axon ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' treatment strategy ', ' operation ', ' axon injury ', ' axon damage ', ' axonal damage ', ' axonal injury ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' terabyte ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,420391
"A Novel Device for Training and Evaluating Ultrasound-Guided Procedures In Anesthesia Project Summary The use of ultrasound for interventional guidance has expanded significantly over the past decade and has become an important tool in clinical specialties such as Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine and Sports Medicine. In interventional ultrasound, there are significant challenges introduced by the necessity of simultaneously visualizing the target and the needle with a single B-mode probe, keeping the nondominant hand steady while finding the correct trajectory of the needle in the dominant hand. The resulting alignment problem (probe, instrument, target) is a different skill problem than identifying structures in ultrasound and requires specialized training. Current training systems do not provide suitable information to aid the novice user in developing key hand-eye coordination skills and their retention. For this reason, we propose to design the EDU –comprised of an Interson ultrasound, a tablet computer with guidance software, a CGM Optical Head with tiny video cameras, and a CGM custom nerve block phantom-- as a learning platform for developing key skills in needle acquisition, accuracy of needle placement, and understanding needle-to-ultrasound-plane orientation. The use of tiny video cameras on the ultrasound enable computer algorithms to compute the trajectory differences between an experienced user performing one of the regional blocks and a student’s attempt. The differences between the paths to the target allow some quantification of the skills, which may be helpful in giving feedback to the student during the semester, and perhaps also to develop a benchmark for CME courses. A second aim of this proposal is to study whether learning with needle-guidance software is beneficial to student skill acquisition and/or confidence. This proposal would study a cohort of student registered nurse anesthetists during a semester course teaching five progressively more difficult nerve blocks/procedures. With this novel system, quantifiable metrics can be harnessed to demonstrate whether learning with guidance is helpful, even when the guidance is removed, and whether it can lead to more consistent procedures across students. Using proprietary custom- made phantoms, the progressive difficulty levels of the five procedures can show whether guidance can be more helpful in more difficult blocs or if it can help in all.

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all.

"Computerized assessment of linguistic indicators of lucidity in Alzheimer's Disease dementia Project Summary The focus of the parent project (AG069792) is to enable automated detection and analysis of episodes of unexpected lucidity in individuals with late-stage dementia in which the individual long thought to have succumbed to dementia and lost most of his or her cognitive abilities temporarily regains the ability to communicate in a clear and coherent fashion. Towards this goal, this project aims to develop a) technology for automatic conversion of speech produced by patients with dementia to text and b) measures of semantic coherence from the transcribed text. The development of this technology relies on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods including deep learning and time series analysis. We are currently developing these approaches using existing datasets including the Carolina Conversations Corpus (CCC), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and Dementia Bank (DB) which contain audio and text transcripts of conversational interviews with patients with dementia of varying severity and healthy controls. Currently, the researchers in the AI/ML community use these resources by following individually developed pre-processing procedures that are partially described in publications resulting from their work and ad hoc code made available in multiple repositories. The results obtained by various investigators can be difficult to compare because of individual differences in how the data were processed and prepared for ML experimentation. For the one-year supplement project, we propose to create an open-source platform consisting of tools that will ingest original data available from DB, WLS, and CCC datasets and convert them to be AI/ML-ready in keeping with the current best practices in the AI/ML community. This project seeks to develop a validated tool approach to automatically monitoring people with advanced dementia who are thought to have lost their cognitive abilities for potential episodes in which they unexpectedly and temporarily regain their ability to communicate coherently.

"Varieties of Impulsivity in Opiate and Stimulant Users Project Summary Impulsivity has gained prominence as one of the cardinal etiological risk factors for the development and maintenance of addictive disorders. However, both impulsivity and addiction are highly heterogeneous, which has hampered progress in understanding the link between the two. To address this heterogeneity, we have developed a program of addiction research in Bulgaria, a major European center for production of synthetic amphetamine-type stimulants and a key transit country for heroin trafficking, due to its strategic geographical position on the Balkan Drug Route. Through our 17-yearlong collaboration with Bulgarian colleagues, we have accessed rare populations of predominantly monosubstance-dependent (‘pure’) heroin and amphetamine users, many in protracted abstinence. In the parent DA021421 study, we have tested >800 participants with a comprehensive assessment battery of clinical, personality, and neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity and related externalizing and internalizing phenotypes. We genotyped participants with the Smokescreen array and enrolled siblings discordant for opiate and stimulant addictions. We combined theory-driven (e.g. cognitive modeling, joint modeling) with data-driven (e.g. machine learning (ML)) computational approaches, which proved particularly informative and revealed distinct multivariate risk profiles characterizing opiate and stimulant addictions with high degree of accuracy. Findings from the parent study significantly informed our integrative multidisciplinary framework (Vassileva & Conrod, 2019), which highlights the potential for distinct dimensions of impulsivity to inform clinical assessment and intervention development for different types of addictions. Impulsivity also figures prominently in the neuroscience-based heuristic framework for the neuroclinical assessment of addictions (ANA; Kwako et al., 2016), which proposes that successful addiction treatment must accommodate the heterogeneity and different etiological mechanisms implicated in addictions, by performing multidimensional assessments focusing on three neurofunctional domains of impulsivity and compulsivity: executive function (EF), incentive salience (IS), and negative emotionality (NE). However, because the ANA framework is based primarily on findings in alcohol use disorder, it is not well understood how these domains might generalize to other SUD, such as opiate and stimulant use disorders. The current competing renewal application aims to address this critical gap with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify key personality, neurobehavioral, polygenic, and computational markers of opiate and stimulant addiction following the ANA framework, using the comprehensive assessment battery and computational methods developed in the parent DA021421 with 250 participants (100 with opiate use disorder, 100 with stimulant use disorder, and 50 healthy controls); Aim 2: Identify the brain signatures of the 3 ANA domains (EF, IS, NE) in opiate and stimulant addictions; Exploratory Aim 3: Combine data from Aims 1 and 2 to identify addiction biotypes based on neurocircuitry implicated in the ANA domains. Project Narrative: Opiate and stimulant addictions remain significant public health problems worldwide. Despite revolutionary advances in our understanding of their neurobiological basis, much remains to be learned about different etiological factors underlying addiction heterogeneity. We have identified a unique cohort of substance users characterized by predominantly monosubstance-dependent patterns of opiate and stimulant use and by protracted abstinence, which may help decipher some of the neurobiological risk factors associated with different types of addiction.",Varieties of Impulsivity in Opiate and Stimulant Users,10299799,R01DA021421,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Amphetamines ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Bulgaria ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Personality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Siblings ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Amphetamine Users ', ' European ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' psychostimulant addiction ', ' stimulant addiction ', ' stimulant dependence ', ' Psychostimulant dependence ', ' heuristics ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' Heroin Users ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' pharmacobehavioral ', ' behavioral pharmacology ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Balkans ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' incentive salience ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' reward anticipation ', ' opioid user ', ' Opiate user ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' PWUO ', ' people who use opioids ', ' persons who use opioids ', ' stimulant use ', ' stimulant use disorder ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' substance user ', ' ']",NIDA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,569075
"DS-I Africa - LAW Project Summary/Abstract The proposed project will have a strong focus on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa. Accordingly, the proposed project is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. Without knowledge of the law, scientists risk starting a health research project only to later find the data that they have generated cannot be used as planned; without knowledge of the law, scientists risk wasting resources, legal liability, and even criminal sanctions. Accordingly, scientists need clarity regarding the `hard' law that governs the use of data in health research. The law can often be multi- layered, complex, and may differ between jurisdictions. Therefore, to facilitate health discovery and innovation that uses data science, legal clarity will be provided on a variety of critical legal themes, listed below. The expected output of the proposed project will be practical guides for scientists on how to be legally compliant with regard to each of these themes. The impact will be that scientists who plan projects using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa (or with African collaborators) will be empowered to take the required actions to be legally compliant. The proposed project will have a broad jurisdictional scope, involving the law of twelve African nations. Five critical legal themes will be investigated over a three-year period: (1) modes of informed consent to the use of data; (2) the nature and content of individual and community rights in genomic data; (3) the use of persons' geospatial data for public health surveillance; (4) the cross-border sharing of data; and (5) the use of data as basis for Artificial Intelligence (AI). An important cross-cutting theme and goal of the proposed project is the decolonization and Africanization of extant law related to the use of data in health research. The proposed project will critically engage with the extant law of the twelve jurisdictions from the perspective of current trends in African legal philosophy. The expected outcomes are recommendations for legal innovation and inter- jurisdiction harmonization. The impact of these recommendations will be to empower policymakers in Africa to make the relevant law more attuned to the needs and expectations of the people of Africa. The project team consist of leading law academics from different regions in Africa – boasting with a collective publication record of 148 articles in peer-reviewed journals. The team's core expertise is the legal regulation of data, and African legal philosophy. Accordingly, the team is perfectly positioned to successfully execute the proposed project. Project Narrative The proposed project focuses on the legal dimensions of using data science for health discovery and innovation in Africa, and is intended to complement other ELSI projects that may focus more on the ethical and social implications. The proposed project will provide legal clarity and practical guidance on issues that are critical for scientists, and make recommendations for legal innovation and inter-jurisdiction harmonization through the lens of decolonization and Africanization.

"A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The goals of the IGVF Data Administrative and Coordinating Center (DACC) are to support the IGVF Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the project’s science. By creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community, the DACC provides a critical connection between scientific producers and consumers. The IGVF Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via novel experimental assays, often focusing at the single-cell level of gene expression. This work is extended and regularized by laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover the associations and networks between human variation, chromosomal elements and molecular phenotypes for the purpose of elucidating their complex relationship in human cells and tissues. The DACC’s participation enhances the data created by the consortium through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created, the DACC will construct a state of the art data warehouse, design and develop robust software to enable data submission, and harden unified data processing pipelines. All experimental and computational results will be made available via the IGVF Portal, developed by the DACC. The Portal will integrate these data resources and provide enhanced search and browsing capabilities, along with powerful web services. The DACC will develop tools for semantically-enhanced graph-based searches of experiment metadata, individual genomic elements, variation and phenotype, and will implement methods to distribute these results in matrices suitable for machine learning. Beyond computational infrastructure to house and distribute consortium data, the DACC will also function as the administrative hub of the IGVF. Consortium science thrives on clear and forthright communication between its component parts, and it is the DACC’s responsibility to manage this relationship. This effort will be facilitated by management of consortium working groups, organization of scientific results and publications, and providing regular reporting and feedback to the Steering committee. To fully support the community, the DACC will act as a service organization, allowing biomedical research to take full advantage of the results from the IGVF. To this end, the DACC will organize and host consortium- focused and user-focused meetings, and will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The various component projects of the IGVF (DACC, mapping, systematic characterization, genetic network regulation, modeling of genomic variation centers and groups) will be tightly woven together to create the IGVF Consortium. Relevance to Public Health, Project Narrative Through this project we will create a Data Administration and Coordinating Center (DACC) for the NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation and Function (IGVF), which promises to transform our understanding of the associations between genetic variation and phenotype. Our proposed DACC will serve as the primary administration, communication, outreach and data center for IGVF awardees and provide leadership for standards and processing pipeline implementation, and facilitate FAIR databases and software. Due to our cross-cutting and unparalleled technical expertise in data management, genomics, informatics, network analysis, and privacy-preserving application as well as our role leading a large data coordination center, managing, coordinating data and metadata, as well as creating gold standard knowledgebases, Stanford is in a strong position to serve as the IGVF DACC.",A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium,10296944,U24HG012012,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' scientific organization ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' distributed data ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' verification and validation ', ' genomic variation ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data resource ', ' service organization ', ' data warehouse ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' data centers ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' complex data ', ' privacy preservation ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' implementation facilitation ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,2739389
"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arizona ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Work Simplification ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' Accent ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' real world application ', ' information processing ', ' clinical practice ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' interactive tool ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' recruit ', ' intelligent personal assistant ', ' digital assistant ', ' intelligent assistant ', ' personal digital assistant ', ' virtual assistant ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' clinical encounter ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905
"Annual Conference on Health IT & Analytics 2021-2023 Project Summary Driven by the continuing digitization of medical information, innovations in information technology and applications of artificial intelligence, and policy developments, the healthcare landscape is changing dramatically. New opportunities and challenges emerge daily regarding the design, implementation, management, use, and evaluation of Health IT and Analytics (HITA), and in particular, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, to support the mission of fostering a learning healthcare system, which promotes evidence-based improvements in healthcare quality, patient safety, whole-person care, affordability and access. These digital healthcare innovations represent significant and unprecedented translational research opportunities, which have the potential to influence practitioners, policymakers and consumers. As the use of AI in healthcare grows it is essential to solve issues surrounding the ethical, unbiased, and appropriate implementation and use of AI towards clinical, patient empowerment, and administrative knowledge needs.

"Deep learning tools for the automated analysis of hematopathology whole slide images and the development of prognostic algorithms for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis and its examination is central to the diagnosis and management of patients with hematological diseases. Pathology slides from clinical hematopathology services represent a treasure trove of real-world data on the biology of human bone marrow. However, human examination is time-intensive and limited in its quantitative precision, preventing our ability to perform large- scale studies or identify new morphologic markers of disease. Machine learning and image processing methods can be applied to the analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs), which will lead to improvements in our understanding of the hematological system, as well as our ability to diagnose and manage hematological diseases.  The objective of this research is to build deep learning-based tools for the automated classification of bone marrow aspirates and use these tools to study hematopoiesis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The central hypothesis is that automated methods can be developed for the classification, characterization, and quantification of cell morphology on human bone marrow aspirates and that these tools can identify morphologic features predictive of outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The long-term goal is to develop a suite of artificial intelligence tools for the quantitative analysis of hematopathology WSIs that can be used to improve our understanding of hematopoiesis and our management of patients with hematologic diseases through the development of digital hematopathology tools, stains, and biomarkers for research and clinical applications. This approach is innovative because it applies cutting-edge image analysis technology to the quantitative and scalable study of human bone marrow specimens from clinical pathology archives to drive discovery of new biological insights and clinical biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our understanding of human hematopoiesis, hematological diseases and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation relies on morphologic examination of the bone marrow. Deep learning methods applied to human bone marrow whole-slide images from clinical services will improve our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and our ability to diagnose and treat hematological conditions, by enabling automated and standardized quantitation of morphologic features, which can then be applied to clinical slide archives and associated with clinical outcomes. We propose to build tools for the automated classification and morphologic characterization of normal bone marrow cells, and to apply these tools to study patients who have received hematopoietic stem cell transplants, allowing us to examine the process of hematopoiesis in human bone marrow after transplant and identify features predictive of transplant outcome.",Deep learning tools for the

"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10219269,K99EY030942,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' South Korea ', ' Republic of Korea ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Standardization ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Supervision ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' tomography ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' POAG ', ' Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' legally blind ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical care ', ' standard measure ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2021,117347

"Genomic risk in clinic care to promote health equity in New York City patients PROJECT SUMMARY Building on our track record in genomic research, clinical trials, and genomic medicine in diverse, underserved patients from NYC, we propose to develop new frameworks to bring genomic risk into clinical care to promote health equity. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are entering an exciting phase where they are poised to improve health outcomes for myriad complex diseases through enhanced risk stratification and clinical decision making. However, major challenges exist for clinical PRS implementation today. The vast majority of PRS have far greater predictive value in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries, and issues of access to leading-edge genomic technology, research, and testing disproportionately impact underserved populations. To address this, Mount Sinai experts in statistical genetics and population genetics, with decade-long experience in building methods tailored to diverse and admixed populations, will work together to rigorously develop multi-ethnic PRS. We will integrate multi-ethnic PRS with standard clinical risk and family history information to generate genomic risk assessments for 15 common diseases. Drawing on Mount Sinai's century of experience serving one of the most diverse patient populations in the world, we will recruit 2,500 adult and pediatric patients from diverse and underserved populations into a clinical trial. We will estimate participants' individualized risk for each condition, and investigate the impact of genomic risk communication to patients and their physicians, including patient understanding and uptake of recommended risk-reducing interventions. We will explore attitudes, barriers, and communication preferences related to genomic risk assessment in diverse populations. Knowledge gained will be used to guide the development of a new multilingual patient-facing digital platform supporting patient education and communication of genomic risk. We will track patient engagement with their results through the platform, and assess the impact of individualized genomic risk assessments on patient-reported psychosocial outcomes and experiences. As of today, the path to effectively integrate genomic risk into clinical care in busy health systems, particularly for diverse patients, is unclear. Hence, we are partnering with clinicians, scientists, industry experts, and community stakeholders to explore a range of strategies to assess, communicate, and reduce disease risk, in order to maximize the efficiency of genomic medicine delivery, and promote health equity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major challenges exist for including genomic information broadly into clinical risk assessment in diverse and multi-ethnic populations, and issues of bias in research databases, community engagement, and access to leading-edge digital technology disproportionately impact underserved populations. We will recruit 2,500 ethnically diverse and medically underserved NYC patients into a clinical trial to estimate individualized disease risk and investigate the impact of genomic risk communication to patients and their physicians, including trust and understanding of the information, uptake of recommended interventions, and psychosocial outcomes.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Correlations ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Peer Review ', ' Production ', ' Psychologist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' image processing ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' tool development ', ' data sharing ', ' operation ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' webinar ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Wait Time ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,486930
"Machine learning algorithms to analyze large medical image datasets Machine learning (ML) is poised to enable faster and more accurate interpretation of medical images by augmenting the capabilities of experts. The cost and difficulty of generating expert quality labelled image data is the primary limitation preventing faster progress and deployment in more domains. Success of ML techniques for medical image interpretation may reduce the burden on radiologists, reducing errors arising from fatigue or interruption, while simultaneously reducing costs and increasing speed and accuracy for patients. Our overall objective for this research is to dramatically reduce the burden of creating high quality reference labels by requiring only a small set of such labels from experts. We propose to address this problem by creating innovative algorithms that will construct reference quality labelled data with little input from domain experts, thus dramatically reducing the cost of labelling. This will enable us to apply ML techniques to generate high quality labels of the large amounts of unlabeled data that are already available, which in turn will facilitate the assessment of potential quantitative imaging biomarkers. We will develop, extend and evaluate novel algorithms that represent three distinct strategies for reducing labelling cost. These three strategies are learning from unlabelled data incorporating a novel strategy for characterizing uncertainty, optimizing sample selection for expert quality labelling with a novel form of Active Learning especially suited for deep learning, and reducing the cost of achieving quality labeling by replacing or augmenting an expert with a crowd of inexperts. We will then implement and distribute these novel algorithms, facilitating the replication of our experiments. Finally, we will demonstrate the practical efficacy of these three strategies by applying them to the important challenge of identifying quantitative imaging biomarkers that best capture alterations in brain structure that are associated with characteristics of ASD. These fundamental advances in informatics algorithms will reduce the cost and increase the rate of obtaining quality labels, which will in turn facilitate the widespread adoption and deployment of machine learning algorithms for image interpretation. Ultimately, this will stimulate the development of new imaging biomarkers that hold the potential to dramatically improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,10170765,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Learning ', ' Metals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Needles ', ' Noise ', ' North America ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Nonionizing Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Radiation ', ' Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Non-Ionizing Total ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Interventional Ultrasonography ', ' Interventional Ultrasound ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' image guided intervention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Network-based ', ' Geometry ', ' signal processing ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' metallicity ', ' imaging scientist ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' algorithm training ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,235027
"OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function Project summary Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' implantation ', ' brain research ', ' data format ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging platform ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' particle physics ', ' flavor physics ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Astronomy ', ' space science ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Physiology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' ']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,10091434,R01EB014955,"['Algorithms ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Grant ', ' Hybrids ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' prosthetic design ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' Ultrasonic Transducer ', ' Ultrasound transducer ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' processing speed ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' synergism ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' portability ', ' Documentation ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' real world application ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Computational Geometry ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Cloud Service ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Infrastructure ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' Virtual and Augmented reality ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2021,498914
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

The research proposal includes three aims: 1) investigate the oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides; 2) identify inhibitors for the formation of amyloid toxic oligomers from approved drugs and natural compounds; 3) study physical therapies for eliminating the toxic oligomers. The completion of these aims will reveal important insights of the amyloid oligomerization process, provide potential drugs and promising physical therapies for preventing the development of some diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease, which are both associated to the amyloid oligomerization. The proposed career development plan is built upon his previous training with four training goals to enhance his trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Experiential and didactic learning in experimental methods used for amyloid aggregation; 2) Acquire and apply advanced statistical analyses, machine learning as well as artificial intelligence; 3) Become an expert in force field and scientific program development; and 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to execute multicenter studies. Dr. Man and his primary mentor, Junmei Wang, Ph.D., have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide Dr. Viet through the proposed training and research activities. The proposed career development plan utilizes the intellectual, equipment and data resources available through the PittPharmacy and other schools/centers of the University of Pittsburgh. PittPharmacy is committed to supporting junior staff and faculty members through internal grants, administrative support and structured opportunities for networking and education. Dr. Man will obtain the high performant computer resources from the PittResearch “Center for Research Computing” (https://crc.pitt.edu/) and Dr. Wang’s group. He will also obtain the permission for accessing the data related to dementia diseases from Dr. Xie’s group and Dr. Lopez’s “Alzheimer's Disease Research Center”. Project Narrative The oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides majorly contributes to the development of some dementia diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which is associated to the oligomerization of amyloid-β peptides and tau protein.

"Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions Project Summary  Despite treatment advances over the past several decades, cancer-specific survival for oral cancers remains bleak, mostly due to the majority of cases being diagnosed at late stages. Early-stage detection of cancers (most often oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) would enable less disfiguring, less costly therapy with curative intent. However, limitations of traditional visual-tactile examination for oral cancerous and pre- cancerous lesions have hindered cancer detection and support for screening. Visual inspection for separation of benign from precancerous or cancerous lesions is inaccurate, and therefore standard practice entails referral and scalpel biopsy of most potentially malignant oral lesions. Furthermore, approximately 20% of potentially malignant oral lesions contain some degree of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma, and therefore early identification could allow curative treatment as the majority of OSCC typically starts as dysplasia, and the degree of dysplasia is correlated with the rate of malignant transformation. Detractors of oral screening cite the high prevalence of benign oral lesions and mild dysplasia as circumstances placing patients at risk of harms from over-testing and over-treatment. Thus, screening efforts could be transformed by adjunctive diagnostic tests that offer highly accurate cytopathologic information at the point of care, such as the NIDCR-supported Point-of-Care Oral Cytopathology Tool. Computer vision-assisted precision imaging tests have recently shown strong diagnostic performance for oral lesion characterization, but their potential pitfalls and promises must be thoroughly investigated before clinical application. Similarly, machine learning could bolster optical tests for visualizing potentially malignant lesions. If successful, these artificial intelligence devices could aid decision- making, preventing unnecessary scalpel biopsies for low-risk lesions and enabling risk-stratified surveillance or treatment. Our team of experts in computer disease simulation modeling, machine learning, oral medicine, and economic evaluation will transform a disease simulation model to provide analysis at the point of care, and evaluate the different potential uses of precision imaging diagnostics for translation to clinical care. We will expand our existing disease model of potentially malignant oral lesions to represent lesion characteristics and clinical risk categories (e.g. based on tobacco and alcohol use) through incorporation of large longitudinal datasets (Aim 1), in order to evaluate whether artificial intelligence-assisted cytologic testing can improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for low, moderate, or high risk categories (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate whether adjuncts for lesion visualization render favorable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening across risk categories, with or without artificial intelligence support, and develop a user interface for the model (Aim 3). This work will produce an analytic engine to guide clinical translation of artificial intelligence- aided diagnostics for oral lesion detection and characterization, to overcome insufficient screening reliability. Project Narrative Early stage oral cancers and precancers are currently under-detected, representing missed opportunity to improve the poor outcomes of oral cancer. While screening with conventional visual-tactile examination is limited in accuracy, artificial intelligence-assisted precision diagnostics could shift the cancer prevention paradigm toward screening for the broader population if enabling reliable triage of oral lesions for risk-based management. The proposed disease simulation model will evaluate the benefits and harms of harnessing these devices and precision treatment thresholds, guiding translation toward cancer control.",Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions,10298437,R01DE030169,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Oral Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oral Medicine ', ' Stomatology ', ' Oral Stage ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Caring ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Malignant -

"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Cost metrics ', ' cost measurement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Antismoking ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Abstinence ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' randomized effectiveness trial ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Dissemination and Implementation ', ' text messaging intervention ', ' text based intervention ', ' text intervention ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398
"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['Affect ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Intracranial Aneurysm ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' Secondary to ', ' Natural History ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' success ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Cerebral Aneurysm ', ' shear stress ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computer grid ', ' computational grid ', ' grid computing ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Computational Science ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Computational Geometry ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' personalized management ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966
"Establishment of Active Chromatin Domains RESEARCH SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms which drive coordinate gene activation will provide critical biological insights into development and disease. This supplement aims to enable AI/ML methods to integrate diverse datasets to help achieve that goal. Specifically, we plan to computationally model the spatiotemporal regulation of genes in Drosophila by combining ChIP-Seq, Hi-C/ Micro-C, and mRNA-Seq datasets. Moreover, we will obtaining and model single-cell measurements (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) across early embryonic developmental stages when domains of coordinate gene activation are established. Therefore, we propose three tasks to produce AI/ML-ready datasets for the community. (1) Development of robust preprocessing pipelines for easy access and input to graph-based neural networks for integrating datasets. (2) Application of sub-graph selection methods to extract informative interactions from large and noisy graphs generated from chromatin capture technologies. (3) Integrating single-cell measurements and providing these combinations for data modeling and analysis purposes. The proposed methods will assist the goals of accurately capturing the underlying biological information when using various machine learning approaches. Furthermore, we will provide processed datasets and scripts to the community to enable methodological innovations. Dr. Larschan will collaborate with machine learning expert Dr. Singh and we have collaborated on several projects based on the proposed topic with joint students and publications. This supplement will be essential to allowing us to continue collaborating and generating new methods and data sets which will provide key insight into coordinate gene activation.

"The Wilmer Institute Mentored Clinician Scientist Scholar Program-Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has revolutionized the field of medicine, especially in subspecialties with access to a large number of images, such as ophthalmology. While promising, the application of ML/AI in ophthalmology is limited by the lack of clear guidelines on how to extract ophthalmic data, convert these data into a form that is usable for ML/AI model training and ensure these data are adhering to the principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). Our proposal aims to address these limitations by delineating the best practices for data curation via an online lecture series that will be available free of charge to the public, once the curriculum is assessed and validated by another academic institution (Harvard/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary). If successful, the proposal will be impactful, as it will:  1. Accelerate reproducible research in ML/AI by enabling the creation of  standardized ML/AI-ready and FAIR datasets.  2. Disseminate the best practices in data curation beyond Johns Hopkins University  (JHU), as the online lectures will be made free of charge to the public.  3. Foster the creation of standardized multi-institutional datasets that will improve  both performance and generalizability of ML/AI algorithms in ophthalmology, by  enabling federated learning approaches and external validation of models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop an online lecture series, which educates clinician- scientists on making ophthalmic data ML/AI-ready and adherent to FAIR principles. We will focus on clinical and imaging databases that are frequently used in ophthalmology, including Epic, Zeiss FORUM, and Heidelberg HEYEX.

"Cancer Prevention and Control (CAPAC) Research Training Program Summary Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States and disproportionately affected by cancer health disparities. Despite this disparity, cancer datasets, specifically for Hispanic populations, are not as available as for other ethnicities. Given the need for cancer health disparities research with a focus on Hispanic health, there is a need for applying Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches in this field, and an urgency on making Hispanics cancer datasets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) and AI/ML -ready. The Cancer Prevention and Control Research (CAPAC) Training Program of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC), recruits graduate and health professions students for a hands-on summer research experience in PR. This supplement aims to expand the scope of the parent CAPAC training Program and prepare research workforce on 1) the techniques and approaches to manipulate and pre-process Hispanics cancer datasets to make them FAIR and AI/ML ready, and on 2) the available methods for developing ML-based models to analyze these data and create predictive models for cancer diagnosis and treatments with a focus on Hispanic datasets. We will develop an online course based on the data science project lifecycle, which includes four phases: 1) Data Understanding/ Data Pre-processing; 2) Data Wrangling; 3) Model Planning; and 4) Model Building. This 24-hour online asynchronous course will be organized in modules within two components. Component 1 will include the following topics: fundamentals of cancer data types, identifying and understanding cancer datasets, data science concepts and project lifecycles; basic programming concepts; programming with Python; exploring, pre-processing, and conditioning the cancer datasets; performing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) prior to AI/ML modelling. Component 2 will add topics such as: principles of AI/ML; variable correlations and associations; determining datasets for training and testing; supervised and unsupervised ML approaches; classification, regression and ensembles ML-algorithms; familiarizing with ML tools. To develop our course, examples and projects, we will use Hispanics cancer datasets from the US and PR. The course would be voluntary and free for interested participants (capacity of 40 trainees), including CAPAC participants (alumni) and applicants, CAPAC mentors, as well as trainees and research staff from collaborating grants/institutions. Student’s gained skills will be evaluated with quizzes and a final practical project, while the course will be evaluated with the support of the evaluation component of the parent grant. This supplement will impact the development of human resources (e.g. students, researchers, clinicians) from the United States and Puerto Rico with the competencies and skills needed to make FAIR Hispanics cancer datasets and to apply AI/ML approaches for creating ML-based predictive models for cancer.

"Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY This Idaho INBRE Administrative Supplement will establish a collaboration between an INBRE-Developmental Research Program Investigator, S Long, and an IDeA co-funded R01 principle investigator, D Mitchell. Dr. Long is a computer scientist with expertise in machine learning and computer-assisted image analyses. Dr. Mitchell is a cell biologist/immunologist with expertise in retinal development/regeneration. The project is titled, ‘Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration’. There are three Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1. Develop a collaboration between the two investigators to enhance both projects and  increase undergraduate student research opportunities.  Specific Aim 2: Determine the requirement for selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal  development and regeneration.  Specific Aim 3: Develop an image analysis pipeline to support zebrafish retinal analyses. Microglia are the resident phagocytes in the central nervous system and engulf and degrade pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris. In addition, these cells may be involved in retinal degenerative disease, injury, homeostasis, development, regeneration, and/or crosstalk with Müller glia. The Mitchell laboratory did transcriptome analysis of microglia/macrophage populations isolated from regenerating zebrafish retinas. From this, a shortlist of five microglia-expressed genes of interest are identified. Zebrafish mutant lines are, or will be, established for each gene. Real-time live confocal imaging will be done on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous zebrafish lines to record microglial dynamics in developing or regenerating retinas. The Long laboratory will develop an image analysis pipeline to automate the interpretation of the large datasets from these experiments. The analyses will quantify microglia numbers and morphology, cell death, Müller glial proliferation, hypertrophy, migration of daughter cells, and expression of neural progenitor markers. The machine learning techniques developed by the Long laboratory will relieve the bottleneck and potential biases in analysis of large image datasets from the Mitchell laboratory and allow rapid testing of microglia gene function. Strong preliminary data and investigator expertise indicate that this team will complete the proposed work. The Long-Mitchell collaboration will provide a continuum of research opportunities for students by delivering broadened student research experiences. Dr. Long has the expertise and the environment to propel students into Data Science, a needed complement for modern biological research. Undergraduate students will be supported in both the Long laboratory at the primarily undergraduate institution, Lewis-Clark State College, and the Mitchell laboratory at the research-intensive, University of Idaho. PROJECT NARRATIVE This collaboration expands two projects currently supported by INBRE and an IDeA co-funded R01, into an interdisciplinary effort to probe specific microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration using computer-assisted image analyses. The investigators bring expertise in molecular biology and computer science, respectively.

"Enriching SARS-CoV-2 sequence data in public repositories with information extracted from full text articles Project Summary In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have published over one hundred thousand research articles and made available over eight hundred thousand virus genome sequences. These sequences, along with their metadata, can be used to understand virus evolution and spread and their implications for public health, a field of study called genomic epidemiology. However, these sequence records do not typically contain patient metadata such as demographics, clinical severity, or comorbidities, preventing researchers from uncovering trends in population health. To understand the severity of the problem, we analyzed nearly 748 thousand SARS-CoV-2 records from GISAID and 60 thousand from GenBank for the presence of patient metadata finding age and gender were represented in < 1% of GenBank records and in GISAID, 26% included sex, and 24% had age. For other fields, the amount of missing data is even more pronounced, with neither resource providing information on a patient's race and only GISAID specifying severity (i.e. ICU) in less than 5% of records. To address missing virus metadata, researchers could utilize the publication associated with the new sequences, however, the virus sequence record is often never updated with a link to the publication. From the set of records that we analyzed, 3.4% (of 748K) in GISAID and < 1% (of 117K) in GenBank had a link to a publication. This greatly hinders secondary data analysis of these sequences and limits the ability to use them at scale to uncover associations between the viral genome, transmission risk, and health outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to enhance genomic epidemiology and population health of COVID-19 with a framework to continuously and automatically enrich SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequence metadata in public databases such as GenBank and GISAID with metadata in associated published articles. We will incorporate input from clinicians at the front-line of patient care during the pandemic and build on our NIH funded work (R01AI117011), which used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enrich the geographic metadata of a sequence record using its corresponding published article. We have used these data in virus phylogeographic models and shown the benefit of using enriched metadata for modeling virus evolution and spread. Theavailability of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, paired withfull- text COVID-19 articles and preprints, presents an opportunity for metadata enrichment and scientific discovery beyond our prior work. Our specific aims are to: (1) enrich SARS-CoV-2 sequence metadata using text extracted from publications and (2) derive key epidemiologic insights for different patient demographics using our enriched SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset. We will leverage our prior joint work funded by the NIH to enable the secondary use of enriched metadata for genomic epidemiology to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and spread among different population groups. We will disseminate the enriched data through our GeoBoost2 data dashboard, GenBank LinkOut and the i2b2 platform. The latter will more immediately allow integration with COVID-specific clinical data shared by the 4CE Consortium.

"Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation Project Summary Biological knowledgebases are a critical resource for researchers and accelerate scientific discoveries by providing manually curated, machine-readable data collections. However, the aggregation and manual curation of biological data is a labor-intensive process that relies almost entirely on professional biocurators. Two approaches have been advanced to help with this problem: natural language processing (NLP; text mining (TM) and machine learning (ML)) and engagement of researchers (community curation). However, neither of these approaches alone is sufficient to address the critical need for increased efficiency in the biocuration process. Our solution to these challenges is an NLP-enhanced community curation portal, Author Curation to Knowledgebase (ACKnowledge). The ACKnowledge system, currently implemented for the C. elegans literature, couples statistical methods and text mining algorithms to enhance community curation of research articles. We propose to strengthen and expand ACKnowledge by including other species into our pipeline, incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models, and presenting sentence-level entity and concept extraction for more detailed author curation. In addition, we will develop an Author Curation Portal (ACP) to allow authors to easily upload and curate their own documents. Taken together, these enhancements will allow us to maximize community curation efforts by leveraging author expertise in multiple areas of biology, while at the same time supporting authors with as much AI-assisted curation as possible. This reciprocal interaction will improve not only the content of knowledgebases, but the AI methods themselves, as we will receive valuable feedback on our models. By developing an Author Curation Portal, we will further empower authors to participate in the curation process and alert knowledgebases to key information that can, and should, be readily discoverable in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Project Narrative The pace at which biological knowledge is published in the scientific literature far surpasses the ability of professional biocurators to collate and annotate such knowledge in a timely fashion. However, knowledgebases are a critical component of biological research whose utility depends on prompt entry of new data. Combining the dual benefits of text mining and community curation, the proposed ACKnowledge system, readily generalized, presents a novel approach to aiding curation by guiding authors to efficiently and accurately annotate their papers, thus quickly and reliably adding new information to knowledgebases.",Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation,10344771,R01LM013871,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Paper ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' learning engagement ', ' dashboard ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' WormBase ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genome resource ', ' ']",NLM,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,355938
"The Biennial VA NCRAR Scientific Conference Series Project Summary/Abstract  The NCRAR will hold its next three Biennial Conferences starting with “Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure” in fall 2021. Subsequent conference topics are tentatively titled “Post-Pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology” and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”, to be refined based on developments in the field and participant feedback from the previous conference. These three-day intensive conferences will bring together basic and translational scientists, clinicians, patients, and health policymakers to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients with hearing and balance disorders. We hypothesize that clinical outcomes will be improved if they incorporate a collaborative, interprofessional clinical approach shaped by both the pathophysiology and the perspective of the patient. Consistent with the NIDCD's 2017-2021 Strategic Plan, these conferences aim to meet the critical need for multidisciplinary approaches to diagnose and treat auditory and vestibular deficits appropriately within a patient-centered care model.  The objectives of the 2021 conference are to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms, diagnosis, and clinical management of vestibular dysfunction. Specific topics include cellular regeneration, aging, head trauma, psychophysical testing, artificial-intelligence guided diagnosis, virtual reality-based rehabilitation, and vestibular implantation. Panel discussions with patients and experts and curated matching of mentors with students provide valuable communication and networking opportunities. A novel aspect of the conference series is the inclusion of stakeholders, such as patients and policymakers, within the clinical teaching sessions. An innovative aspect is to optimize the relevance of the case-study focused problem-based learning sessions by polling attendees regarding their challenges in clinical research and patient care. A closing discussion with the presenters and audience will recap recommendations for future research and developments in clinical care.  The conference will be limited to 200 attendees to create an intimate environment enhancing open communication. Ten scholarships provided to students and 5 to practicing clinicians will attract participants from outside the scientific community, with at least 8 scholarships awarded to applicants who are women, part of a racial/ethnic minority group, or have a disability. The conference will be publicized through social media, email and other professional meetings. Announcements will be posted on the NCRAR website, professional organization websites, and published in specialty journals. Conference content will be disseminated to non- attendees via a special issue of the American Journal of Audiology, and the conference presentations will be available at a reduced price on the NCRAR website (with presenter permissions). The purpose of this grant is to supplement the funding of three conferences (“Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to Cure”, “Post-pandemic Innovations in Connected Audiology”, and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”) to be hosted by the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research between 2021 and 2025. The aim of these conferences is to improve auditory research and clinical practice by sharing the knowledge and perspectives of patients, clinicians, scientists and health policy stakeholders to alleviate the burden of auditory and vestibular deficits on function and quality of life. This conference is unique in its multidisciplinary, multiple stake holder approach to providing specialized training in clinical innovations, identification of the critical gaps in research, and appreciation of the health system barriers to advances in the field.",The Biennial VA NCRAR Scientific Conference Series,10318494,R13DC019837,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI

"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan.

"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone. The prediction tools will be applied through collaborations with experimental scientists and disseminated to the community.",Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction,10251061,R01GM093123,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Genome ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Renaissance ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' monomer ', ' Performance ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Homo ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Region ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' self assembly ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' C-terminal ', ' comparative ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' long short term memory ', ' protein data bank ', ' protein databank ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,342174
"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT.

"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia.

"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses.

The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX, http://mcx.space) light transport simulation platform developed by our team has become one of the most widely disseminated biophotonics modeling platforms, known for its high accuracy, high speed and versatility, as attested to by its over 27,000 downloads and nearly 1,000 citations from a large (2,400+ registered users) world-wide user community. Over the past years, we have also been pushing the boundaries in cutting-edge Monte Carlo (MC) photon simulation algorithms by exploring modern GPU architectures, advanced anatomical modeling methods and systematic software optimizations. In this proposed project, we will build upon the strong momentum created in the initial funding period, and strive to further advance the state-of-the-art of GPU-accelerated MC light transport modeling with strong support from the world’s leading GPU manufacturers and experts, further expanding our platform to address a number of emerging challenges in biomedical optics applications. Specifically, we will further explore emerging GPU architecture and resources, such as ray- tracing cores, half- and mixed-precision hardware, and portable programming models, to further accelerate the MC modeling speed. We will also develop hybrid shape/mesh-based MC algorithms to dramatically advance the capability in simulating extremely complex yet realistic anatomical structures, such as porous tissues in the lung, dense vessel networks in the brain, and multi-scaled tissue domains. In parallel, we aim to make a break- through in applying deep-learning-based image denoising techniques to equivalently accelerate MC simulations by 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes, as suggested in our preliminary studies. In the continuation of this project, we strive to create a dynamic and community-engaging simulation environment by extending our software to allow users to create, share, browse, and reuse pre-configured simulations, avoiding redundant works in re-creating complex simulations and facilitating reproducible research. In addition, we will expand our well-received user training programs and widely disseminate our open-source tools via major Linux distributions and container images. At the end of this continued funding period, we will provide the community with a significantly accelerated, widely-available and well-supported biophotonics modeling platform that can handle multi-scaled tissue optical modeling ranging from microscopic to macroscopic domains. Project Narrative The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) light transport modeling platform has quadrupled its user community and paper citation numbers during the initial funding period. Building upon this strong momentum, we aim to further explore computational acceleration enabled by emerging GPU architectures and resources, and spearhead novel Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to address the emerging needs of a broad biophotonics research community. We also dedicate our efforts to the further dissemination, training and usability enhancement of our software, and provide timely support to our large (>2,400 registered users) and active (>300 mailing list subscribers) user community.",Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform,10228757,R01GM114365,"['Acceleration ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Industry ', ' instrumentation ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Paper ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Microscopic ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' portability ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Future Generations ', ' Address ', ' Biophotonics ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Linux ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' usability ', ' complex biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' simulation environment ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,349146
"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10203815,R01MH120648,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Colombia ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pan American Health Organization ', ' PAHO ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Administrator ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' common treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' screening ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' trial design ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' Latin American ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' implementation intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2021,606962
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment Abstract Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability. Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss. An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning (RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’ response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults, provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration, and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources. Project Narrative The obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems, and existing gold standard behavioral weight loss treatments are highly expensive to implement due to their intensive, long-term nature and the highly trained clinicians required to deliver treatment. Approaches to decreasing costs (e.g., low intensity treatments, coaching by paraprofessionals rather than experts) have been implemented with moderate success, but weight losses are not consistent across different cost-saving approaches, suggesting that individuals may be best served when they are matched to the type of treatment they need, and when the resources matched to individuals are continuously adapted as their needs change. The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that continuously adjusts features of weight loss coaching including modality and coach skill level.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment,10210830,R01DK125641,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Insurance ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Accountability ', ' Gender ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' compulsive eating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' Binge Eating ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' American ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' treatment responders ', ' therapy responders ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' improved outcome ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' recruit ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' overweight adults ', ' over-weight adults ', ' remote delivery ', ' delivered remotely ', ' cost effective treatment ', ' cost effective therapy ', ' ']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,634165
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities.

"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,10217209,R01GM137083,"['Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' Saints ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Early identification ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical decision support ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,402815
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10269008,R01DA040487,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Decentralization ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nicotine ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Bias ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Agreement ', ' substances of abuse ', ' Substance of Abuse ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Cannabis ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' structural genomics ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Source Code ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' distributed data ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' data sharing ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' life-long learning ', ' lifelong learning ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Data Pooling ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617911
"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging

"Clinical and Translational Science Award Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE Overall: Summary Lead: Reza Shaker MD 5 year direct: NIH/NCATS: $16,140,360 Institution: $34,670,756 Total: $50,811,116 In CTSA 3.0, we will continue our relentless pursuit to transform clinical and translational research in southeastern Wisconsin and the science of clinical and translational (CT) research. We remain focused on and committed to expansion of an engaged, knowledgeable, and high performing CT workforce, refinement of proficient and innovative infrastructure to support CT research and science and removing all impediments to the performance of research. Our long-standing mission to foster a borderless, collaborative, and synergistic research and research training environment for our multi-institutional translational workforce, our community stakeholders and health system members to advance the clinical/translational science research and improve the health of our community, our nation, and beyond continues to drive our direction. We remain committed to working within the CTSA consortium to learn from our colleagues across the nation and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the CT field. The tri-lateral mutually learning ecosystem formed by our workforce, the community, and the health system shapes the framework for strategically moving forward and has led to the concept developed in this application of integrated clinical and research ensembles (ICREs) in which patients, clinical investigators, translational researchers, health system representatives, community members, population ambassadors, basic scientists, clinicians and others are brought together. We will further expand our outreach into the communities we serve, reaching deeper into underserved communities, and will incorporate CT research across the life span to pediatric, geriatric and underrepresented populations. In the end, our goal is to use our hard-earned experience and extended capabilities to address the unmet health needs of our patients and our community while persevering to advance our infrastructure and workforce development programs to meet the standards of the developing field of translational science and research. Page 166 Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE  Project Narrative Our community is in need of better preventive measures, more accurate diagnostics and more effective and efficient therapies. We offer a novel and comprehensive mechanism to address this need through research and education. We propose to create a mutually learning ecosystem that coalesce a myriad of requisite stakeholders including health systems, research enterprises and the community in southeast Wisconsin to work in tandem towards solutions that improve the health outcomes of our citizens.

"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Noise ', ' Oral Characters ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tongue ', ' Translating ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' Custom ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Microscopic ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' Epithelial ', ' Squamous Cell ', ' soft tissue ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Contralateral ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' interest ', ' electrical property ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' bioelectricity ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' oral tissue ', ' cost ', ' imaging probe ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' imaging properties ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' electrical impedance tomography ', ' pressure sensor ', ' ']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Budgets ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Operating System ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' reduced substance use ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' healthy weight ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' SMART health ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490
"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Codon Nucleotides ', ' Codon ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Half-Life ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein structure function ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein expression ', ' mRNA Degradation ', ' mRNA Transcript Degradation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' ubiquitin ligase ', ' Ubiquitin Ligase Component Gene ', ' Ubiquitin Ligase Gene ', ' Coupling ', ' biophysical model ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246

While not required for the current definition, intense trachomatous inflammation (TI) correlates better with presence of the causative agent, Chlamydia trachomatis. Grading of both TF and TI vary widely between individuals, and even in the same individual over time. As cases become rarer, training new graders becomes more difficult. As areas become controlled, trachoma budgets are being cut, and the institutional knowledge of grading lost, making detection of remaining cases and potential resurgence difficult. One of the greatest obstacles to reaching our trachoma goals is an inadequate diagnostic test. The WHO relies on field grading of TF; human inconsistency, grader bias, and training costs are becoming major obstacles, but they do not need to be. We propose to test the central hypothesis that a fully automatic, deep learning grader can perform as well as trained physicians in detecting and grading trachoma. The hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific aims: 1) Automatic identification of follicles and grading of TF and 2) Automatic tarsal blood vessels detection and grading of TI. Our approach includes the development, training and testing of novel image processing pipelines based on semantic segmentation and disease classification using deep learning neural networks and state-of-the-art object detection. All of the data to be used in this study is secondary data from NEI-funded and other trachoma clinical trials conducted by our study team. We aim to facilitate widespread adoption of these novel tools across the trachoma research and grading community, by open source availability of generated code and interoperability of generated machine learning models across programming languages through use of the open neural networks exchange format. Our proposed research addresses the problem of subjectivity, cost and reliability of human trachoma grading. Successful completion of the proposed specific aims will also be a key step forward towards future study and development of providing health organizations and research teams with a novel, efficient and extensible tool to ensure objective, automated, scalable trachoma grading in the field to enhance, or in some cases replace, traditional field grading during the critical endgame of trachoma control, as well surveillance for potential resurgence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Trachoma elimination and control are major WHO goals, but success is limited by the ability to accurately identify and grade trachoma cases in the field manually by human graders, a process expensive, subjective and slow to scale up. This project seeks to perform secondary analysis by leveraging existing trachoma photograph datasets from numerous NEI-funded and other-sponsored prior randomized controlled trachoma studies in order to further develop a novel deep learning computational tool able to automatically detect and grade the active forms of trachoma in digital photographs. By employing deep learning neural networks and advanced image analysis, we propose to create a computer program with the ability to classify and grade trachoma in a way that is automatic, objective, scalable and with subsequent potential for remote grading which is auditable by regulatory agencies.",TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS,10196816,R21EY032567,"['Adoption ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' conjunctiva ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Eyelid structure ', ' Eyelids ', ' Palpebra ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Judgment ', ' Manuals ', ' Photography ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' health organization ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' secondary analysis ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250
"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",10075940,R01HG009906,"['Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Intuition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' high throughput technology ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' chromatin modifier ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Genome engineering ', ' Coupled ', ' mammalian genome ', ' prototype ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' genome annotation ', ' epigenome ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' genome browser ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' random forest ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,395000
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Biology ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' sensor ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Data Files ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Security ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' Consumption ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' biological systems ', ' complex biological systems ', ' data sharing ', ' simulation software ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' community building ', ' data access ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' metadata standards ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,10176589,R01LM010090,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Thyme ', ' Thymus vulgaris ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' cohesion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' Knowledge Extraction ', ' next generation ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' open source ', ' electronic structure ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' learning community ', ' social media ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' Apache ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,531398

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods.

"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients.

"Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Career Development K12 Program PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall objective of the NEI Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program Award at UCSD is to develop outstanding clinician scientists to successfully compete for NIH grants and emerge as leaders within academic ophthalmology. Through this institutional career development award, we will continue to mentor clinician scientists toward independent academic appointments in ophthalmology. Since 1991, the UC San Diego Shiley Eye Institute has excelled in mentoring the career development of clinician scientists throughout ophthalmology. Many of these individuals now have successful research and clinical careers around the world; they include Department Chairs, Division Chiefs, and impactful academicians. With continued funding, we will amplify these strengths through a structured program of mentoring, research, and education to identify and mentor the next generation of academic clinician scientists, across all subspecialty areas of ophthalmology. With an emphasis on recruiting strong applications from women and minority applicants, Scholars will be selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in ophthalmology. The Scholar will undertake these activities in the area of basic and/or clinical sciences appropriate to their scientific focus, and by partnering with mentor(s) to facilitate career development. Each Scholar will be trained in clinically relevant research, statistics, scientific writing, grant preparation, ethics, leadership, and the responsible conduct of research. Additional aspects of the curriculum of each Scholar will be individualized by the Program Director (PI), Research Directors, Education Director, Executive Committee, Mentoring Group, and lead mentor based upon the Scholar's selected primary research track and his/her skills, background, and career goals. Each Scholar will create an original research program and through this Award develop an independent academic career. We propose six primary research tracks: (1) Visual Neuroscience, (2) Genomics and Proteomics, (3) Bioengineering, (4) Stem Cell Biology, (5) Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, and (6) Clinical (human subjects) Research. In the first K12 funding period, we trained and recruited four clinician scientists in the subspecialty areas of retina (2), glaucoma (1), and pediatric ophthalmology (1). Two of these Scholars already have received NIH K08 awards, and the other two have submitted K08 proposals that are under consideration.

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic.  As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to fight against the disease.  This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via a HIPAA compliant secure server to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a secure HIPAA compliant database that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10190370,R01AI127203,"['Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Businesses ', ' Natural History ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Techniques ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' fight against ', ' systems research ', ' patient privacy ', ' Confidentiality of Patient Information ', ' patient confidentiality ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combat ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Secure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' Data Discovery ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' data warehouse ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' CoV emergence ', ' corona virus emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent corona virus ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging corona virus ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new corona virus ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel corona virus ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data infrastructure ', ' big-data science ', ' COVID-19 treatment ', ' COVID-19 therapy ', ' COVID19 therapy ', ' COVID19 treatment ', ' SARS-CoV-2 therapy ', ' SARS-CoV-2 treatment ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 therapy ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 treatment ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapy ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 treatment ', ' treat COVID-19 ', ' treat COVID19 ', ' treat SARS-CoV-2 ', ' treat coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' COVID-19 surveillance ', ' COVID19 surveillance ', ' SARS-CoV-2 surveillance ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 surveillance ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 surveillance ', ' COVID-19 patient ', ' COVID infected patient ', ' COVID patient ', ' COVID positive patient ', ' COVID-19 infected patient ', ' COVID-19 positive patient ', ' COVID19 patient ', ' COVID19 positive patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infected patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease patient ', ' coronavirus disease positive patient ', ' coronavirus patient ', ' patient infected with COVID ', ' patient infected with COVID-19 ', ' patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' patient with COVID ', ' patient with COVID-19 ', ' patient with COVID19 ', ' patient with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient with coronavirus disease ', ' patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patient ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,626275
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"The Monarch Initiative: Linking diseases to model organism resources ABSTRACT Biomedical researchers need to identify novel disease genes and understand disease mechanisms; clinicians need to diagnose diseases and optimize treatments. An improved understanding of the genetic basis of disease helps achieve both goals. The Monarch Initiative makes this possible by integrating the fragmented data landscape into the most comprehensive open collection of genotype-phenotype data in the world. Our Knowledge Graph (KG) links together clinical, biomedical, and basic science research data spanning multiple organisms, and supports reasoning across a wide range of organisms, body systems, and diseases. Monarch has achieved demonstrable clinical and translational success using model organism data to perform rare disease diagnosis and gene-to-disease discovery, and our resources have become global standards. In Phase II, we integrated the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) into the UMLS; enhanced our variant prioritization algorithms and Exomiser tool, which was applied to 30,000 patients in the National Health Service (UK); developed the Biolink Model/API; released new ontologies (Mondo unified disease ontology, Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno), and the Environmental Conditions and Treatments Ontology (ECTO)), raised the number of harmonized data sources in our KG to 34; and overhauled our web Portal. We will leverage this foundation to make Monarch more intuitive for a diversity of users and contexts in phase III as follows: Augment the Monarch Portal with new visualizations and tools. Guided by user requirements, iterative user testing, and feedback, we propose to enhance the user experience and Portal functionality, focusing our work on improvements to Navigation, Visualization, and Query. Evaluate, optimize, and enhance algorithms for disease diagnostics, cross-species inference, and gene-disease discovery. We will develop a comprehensive, modular evaluation framework, ‘PhEval,’ that will allow us to monitor the diagnostic yield and performance of cross-species inference as our ontologies and data graphs evolve. This will assist basic science researchers and clinicians to reveal cross-species mechanistic evidence and evaluate potential precision disease modeling strategies. Disseminate computational tools, data, services, and tutorials to a broad translational community. We will expand access to our KG to enable users to process the KG for different domains and use cases, through simplified downloads, APIs, software libraries, R packages, Jupyter notebooks, and Dockerized resources, along with training materials. This will better support bioinformaticians and other researchers in leveraging our KG and phenotype data in their analyses. The Monarch Initiative aims to significantly improve the utilization, accessibility, and value of animal models for disease diagnosis and discovery.

"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage

"Brain-Computer Interface in dynamic tasks with deep learning and functional connectivity analysis Abstract The PI proposes a high-impact multi-disciplinary research project to develop and validate machine learning al- gorithms for shift-detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with applications to brain-computer interface to make them more reliable. Brain-computer interface is a means of communication for severely disabled peo- ple by decoding brain responses and translating their detection into commands with applications such a virtual keyboard or robotic control systems. Current brain-computer interface systems cannot be efﬁciently deployed in clinical setting due to their inability to properly take into account the non-stationarity properties of the evoked brain responses in the electroencephalogram signal. This project aims at enhancing the brain decoding perfor- mance when the task changes over time. The PI proposes to investigate the effects of well deﬁned types of data shifts: covariate shift, probability shift, and concept shift to enhance brain decoding performance in changing tasks. The goals of this proposal are: 1) to characterize in event related potential (ERP) components neural signatures corresponding to task changes by using EEG recordings and machine learning techniques for single- trial detection. 2) to research in functional brain connectivity neural signature corresponding to task changes by using EEG recordings and directed model-based and model free techniques of functional brain connectivity. 3) to combine and adapt machine learning techniques to detect when changes occur during a task. This proposal will signiﬁcantly improve the infrastructure of research and education at California State University Fresno, Hispanic- Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Paciﬁc Islander-Serving Institution, introducing biomedical engineering research experiences to underrepresented minority and female students in computer science and psychology students. This would allow them to experience different stages of the scientiﬁc method, and acquire fundamental skills related to data science applied to physiological signals with potential impact on society for improving the life of severely disabled people. Public Health Relevance Statement Brain-computer interfaces may eventually be used routinely to replace or restore useful functions for people severely disabled by neuro-muscular disorders, and to improve rehabilitation strategies for people with strokes, head trauma, and other neurological disorders. In order to deploy the brain-computer interface technology in clinical setting, it is necessary to optimize their reliability by better understanding the type of changes in the brain evoked responses that may happen over time. This project will provide new tools and knowledge about the non-stationarity properties of the electroencephalography signal when people do visual target detection tasks, for improving the reliability and performance of brain-computer interfaces.",Brain-Computer Interface in dynamic tasks with deep learning and functional connectivity analysis,10292336,R15NS118581,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Craniocerebral Trauma ', ' Craniocerebral Injuries ', ' Head Injuries ', ' Head Trauma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Probability ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Mental concentration ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Visual ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' virtual ', ' brain computer interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' visual information ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' signal processing ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Data Science ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NINDS,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO,R15,2021,396731
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network Contact PD/PI: BARACK, DAVID L The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: BARACK, DAVID L Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.

"Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases Parent grant Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases. Hundreds of genomics studies have exposed major gaps in our understanding of the mechanistic relationships between genomic variation, cellular processes, tissue function, and trait variation. The goal of the parent project is to develop a suite of computational frameworks that integrate massive collections of genomic and biomedical data to make the following three advances: Direction 1: Discern and leverage mechanism-based subtypes of complex traits and diseases. Direction 2: Characterize physiology and disease along the human lifespan and across the sexes. Direction 3: Find analogous contexts in model organisms for studying human traits/diseases. As demonstrated by us and others, genome-wide molecular networks are grand unifiers of molecular data and knowledge, and serve as powerful tools to contextually understand the roles genes play in cellular pathways, tissue physiology, phenotype/disease mechanisms, and drug action. Hence, a central aspect of our parent project is to develop multiple machine learning approaches to leverage molecular networks to generate accurate, testable hypotheses about the roles genes play in defining subtypes, age/sex differences, and cross-species analogs of a range of complex disorders.  As part of this work, we have developed GenePlexus github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus, an open source software to run and benchmark our state-of-the-art approach for combining genome-scale networks with supervised machine learning (ML) to get accurate novel predictions about various gene attributes (e.g., pathway membership or disease association; Liu*, Mancuso*, et al., 2020 Bioinformatics). Similarly, our group has committed efforts to make all our other computational methods available to the broader biomedical research community in the form of software tools for open science. We have released such software with nearly all our papers. Other recent examples include: ● PecanPy github.com/krishnanlab/PecanPy for parallelized, efficient, and accelerated node2vec. ● Expresto github.com/krishnanlab/Expresto for imputing unmeasured genes in transcriptomes. ● Txt2Onto github.com/krishnanlab/Txt2Onto for annotating –omics samples based on free-text metadata. Goal of the supplement project and current prototype GenePlexus: A cloud platform for network-based machine learning The goal of the proposed supplement is to take our software development to the next level by a building a new cloud-based GenePlexus platform to enable: i) biomedical/experimental researchers to seamlessly take advantage of network-based ML to generate interpretable genome-wide predictions, and ii) computational researchers to run network-based ML, retrieve results, and integrate with existing data analysis workflows. The project team, which includes the PI, a postdoc trained in cloud computing, and two professional software engineers – has worked together over the past six months to develop a prototype of the GenePlexus platform (in the form of a web-server mounted on Microsoft Azure; Fig. 1). Figure 1: Screenshots of the current prototype of the GenePlexus webserver that implements our original GenePlexus software github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus. When a user uploads a geneset, GenePlexus creates a virtual machine that trains a ML model, leveraging pre-saved data. In addition to predicting genes in the network functionally similar to the user-supplied genes, GenePlexus provides enables the user to interpret the custom-built ML model in terms of its similarity to thousands of models that were trained to predict genes associated with biological processes (from Gene Ontology) and diseases (from DisGeNET). In addition to retrieving the prediction results in multiple convenient formats, users can visualize the top predicted genes as a network graph. Narrative We are proposing to bring together two powerful approaches in biomedical data science – genome-scale network analysis and supervised machine learning (ML) – in the form of a cloud platform called GenePlexus. This platform will enable both biologists and bioinformaticians to easily perform network-based ML on massive genome-scale molecular networks and get novel interpretable predictions about gene attributes of interest.

"The development and validation of a novel tool for the assessment of bulbar dysfunction in ALS Project Summary  The overall aim of our “parent” grant proposal is to develop and validate a clinician-administered bulbar dysfunction assessment tool for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), called ALS-Index of Bulbar Dysfunction (ALS-IBD). Interrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, clinical practices as well as clinical research have been forced to pivot, simultaneously providing an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new and expansion of existing remote assessment platforms, which can serve clinical and research assessment needs. As part of this pivoting effort, we recently created VirtualSLP, a software tool to support remote, online multi- modal - high quality video/kinematic and audio/acoustic – data collection, using a multi-platform compatible, web-browser based audio and video recordings. In parallel, we have designed a tool for automatic extraction of kinematic and acoustic metrics of neurological diseases, which provides clinically interpretable features/ measures that have been identified as important for detecting and tracking the onset and progression of oro- motor and speech (aka bulbar) impairments in neurological diseases. The next step in the progression of our technology development efforts is to incorporate the automatic metrics extraction software within VirtualSLP, creating a user-friendly and intuitive cloud-based platform for research and clinical assessment of bulbar dysfunction. To achieve rapid development and deployment of VirtualSLP, we will use modern engineering methodology and user-centered design to iterate through a number of steps in the software development cycle. The cycle will begin with the engagement of end users (e.g., researchers, clinicians and patients) in design sessions to document users' current and anticipated end-to-end experiences with the software, while performing the baseline analysis of the existing software components and determining and implementing necessary changes. The necessary components will be incorporated to create VirtualSLP on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, to enhance its usability, interoperability, scalability, and security, as part of the NIH STRIDES initiative. Usability testing of Virtual SLP with end users will be performed throughout the development process and at the end of the development cycle. When completed, the work will result in an enhanced software tool for collection of audio and video data and corresponding AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician- administered tool for bulbar ALS assessment and monitoring (ALS-IBD-Remote) by providing a novel cloud- based platform for its clinical validation. This work aims to exemplify the intent of the current funding opportunity by supporting collaborations between clinical speech scientists, data scientists, and software engineers to enhance the design, implementation, and ""cloud-readiness"" of research software. Project Narrative  The current proposal focuses on the development of VirtualSLP, a software tool for video and audio data collection and automatic AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician-administered tool for the assessment and monitoring of bulbar ALS, as well as other neurological diseases, by providing a novel cloud-based platform for validation of remote assessment. The development of VirtualSLP will follow the best practices of software engineering using the enterprise architecture framework and agile methodology, with focus on inclusive, user-centered

"Deep learning for oral premalignancy evaluation PROJECT ABSTRACT: The overall objective of this proposal is the development and validation of rapid, deep learning-based digital pathology biomarkers for predicting risk and biological evolution of premalignant lesions progression to invasive oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). To accomplish this task, we have assembled a team of clinical experts in oral premalignancy biology and patient care, and will deploy a cutting-edge computational pipeline to create computational models using a massive data set of more than 4000 samples. This project seeks to meet a critical unmet need in characterizing and risk stratifying the precursor lesions for OCSCC. Premalignant oral dysplasias transform to OCSCC at an overall 15% rate. Unfortunately, no unified grading schema exists to reflect the risk of progression from premalignancy to OCSCC, and interrater agreement between pathologists is low. The ability to prioritize the aggressiveness of dysplasias would be of significant benefit for guiding oral premalignancy management, as patients with OCSCC suffer from 55% five-year survival, high post-treatment relapse rate, and morbid diagnostic and treatment options. The current histopathology standard for premalignancy risk is hematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide evaluation by an expert pathologist. With a prevalence approaching 10%, the high frequency of oral premalignant lesions makes HE data abundant, and this large amount of data is an ideal use application for artificial intelligence methods. Deep Learning is an emerging discipline within artificial intelligence where digital image information can be automatically processed in order to recognize patterns in digital histology images and accomplish classification tasks. Deep learning is the focus of our lab, and we have both published and preliminary data relevant to premalignancy progression prediction. The central hypotheses of this proposal is that tissue patterns within oral premalignancy digital pathology samples can be automatically risk-stratified using deep learning, and contain important hidden information, and contain important hidden information about individual prognosis. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, this proposal seeks to train, validate, and interrogate a series of deep learning-based predictors to automatically assess progression risk in oral premalignancy digital pathology images. Each deep learning classifier will be built from patient histology samples and directly observed clinical outcomes. To accomplish the proposal tasks, we will build a global, multi-institution repository of more than 4000 patient samples: the Oral Premalignancy Repository for Deep Learning (OPR-DL), designed for deep learning research. This application responds to Notice of Special Interest NOT-CA-20-031, which seeks to “advance early detection of head and neck cancer (HNC) … distinguishing benign from malignant lesions”; “Discover … technologies that could complement currently available clinical methods (e.g. pathology)”; and “validate imaging-based applications and data analysis tools”. This tool could guide treatments, minimize unnecessary diagnostic interventions, and improve care in resource- constrained environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE: There is a critical need in oral healthcare to improve the pathological classification of those oral premalignant lesions that eventually progress to cancer from those that do not. In this proposal we plan to build a series of computational risk models using a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to quantify oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) progression risk directly from premalignancy digital pathology images. To accomplish this impactful task we will combine our clinical experience in oral pathology and OCSCC care, our leading-edge deep learning platform, and a multi-institutional data set of more than 4000 patient samples.",Deep learning for oral premalignancy evaluation,10427078,R56DE030958,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Pathology ', ' Oral Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' Mild Dysplasia ', ' Moderate Dysplasia ', ' Severe dysplasia ', ' Pathologist ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' interest ', ' Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Oral squamous cell carcinoma ', ' mouth SCC ', ' oral cavity SCC ', ' oral squamous cancer ', ' oral squamous carcinoma ', ' mouth squamous cell carcinoma ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' HNSCC ', ' Head and Neck Carcinoma ', ' SCCHN ', ' head and neck squamous cell cancer ', ' Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Institution ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' oral dysplasia ', ' oral premalignancy ', ' oral precancer ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' histological specimens ', ' histological samples ', ' histology samples ', ' histology specimens ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' computational pipelines ', ' learning classifier ', ' High grade dysplasia ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R56,2021,330611
"Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the FaceBase III Hub was created by the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to create a data repository to serve the entire community of dental and craniofacial researchers by sharing diverse data related to craniofacial development and dysmorphia, as well as other research communities that can leverage the diverse data that is in the FaceBase repository. One particularly unique and important element of FaceBase III is that it has over 22,000 facial images from over 11,000 human subjects, many of which are labeled with syndromes based on clinical and genomic diagnoses. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. While FaceBase embraces the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, there are unique concerns specific to AI/ML research including: presence of noise, uncertainty of labels, and bias within datasets. It is imperative that we remedy any limitations in the utility of FaceBase’s facial imaging data for AI/ML research. In this project, we propose to unlock the tremendous potential of FaceBase facial scans by identifying gaps in how data is characterized, formated, and preprocessed from the perspective of its use in AI/ML research and algorithm development. To accomplish this, we propose to initiate a pilot application that applies existing deep learning algorithms developed by investigators in this proposal to existing FaseBase data (Aim 1). The goal of the pilot is to identify how curation, organization and preparation of FaceBase data might be improved so as to streamline their use in ML/AI based investigations. Based on what we learn from the pilot, we will modify the current FaceBase self curation processes specifically around Facial Scans (Aim 2). This will require us to streamline our process associated with curation of human subject data, so that we have the necessary rich descriptive elements while maintaining required restrictions on data handling. Ultimately, the goal is to position the FaceBase Hub so that the existing facial scan resources become more broadly useful to AI/ML researchers. More significantly, we expect to see an increased availability with facial scan data and other associated data types, such as genotyping and neurofunctional data. By making the proposed improvements to our data ingest procedures, we anticipate that this proposal will allow FaceBase to scale to significantly larger data set sizes, and consequently, cementing and expanding its position as a unique resource to the broader NIH community of ML and AI researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Craniofacial dysmorphia is one of the leading causes of birth defects, and in recognition, the major goal of the FaceBase III project is to advance research by creating comprehensive datasets of craniofacial development and dysmorphologies and to disseminate these datasets to the wider research NIH research community. FaceBase currently contains many unique data sets that could be leveraged by machine learning and deep learning algorithms. A prime example of this is the extensive collection of 3D facial scans. Facial images are a critical resource for studying the correlation between genotype and phenotype and have received intense interest within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research field with notable advances in automated phenotyping. Current FaceBase data collections have not been curated with AI/ML as one of the target use cases. In this proposal, we will use a simple DL pilot to assess gaps in the FaceBase data curation practices and propose solutions to those caps so as to enhance the use of FaceBase data for emerging research based on AI/ML. .",Improving AI/ML-readiness of FaceBase Research Datasets,10412668,U01DE028729,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Joint structure of suture of skull ', ' Cranial Sutures ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Surgical sutures ', ' Sutures ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Yang ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' raised ICP ', ' raised intracranial pressure ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Calvaria ', ' calvarial ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Facies ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' malformation ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' prototype ', ' Secure ', ' FaceBase ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' craniofacial development ', ' data hub ', ' sharing hub ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' rare genetic disorder ', ' rare genetic disease ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' algorithm development ', ' data ingestion ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' data curation ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data handling ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,337557
"Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces ABSTRACT This administrative supplement is in response to the Notice of Special Interest to improve the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-Readiness of NIH-supported sata (NOT-OD-21-094). Summary of Parent Award. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems are used by people with communication and motor disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to communicate and interact with their environment. There are conventional AAC devices that are controlled by access methods such as touch, switch, head tracking and eye gaze; however, these access methods become difficult or impossible to use when sustained muscle control or voluntary motor control is lost. There are brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems, such as the P300 speller, that use sensory stimulation to elicit and then detect sensory neural responses in electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, communication with stimulus driven BCIs is suboptimal due to relying on inherently noisy EEG data and highly variable neural responses for BCI control. BCI communication rates can potentially be improved by leveraging information in EEG data in real-time to optimally tune the BCI system’s parameters to maximise BCI performance under conditions of uncertainty. This work investigates a novel closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm that optimises the stimulus presentation schedule of the P300 speller in real-time based on the measured EEG data and the BCI system’s belief about the user’s intent. Aim 1 develops and tests the novel algorithm in a cohort of abled- bodied individuals to evaluate the real-time feasibility and utility of closed-loop stimulus selection. Aim 2 will test the closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm in a cohort of individuals with ALS to assess the performance of the algorithm in target BCI end users. Goals of this Supplement. There is a current unmet need for large, diverse BCI datasets that include target BCI end users for BCI algorithm development, particularly with the popularity of data hungry deep learning models. Based on NIH-supported research for 10+ years, we have acquired a large amount of single- and multi-session data from P300 speller studies with abled-bodied participants and participants with ALS using different stimulus presentation paradigms. Guided by FAIR principles, in this supplement: (1) we will perform data curation, data cleaning and data engineering to develop a cross-platform readable P300 speller dataset with common data and metadata elements and make this dataset publicly available; and we will demonstrate the usability of this dataset in (2) an AI/ML application focused on developing robust data representations to mitigate the negative effect of variabilities in EEG data on AI/ML algorithms; and (3) in student research programs focused on skill development in data science and AI/ML. A large, inclusive and accessible BCI dataset will have significant impact in the BCI community and the broader AI/ML community, as it will support research to develop and compare novel data representations, stimulus paradigms and neural signal decoding algorithms towards establishing BCIs as viable AAC devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE People with significant motor disabilities often require assistive devices such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to communicate and interact with their environment. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide access to AAC systems and other devices for individuals with little to no voluntary muscle control in order to facilitate their communication with the outside world; however current BCI communication accuracies and speeds are suboptimal. The goal of this research effort is to develop and test the use of closed- loop optimisation techniques in BCI system design, where information from previous user responses and actions by the system is considered during the selection of the next action of the system. These closed loop techniques will be used to optimise BCI stimulus presentation parameters during real-time use to improve BCI communication efficiency, and demonstrated success of the proposed closed-loop stimulus optimisation method in real-time BCI use has the potential to accelerate the translation of BCI systems into viable AAC devices.",Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces,10412578,R21DC018347,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Refractory ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' spelling ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Belief System ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' file format ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' brain research ', ' motor control ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' student participation ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' learning community ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Learning Skill ', ' communication device ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data curation ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,266638
"Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program (COBIP) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the significant human health and disease burden in Africa, no biomedical data science graduate degree programmes in computational omics, clinical informatics and translational research are offered on the continent. To foster research training that will cultivate graduates able to respond with agility to future biomedical data science needs and develop innovative solutions to address African health challenges, formal interdisciplinary training in biomedical data science is needed. Such training opportunities should include: (i) Biomedical data science applied to data from multi-omics and other technologies, such as biomedical imaging, coupled with the ethical, legal and social Implications of these advances; (ii) Fundamental and advanced concepts in machine intelligence and computational paradigms for developing novel approaches for mining large-scale biomedical data; and (iii) Awareness, amongst graduates, of career opportunities within biomedical data science along with how the soft and hard skills gained in the training program could be transferred into a range of biotechnology/biomedical industries and research/professional careers. Motivated by these needs and leveraging the expertise in clinical and translational research as well as biomedical informatics at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), we propose to develop the “Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program” (COBIP) at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The program will introduce graduate degree programs to train African biomedical data scientists and faculty in rigorous fundamental data science, computational omics, clinical informatics and imaging data science. COBIP will lead to the development of solutions that address the African disease burden and are relevant to global health. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Develop an interdisciplinary data science training program focused on the health and healthcare needs and priorities of Africa; 2) Train faculty with relevant disciplinary backgrounds, from collaborating African institutions, in biomedical data science to support the development of the field across the continent; and 3) Establish COBIP as an international center of excellence in computational omics and biomedical informatics, distributed across African institutions as a collaborative network of faculty, researchers, and students focused on the African health priorities. COBIP will attract cohorts of trainees from diverse backgrounds including mathematics, statistics, informatics, computer sciences, engineering and biomedical sciences. COBIP will provide innovative educational infrastructure and research opportunities as well as links between clinicians, researchers and biomedical industries through placements and internships. COBIP, through its graduates, will have decisive impacts on African biomedical data science research and stimulate diagnostics, therapeutic selection and drug development to support improved human health and healthcare in Africa and globally. NARRATIVE For this Research Training Program, the University of Cape Town will partner with Oregon Health & Science University to provide interdisciplinary training opportunities to develop the next generation of researchers working on aspects of fundamental data science, computational omics and imaging data science. The Training Program will place strong emphasis on training graduate students and faculty from participating African institutions, through a combination of contact and on-line teaching, research projects and internships, to foster biomedical data science research that will build critical capacity in data science and drive the development of innovative solutions to African health challenges.",Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program (COBIP),10319196,U2RTW012131,"['Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mining ', ' Oregon ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' South Africa ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' international center ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' drug development ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' training opportunity ', ' Degree program ', ' Data Science ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' clinical imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' biomedical data science ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN,U2R,2021,346157
"Molecular Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence Based Tools to Innovate Covalent and Noncovalent Drug Design Abstract Cancer and infectious diseases are threatening modern human kind. To combat the challenge, targeted cova- lent inhibition and targeted protein degradation are emerging as the new frontiers in drug discovery. This SBIR project seeks to meet two unmet needs in the emerging covalent as well as traditional reversible drug discovery programs by developing two commercial solutions based on cutting-edge research in molecular simulations and data science. In the Phase I period, ComputChem LLC has developed a local/cloud software application iTitrate that can offer accurate and reliable predictions of protein pKa values and nucleophilic cysteine and lysine. As the ﬁrst of its kind, iTitrate is based on a unique and extensively validated constant pH molecular dynamics approach and a very accurate and efﬁcient generalized Born implicit-solvent model. In Phase I, ComputChem also devel- oped a prototype of a novel small-molecule pKa prediction tool based on artiﬁcial intelligence. Building on the Phase I progress, the objective of the Phase II project is to signiﬁcantly accelerate, enhance, and demonstrate the capabilities of iTitrate and improve the accuracy of iKa. iTitrate can be applied to expedite efforts in a vari- ety of covalent drug discovery programs, including targeted covalent inhibitor design; kinome or proteome wide scanning for covalently targetable sites; protein-protein interaction inhibition; and proteolysis targeting chimera design. iTitrate can be further developed and integrated with iKa to offer a novel solution for accurate protonation state assignment and pH-dependent modeling of protein-ligand complexes, which would add signiﬁcant value to computer-aided lead optimization and other in silico drug design tasks.

"High Performance Text Mining for Translator We propose to build a knowledge provider that will seek out, integrate and provide AI-ready, BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature. Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC) best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4) Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents. Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research, successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP. For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST, a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types. For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator. (4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9) Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers. The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature. Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?). Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments. We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces. Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing.

"Hawaii Data Science Training for RCMI Researchers Project Summary There is little doubt that biomedical science has become data intensive science. In the last decade, we have witnessed the booming of new biomedical technologies generate massive amounts of bio-data. This massive data includes various types of “omics”-data, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, petabytes of imaging, and so on. It is now feasible to access and mine the massive amount of clinical and phenotypic data. Data science skills involve how to use computational methods and algorithms to analyze, manage, and interpret different types of data, and require interdisciplinary knowledge such as biomedical domain knowledge, computational programming, statistics, and mathematics. Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) funded projects are often conducted in minority institutions and lack sufficient data science skills and data scientist experts to perform data intensive biomedical research. It is therefore essential to train data science skills for RCMI investigators. Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is difficult for Hawaii-based investigators studying health disparities to travel to the US continent to receive structured data science training and project-focused analytical support and interactive training. Hawaii investigators desperately need local data science trainers. The data science team at John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) University of Hawaii has rich experience in training data science skills to students and different levels of investigators, as well as supporting their data science needs in their research projects. In the proposal, we aim to train RCMI investigators with next generation data science skills. To reach the goal, we plan to accomplish the following aims. Aim 1: Provide education and training of data science-related skills to RCMI Researchers and their collaborators. Aim 2: Enhance collaborations between RCMI -funded researchers and data scientists. In addition to training RCMI investigators and their collaborators in a group in Aim 1, we will also offer individual data science training for investigators to foster collaborations between investigators and our data science experts. Project Narrative In the proposal, we aim to train investigators of Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI), who conduct health disparity research with next generation data science skills.

"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,10206222,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Accreditation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Societies ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Businesses ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' Review Committee ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Consent ', ' Sequencing Core ', ' DNA Sequencing Facility ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' student training ', ' sequencing platform ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' data dissemination ', ' ']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,550000
"Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation Genomic data hold the promise of revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of human disease. Multiple barriers stand between the acquisition of the data and realizing these and other benefits. Rapid accumulation of genomic data far exceeds our capacity to reliably interpret genomic variation. New developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with increased computing power and domain knowledge, provide hope for the deployment of enhanced computational tools in both basic research and clinical practice. Use of these methods critically depends upon reliable characterization of their performance.  The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (C-CAGI) will address these needs, through objective evaluation of the state of the art in relating human genetic variation and health. CAGI has had five editions since 2010 with 50 challenges posed to the community taken on by hundreds of predictors, leading to scores of publications about prediction methods and their assessment. We propose for C-CAGI to continue to advance the field of variant interpretation through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop community experiments to evaluate the quality of computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data. C-CAGI will conduct community experiments in which participants make bona fide blinded predictions of disease related phenotypes on the basis of genomic data. We will engage a diverse predictor community to spur innovation. The CAGI Ethics Forum will vet studies to ensure that privacy and sharing maintain the highest standards and will educate the community. 2. Assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data; highlight innovations and progress at interactive conferences. Predictions will be evaluated by independent assessors, who will be supported by new assessment approaches from C-CAGI. Results will be presented at CAGI experiment conferences with deep technical engagement, which will be interleaved with reflective CAGIâ meetings that create an environment for a comprehensive evaluation of the field, facilitating identification of major bottlenecks and problems faced by the current genome interpretation approaches. 3. Broadly disseminate the results and conclusions from the CAGI experiments and analysis. C-CAGI will outreach to the broader scientific and clinical community through its publications, and the creation of a calibrated reference integrated into the most common workflows for ready adoption. CAGI will also be represented at international meetings with presentations and workshops. 4. Operate effectively and responsively. C-CAGI will operate efficiently as it closely interacts with hundreds of participants. CAGI will build upon a robust information infrastructure that securely facilitates data dissemination, prediction submission, and assessment. Genomic variation is responsible for numerous rare diseases, for propensity for many common traits and diseases, for drug response, and is a key characteristic of cancer evolution. At present, our ability to characterize genetic differences far exceeds our capacity to interpret them either for basic research understanding or for clinical application.

"Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain Abstract Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. We refer to this ability as ‘ad hoc self-programming’: ‘ad hoc’ because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; ‘self-programming’ because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  Our previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. Our results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through them. In this proposal, therefore, we focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on our preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, we propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as ‘rules’ and ‘locations’, to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm.  These data suggest the existence of an ‘algorithmic state space’ represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, we will profit from our species’ powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. We therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem.  In Aim 1 we study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we test hypotheses regarding interactions between vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation.

"Evolution and optimization of synthetic <READ/WRITE> function from and into cells using genetic programming An immense advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence has transformed many aspects of our lives. The integration of artificial intelligence into the biomedical field allows us to solve complex biological problems that are the bottle neck of developing progressive diagnostic and therapeutic tools. One example is the need to manipulate the amino acid sequence of peptides to improve their function as bioactive molecules. Embarking on these new technologies, we developed a new machine learning tool that is based on a discipline known as “genetic programing” that can assist in designing new proteins and bioactive peptides. This new technology, termed Protein Optimization Evolving Tool (POET), can generate a model that describes the relationship between a peptide and its respective activity. Moreover, through cycles of protein evolution, we can significantly improve the model and consequently generate peptides with substantially improved function.  A major challenge of translating synthetic biology approaches to clinical treatment is the need to improve the communication with biological circuits in vivo. To that end, we will leverage the immense potential of the POET to produce proteins and peptides that can read and write information from and into cells.  Here we seek to improve, test and implement this model into three related, yet, independent aims. In the first aim, we will deploy the POET to develop an ultrasensitive peptide-based imaging agent for MRI based on proton exchange. Our preliminary data shows that through only few cycles of peptide evolution we surpassed the state-of-the-art similar peptides. In the second aim, we intend to use a similar approach to develop a novel MRI imaging probe based on T1 relaxation. We will use a metabolic engineering approach to express and load the peptide with Lanthanides, and the POET algorithm to improve the next generations. Lastly, in the third aim, we will use the POET for discovering new peptides for drug and gene delivery. We will utilize a novel platform for gene/drug delivery to test the efficiency of the peptides.  All three aims will start with computational design of peptides followed by an in vitro testing and several cycles of peptide evolution until the ultimate peptides are identified. All three aims will be ended by demonstration of the utility of those peptides in a clinically relevant question in an in vivo model followed by non-invasive imaging.  We anticipate that this innovative approach will open up a new avenue for developing powerful bioactive peptides and proteins to solve critical biological questions, and for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that can vastly benefit the well-being of numerous patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to combine an innovative machine learning algorithm with synthetic biology approaches to design new proteins that can read and write information from and into cells in vivo and consequently, to improve communication with synthetic biological circuits that precisely control diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

"Hidden Markov methodology for machine learning applied to identifying physiological states of shock in the intensive care unit via biomedical and unstructured text data PROJECT SUMMARY There is a void of well-developed machine learning tools for the clinical hospital setting for patient monitoring and diagnosis. This absence is particularly relevant for an intensive care unit (ICU), where structured and unstructured data are continuously recorded on numerous aspects of the health status of each patient. The methods that have been developed are predominantly exclusive to the research literature, and they are focused on models/algorithms trained on a single data type such as continuous response vitals data or natural language data. Likewise, the metrics to evaluate these machine learning tools are often focused on a single metric such as out-of-sample prediction error. For machine learning tools to really become effective they need to be built from models that are able to incorporate varying data types, simultaneously, for making inferences on the health state of a patient, and they need to be evaluated on a variety of metrics. Some of these metrics must be precise (e.g., out-of-sample prediction error and false negative/positive rate), but other qualitative metrics must also be considered such as clinical utility/feasibility, scalability, and the practicality of the user interface to a clinician. By analogy to hypothesis testing problems, there is an important difference between statistical signiﬁcance and practical signiﬁcance. The proposed research is aimed at developing statistical methodology to address these key aspects, and to engineer machine learning tools to be applied to hospital patient monitoring and diagnosis. In particular, the focus is on rapid identiﬁcation of critically ill patients at risk for bleeding and physiological de- terioration such as shock. For the purpose of this research, shock is divided into four categories: hypovolemic shock, distributive shock, neurogenic shock, and cardiogenic shock. Historical ICU patient encounter data is gathered with numerous examples of patients exhibiting each of these health states, as well as a baseline en- counters exhibiting no shock. However, the timeline and detection for clinician diagnosis of shock is not precise and is not without error. Accordingly, training data labels are only ever partially available, and the developed machine learning methodology will account for the semi-supervised nature of the problem. To make inference on the shock-related health state of ICU patients the machine learning methodology will incorporate a variety of response data types. These emitted responses include continuously monitored vitals data, laboratory results, functional wave form data on blood pressure, unstructured text data on clinician and procedural notes, and typi- cal cross-sectional data on medical history and demographic information. The data integration challenges from building all of these responses into a single parsimonious model will be a strong contribution of the proposed research. Additionally, the proposed research plan spans from the methodological development of the research ideas to production-end software with a clinical user-interface. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bleeding is often difﬁcult to detect at onset, leading to signiﬁcant delays in diagnosis and management accom- panied by progressive physiologic compromise, shock, and even death. Delays in the recognition and treatment of deteriorating patients have consistently been associated with increased mortality. The development and im- plementation of a coherent and interpretable machine learning framework for data-driven monitoring of the early detection of bleeding and shock in critically ill hospital patients is the public health relevance of the proposed research.",Hidden Markov methodology for machine learning applied to identifying physiological states of shock in the intensive care unit via biomedical and unstructured text data,10098894,R56HL155373,"['Blood Pressure ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Hypovolemic Shock ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Risk ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Cardiogenic Shock ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Tachycardia ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' TimeLine ', ' Custom ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Transfusion ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' blood product ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' neurogenic shock ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Allogenic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' data integration ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' public health relevance ', ' natural language ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Systemic blood pressure ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' statistical learning ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' data streams ', ' data framework ', ' algorithm training ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R56,2021,494527
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Cherokee Nation Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) 11 Abstract Major health disparities continue to impact tribal nations, yet a serious shortage of scientists conducting American Indian (AI) health disparities research persists. For several years, Cherokee Nation, the University of Oklahoma (OU) system, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) have partnered to address this issue by building tribal research capacity through the Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) mechanism. In this cycle of NARCH funding, the partnership among Cherokee Nation, OU, and OMRF continues and, importantly for student career enhancement, expands to include the Oklahoma State University (OSU) system as a key partner for student career enhancement activities. The overall mission of Cherokee NARCH is to develop durable research capacity within the context of an American Indian (AI) tribal nation to address health disparities. To achieve this goal, the five Specific Aims of Cherokee NARCH are: 1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a Leadership Team (LT) and a Tribal-Campus  Advisory Committee (TCAC), that ensures integration of career enhancement, capacity building, and  research activities; 2. to educate the next generation of researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the  context of tribal research, focusing on undergraduate, graduate and health professions students; 3. to build tribal capacity by developing a set of research codes to govern the conduct of genomic and other  biomedical research predicated on the concept of tribal data sovereignty; 4. to conduct innovative research and pilot research capable of seeding future research projects  performed by researchers seeking to work within the Cherokee Nation setting; and 5. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of student career enhancement,  capacity building, and research/pilot research projects, and evaluation of the overall Cherokee NARCH program. Cherokee NARCH provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in health disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens Cherokee NARCH by its remarkable success in the education of AI students in scientific and health professions fields, including the advent of the first tribally affiliated medical school in the US. Cherokee NARCH therefore provides an unprecedented environment in which a tribe, two research-intensive universities with large AI student populations (OU and OSU), and a biomedical research foundation (OMRF) will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable disparities in health that continue to affect AI people. / Narrative American Indian communities suffer disproportionately from a range of health disparities. Cherokee NARCH will expand authentic tribal capacity to address these disparities through a coordinated program of student career enhancement, capacity building, and research/pilot research activities directly providing research experiences for students in the Cherokee Nation setting. /",Cherokee Nation Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) 11,10223765,S06GM142119,"['Affect ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Health Professions ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Patients ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Students ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Cherokee ', ' Cherokee Indian ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Bariatrics ', ' gastric banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' obesity surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Reservations ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' next generation ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' health application ', ' evidence base ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Native American Research Center for Health ', ' NARCH ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NIGMS,CHEROKEE NATION,S06,2021,128044
"Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface (requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g., at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g., following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to- continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology- induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tough fibrous interfaces between tissues are a common location of injury and source of pathology, pain and disability. Surgical repairs of interfaces that are desirable proceed in the absence of knowledge of the mechanisms that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness, and unsurprisingly have very high failure rates of up to a nearly unbelievable 94%. By developing and testing the first mathematical models for the toughness of this class of interfaces, we hope to identify the mechanisms of toughening definitively, and more broadly to provide technology that enables design of improved surgical procedures.",Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics,10222575,R01AR077793,"['absorption ', ' Adhesions ', ' Adhesives ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' bone ', ' Bone Regeneration ', ' bone repair ', ' regenerate bone ', ' Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Botulinum A Toxin ', ' Botulinum Neurotoxin A ', ' Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Clostridium botulinum A Toxin ', ' botulinum toxin A ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Collagen ', ' Collagen Diseases ', ' collagen disorder ', ' collagenopathy ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hernia ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laparotomy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligaments ', ' Mesentery ', ' Mesenteric ', ' Minerals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pia Mater ', ' Running ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Friction ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' millimeter ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Skin ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' nano ', ' Tendinopathy ', ' Tendinitis ', ' Tendonitis ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanocrystal ', ' nano crystal ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' mechanical behavior ', ' treadmill ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,474719
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows.

"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,10175064,R01NS104585,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Head Movements ', ' Scientist ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' human data ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' multithreading ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' verification and validation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' pedagogy ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' source localization ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Data Scientist ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,543993
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists is time intensive, requires intensive training, and prone to introduce bias and error. Optical analysis of targets within tissue samples, cultures, or specimens is fundamental to detecting biological properties, including protein interaction within the central nervous system, sperm counts, digestive-system parasites, and immune response to viral infections like COVID-19. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce errors to clinical diagnostics. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting public confidence in scientific inquiry. Application of computer vision for cellular target detection is a promising approach to reducing human bias, subjectivity, and errors that limit the reproducibility of research and slow the development of effective medical treatments. Our image analysis software, called Pipsqueak AITM, and the underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed during our NIH SBIR Phase I award, have significantly increased inter- and intra-rater reliability of tissue sample analysis and decreased analysis time for multiplexed biomarkers. Pipsqueak AI is available now as an integration to ImageJ/FIJI (https://Pipsqueak.ai), and is capable of returning hundreds of accurate cellular target detections to the user within 300ms of image upload. During the last 6 months, Pipsqueak usership has exploded to over 1000 active monthly users, indicating high demand for computer vision technologies that improve the speed and accuracy of micrograph quantification. Our pre-trained ML models are capable of detecting multiple cellular morphologies and target types with precision and reproducibility that greatly exceed human analysis. Here, we propose to develop a pre-trained biomedical image analysis platform that rapidly and accurately identifies diverse cellular targets, and make this technology commercially available as a cloud computer vision service, called Sightologist.aiTM. Our computer vision AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) will be made available to research and clinical end-users through our Pipsqueak AI software and through 3rd party product integrations. To achieve these goals, we will build on our SBIR Phase I progress that developed ML models for biomarker detection, and implement cloud distribution methods to deliver our computer vision service to remote users and applications.
