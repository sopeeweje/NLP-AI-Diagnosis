"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging

"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of

"LIVOPT -- LIVer cirrhosis - Optimizing Prediction of Patient OuTcomes PROJECT ABSTRACT Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in millions of people and resulting in over 40,000 deaths each year, predominately in older people. These patients are at higher risk of serious complications (e.g. infection, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), hospitalization and death. Little is known about the epidemiology and disease progression and older patients are more vulnerable and might have different risk profiles. The clinical challenge is to accurately and early predict who is at highest risk for requiring hospitalization and/or death and understanding how this might be different in older versus younger adults. . One barrier to date has been the lack of an epidemiologically representative patient sample that captures those with cirrhosis and goes beyond one health system, as many data repositories are skewed or limited: CMS only captures elderly and those with debility, NIS does not allow longitudinal observation, UNOS represents less than one percent of those with cirrhosis. Hence, we will build on our previous work to use a unique dataset, the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset is extensive, allowing the use of traditional (e.g., regression) and novel analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning) to pursue the aims of the study. We aim to model cirrhosis progression in the elderly and to predict the risk of hospitalization and death in older patients with cirrhosis. We also aim to perform sub-group analyses focusing on race and socioeconomic factors in the elderly. The impact of accurate and early prediction of mortality and hospitalization risk in elderly patients with cirrhosis allows for targeted interventions of the most vulnerable patients to improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because liver cirrhosis affects a large segment of the elderly population with high mortality and high risk for decompensation requiring resource-intensive care, yet little knowledge exists about disease progression and risk prediction. We use a large population based dataset, Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN), which captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in a large metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis.

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,10210345,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' cyber security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' internet security ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social factors ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,322014
"Neural markers of impending task performance PROJECT ABSTRACT The neural mechanisms underlying successful cognitive performance are not well understood. In this R03 project, we will thoroughly investigate the ability to predict behavioral improvements through changes in shared underlying neural mechanisms. Identifying neural metrics that predict individual performance gains will ensure more reliable behavioral outcomes across diverse populations with varying cognitive capabilities and age ranges. Additionally, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying successful cognition will allow for rescuing of lost cognitive abilities and prophylaxis of cognitive decline in aging and other vulnerable populations such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recently identified several signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlated with cognitive performance improvements following and intervention with cognitive training and/or noninvasive neurostimulation. Specifically, frontal midline power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) correlates with improved divided attention ability and transfer to improved sustained attention ability in older adults (Anguera et al., 2013), and frontoparietal connectivity in the theta band is linked to improved attention (Anguera et al., 2013) and working memory (Jones et al., 2017). In addition to band- limited theta, we found that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta oscillations and temporo-parietal gamma (>30 Hz) activity tracked individual performance gains in working memory following intervention with training and neurostimulation (Jones et al., 2020). These findings suggest that theta oscillations, as measured by power, connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling in task-relevant regions, underlie individual differences in cognitive performance. Indeed, the application of noninvasive neurostimulation confirmed the critical role of theta oscillations in divided attention by showing that direct entrainment of frontal theta oscillations further enhanced performance (Hsu et al., 2017, 2018). The proposed research will determine the mechanisms by which theta oscillations, assessed at baseline, predict subsequent cognitive performance outcomes in aging and vulnerable populations. Critically, we identified preliminary evidence that an individual's intrinsic peak theta frequency predicted the efficacy of theta entrainment with neurostimulation on divided attention ability. This important preliminary result demonstrates that a nuanced approach to tailoring an intervention to the individual is feasible. Here, our analyses seek to predict subsequent performance during divided attention prior to intervention (Aim 1) and before trial onset in a range of cognitive tasks (Aim 2). We will conduct comprehensive regularized multiple regression and deep learning analyses on 13 existing EEG datasets, several of which share the same divided attention task, yet vary in participant demographics, including age and cognitive capability (healthy older and younger adults, multi-domain amnestic MCI patients), to develop a predictive model for an individually-tailored cognitive intervention. The results will inform future research that seeks to maximize the reliability of intervention protocols across demographics at any age or cognitive capability. PROJECT NARRATIVE This grant proposal seeks to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for behavioral improvement through novel secondary analyses on a variety of cognitive tasks (divided attention, working memory, perceptual discrimination) and participants that range from healthy younger adults, healthy older adults, and multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The goal will be to fit identified oscillatory neural metrics within a model that can predict cognitive performance through the use of advanced EEG and deep learning analyses.

"Unraveling the intersection of synaptic biology, lifestyle, and cognitive resilience PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Brain pathology begins accumulating in early adulthood and is detectable in almost all brains by older age. Yet, there is remarkable heterogeneity in cognitive aging, and most aged adults do not evidence cognitive impairment or dementia. Uncovering the naturally occurring processes that support this cognitive resilience to neuropathology burden may yield potent targets to prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We hypothesize that maintained synaptic integrity and physical activity may represent two such protective factors. Synaptic communication is the foundational underpinning of cognition. Increasing data suggest that preserved synaptic integrity may support clinical functioning regardless of pathology presence or etiology. Further, physical activity is a highly implicated resilience behavior that has also been linked to synaptic maintenance in animals. Our goal is to determine the synaptic biology that may underlie cognitive resilience and physical activity in humans. We will collaborate across two ADRC programs to leverage their unique strengths. In the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R-MAP), brain tissue samples from autopsied adults followed in life will be used to quantify >150 synaptic protein markers (n=869). In the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (UC-MAC), cerebrospinal fluid samples from longitudinally followed living older adults will be used to quantify seven synaptic protein markers (n=200). Both cohorts complete longitudinal actigraphy monitoring as an index of physical activity levels, and comprehensive neurobehavioral assessments. Cognitive resilience will be operationalized as the discrepancy between neuropathology markers and cognitive performances. Aim one will identify the in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP) and the longitudinal, dynamic nature (UC-MAC) between synaptic markers and cognitive resilience. Aim two will apply innovative machine learning techniques to identify precise actigraphy features that most robustly relate to in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP), longitudinal synaptic marker changes (UC-MAC), and cognitive resilience (both). Accomplishing these aims will significantly impact the ADRD field. We are designed to carefully identify synaptic and exercise features that support sustained cognitive resilience using cutting edge measurement technologies, analytics, and exceptional collaborative expertise. This proposal represents a bridging between two national ADRCs to more powerfully address high impact questions than could be answered by either individually. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching goal of this proposal is to better understand the biological and behavioral processes that support sustained cognitive resilience to brain aging. Successful completion of our collaborative project will more precisely determine the role of synaptic integrity and physical activity as candidate therapeutic targets to help prevent and slow Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).","Unraveling the intersection of synaptic biology, lifestyle, and cognitive resilience",10214288,R01AG072475,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10171740,R00AG054732,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Foundations ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' biopsychology ', ' psychobiology ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' comparative ', ' visual information ', ' healthy aging ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' information processing ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,247426
"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,10163115,R01AG054628,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' 3 year old ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' network architecture ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic predictors ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' connectome ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographic predictors ', ' socio-demographic predictors ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,470535
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",10150732,K99AG064030,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Award ', ' Calibration ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' performance tests ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Policy Research ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' effective intervention ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' clinical risk ', ' Patient risk ', ' health data ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' distinguished professor ', ' Data Science ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' random forest ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' social vulnerability ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,125185
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,10171753,R01AG063887,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Cognition ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Funding ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' cognitive change ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' coronary artery calcification ', ' coronary calcification ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' critical period ', ' treatment strategy ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' fasting glucose ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' brain health ', ' black/white disparity ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,740671
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly

"Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test Project Summary  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), a leading cause of disability among older adults, has become a critical public health concern. The clock-drawing test (CDT), which measures multiple aspects of cognitive function including comprehension, visual spatial abilities, executive function and memory, has been widely used as a screening tool to detect dementia in clinical research, epidemiologic studies, and panel surveys. The CDT asks subjects to draw a clock, typically with hands showing ten after 11, and then assigns either a binary (e.g. normal vs. abnormal) or ordinal (e.g. 0 to 5) score. An important limitation in large-scale studies is that the CDT requires manual coding, which could result in biases if coders interpret and implement coding rules in different ways.  Several small-scale studies have explored the use of machine learning methods to automate CDT coding. Such studies, which have had limited success with ordinal coding, have used methods that are not designed specifically for complex image classification and are less effective than deep learning neural networks (DLNN), a new and promising area of machine learning. More recently, machine learning methods have been applied to digital CDT (dCDT), a form of CDT that uses a digital pen and tablet. Despite some promising results on small- scale data, thus far dCDT studies have only attempted to code binary categories.  The proposed study will develop advanced DLNN models to create and evaluate an intelligent CDT Clock Scoring system – CloSco – that will automatically code CDT images. We will use a large, publicly available repository of CDT images from the 2011-2019 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a panel study of Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older funded by the National Institute on Aging. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop an automated CDT-coding system for both ordinal and continuous scores; 2) Evaluate the performance of the CloSco system and investigate the value of continuous CDT scoring for dementia classification and longitudinal CDT models; and 3) Prepare and disseminate NHATS public-use files and documentation with ordinal and continuous CDT codes assigned using CloSco along with the CloSco DLNN program. If successful, the DLNN programs may offer a model for automating coding of other widely available drawing tests used to evaluate a variety of cognitive functions. Project Narrative This project aims to improve dementia detection by automating coding of a widely used dementia screening test, the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). The proposed research will improve CDT-coding in large scale studies, facilitate longitudinal analysis of CDT performance, and improve dementia classification particularly for mild cognitive impairment.",Exploring the Use of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Improve Dementia Detection: Automating Coding of the Clock-Drawing Test,10293176,R21AG073971,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Elements ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Error Sources ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Categories ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' performance tests ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease test "", ' Alzheimer Disease test ', ' Alzheimer test ', "" Alzheimer's test "", ' test for Alzheimer ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,406555
"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network Extension for Socially Vulnerable Older Adults ABSTRACT The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, as measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Data also support a significant association between neighborhood-level area deprivation indices with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. Despite emerging evidence linking social determinants of health with disparities in postoperative outcomes in older adults, investigations in these areas increasingly require expertise with disparate subject matters, including clinical perioperative practice, geriatrics, neuropsychology, social determinants of health, geospatial analyses, and even artificial intelligence. The K07 applicant is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded independent investigator and fellowship-trained anesthesiologist with expertise in regional anesthesia and orthopedic surgery, as well as research experience in machine learning, geospatial disparities, and perioperative pain and cognition. The purpose of this proposal is to promote institutional and community awareness of how social vulnerabilities impact perioperative outcomes in older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and particularly those outcomes related to postoperative pain and cognition. The overall strategy of this proposal is to develop interdisciplinary research infrastructure along with transdisciplinary training programs to crosspollinate research teams. This structure will be organized via the Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network-Social Vulnerability (PeCANSV) construct in three aims: Aim 1: Convene a PeCANSV multidisciplinary advisory team to establish three supplemental cores in 1) geospatial infrastructure; 2) social determinants of health; 3) artificial intelligence. Aim 2: Accelerate research discovery through interdisciplinary research pathways by formalizing nascent linkages between supplemental PeCANSV cores and UF resources and extant geospatial, environmental, cognitive, and clinical perioperative databases at UF Health and throughout Florida. Aim 3: Develop a transdisciplinary workforce of clinical and basic science researchers to lead interdisciplinary teams addressing the social vulnerability of older adult surgical patients. Milestones include regular analysis of strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results, interdisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success in perioperative research in social disparities of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.  NARRATIVE The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, measured by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Via the K07 mechanism and associated institutional support, the applicant will develop transdisciplinary research training and infrastructure involving geospatial data, social determinants of health, and artificial intelligence to address these challenges.

"Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency (LEP) are at high risk of receiving suboptimal, goal-discordant care because of language and cultural barriers to effective communication about goals of care. Palliative care provides a way to improve quality of life and facilitate goal- concordant care by supporting effective person-family-clinician communication, but is under-utilized by older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. No studies have sought to identify targets for intervention to address barriers to palliative care at multiple levels (i.e., patient/family, clinician, system, and community- levels) for this vulnerable population. Addressing this gap will be essential for the development of effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. The long-term goal of this work is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate interventions to facilitate culturally-sensitive palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. The rationale for this study is that before effective culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP can be developed, quantitative and qualitative data is needed to evaluate the scope of existing inequities and identify modifiable multi-level barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for this population. Aim 1 utilizes quantitative methods to compare the quality of care received by decedents with advanced Dementia and LEP to those with English proficiency in four key palliative care domains (utilization of care, documentation of patient goals and preferences, symptom assessment, and circumstances of death) using EHR-based quality metrics and novel machine learning methods. Aim 2 utilizes qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (older adults with Dementia and LEP and their family members, caseworker-cultural mediators and interpreters, and clinicians and administrators) to identify modifiable targets for intervention across multiple levels. Aim 3 utilizes qualitative interviews with leaders of community-based organizations to assess community-level resources and capacity to support high quality palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Our interdisciplinary team is experienced in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia research, community engagement with LEP populations, and quantitative and qualitative methods. The proposal is innovative because it evaluates multi-level barriers to palliative care across three diverse LEP populations (Latinx, Chinese, and Vietnamese), and uses machine learning methods to evaluate the quality of care across several palliative care domains in a large health system. The proposed research is significant because these data will enable the identification and prioritization of multi-level targets for the development of culturally and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. Ultimately, this work will advance a model of care that facilitates goal-concordant, high-quality care for older adults with Dementia and LEP and supports the palliative care needs of their family members. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents an innovative multi-level approach to identifying targets for effective interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency through improved palliative care. These results will enable the identification and prioritization of modifiable factors to inform effective and scalable strategies to facilitate goal-concordant care for this vulnerable population. The proposed research addresses the NIA's mission to eliminate disparities and improve the well-being of older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and their family caregivers.",Understanding and Improving Inequities in Palliative Care for Older Adults with Advanced Dementia and Limited-English Proficiency: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation,10300274,R01AG074253,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Administrator ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' advanced dementia ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Latinx ', ' Prognosis ', ' disparity elimination ', ' eliminate disparities ', ' eliminating disparities ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,693147
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' computer science ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' patient population ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Bibliography ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Writing ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Study Section ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' systematic review ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' support network ', ' webinar ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infection ', ' COVID-19 infection ', ' COVID19 infection ', ' SARS-CoV2 infection ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infection ', ' infected with COVID-19 ', ' infected with COVID19 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV2 ', ' infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying

"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10238860,R61AG068945,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Herpes zoster disease ', ' Herpes Zoster ', ' Shingles ', ' Zona ', ' Zoster ', ' herpes zona ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pneumococcal Infections ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections ', ' pneumococcal disease ', ' pneumococcus infection ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Preventative health service ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vendor ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' peer ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' operation ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,288540
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,10224045,P01AG005842,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' India ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oregon ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Social Values ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' data access ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' Health trends ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' well being trends ', ' data resource ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' public health insurance ', ' public insurance ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2021,1737917
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Longitudinal Fall Risk in Older Adults ABSTRACT My goal is to establish myself as an independent biostatistical researcher who develops and validates prediction models that are critical to identifying older adults at high risk of adverse health outcomes using novel machine learning methodology. My passion for developing prediction models for health outcomes in older adults stems from my desire to help people, especially older adults who are vulnerable. I developed a machine learning method called Binary Mixed Model (BiMM) forest, which is particularly suited for developing prediction models for repeated measures of outcomes in older adults because it accommodates dynamic fluctuations over time which are common in aging (e.g., functional status). Environment: Wake Forest School of Medicine is a nationally-recognized leader in geriatric research and provides an outstanding environment for accomplishing my goals. Mentors: I have an excellent interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of experts in aging, biostatistics and informatics who are dedicated to supporting me in completing the research and training aims proposed in this K25 grant. Training: I will complete activities aimed to address gaps in my training with the guidance of my mentoring team. My Training Objectives are to 1) acquire knowledge about gerontology and geriatrics, 2) deepen my understanding of missing data mechanisms and techniques, 3) learn about the appropriate use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research purposes, and 4) develop leadership, networking, communication and grant writing skills. To accomplish these objectives, I will attend conferences, seminars, journal club, case conferences and writing workshops, observe a geriatric clinician, and complete coursework. The K25 grant will allow me to extend previous training, which will provide me superior knowledge, experience and skills for my future as a biostatistical researcher in aging. Research: Early identification of older adults at-risk of falling is critical so that preventative care plans may be implemented to improve patient outcomes and reduce burden on the health care system. Most current prediction models cannot handle repeated measurements over time and have not been used with EHR data. I propose to use my BiMM forest method to develop a prediction model for fall risk over time. My Research Specific Aims are to 1) impute (fill in) missing predictor data in Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with a novel machine learning method (BiMM forest); 2) develop a prediction model for identifying older adults at-risk for falls; and 3) assess the feasibility of using EHR data to externally validate the prediction model. The prediction model developed in this proposal will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls, allowing providers to intervene early to reduce the burden of falls for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Results from this grant will provide a basis for future R01 submissions to further validate the prediction model using EHR data from multiple health care centers and evaluate the clinical utility of the model in practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying older adults at-risk for falls is critical for implementing preventative interventions aimed at reducing adverse outcomes, but developing prediction models for fall-risk remains challenging due to analytic shortcomings, missing data, and limitations of electronic health record (EHR) data. This K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award provides Dr. Jaime Lynn Speiser with essential training in aging, missing data methodology, EHR data analysis, and career development to facilitate her transition into an independent biostatistical researcher in aging.

"Longitudinal validation of cerebral small vessel disease biomarkers in diverse community-based older adults without dementia ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) encompasses a range of common processes and pathologies (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, small vessel atherosclerosis, small and microscopic infarcts and bleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and white matter disease) that we and others have shown are associated with impaired cognition and dementia (VCID). High-quality biomarkers of SVD are critically needed to advance the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of small vessel VCID. The mission of the MarkVCID consortium has been to identify the most promising biomarkers of SVD and conduct analytical (instrumental) validation and preliminary clinical validation. Our team at Rush University Medical Center and Illinois Institute of Technology was privileged to be active participants in this initial work. We are now eager to continue this collaborative effort with this proposal. The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise, experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance. Specifically, we propose to recruit, enroll, and longitudinally assess a large, diverse, community-based group of older adults without dementia using MarkVCID clinical evaluation and biomarkers, to test the hypotheses that the biomarkers are associated with cognitive decline and SVD neuropathologic indices. This will be a nested sub-study of participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), Religious Orders Study (ROS), Clinical Core (CC), and Latino Core (LATC) of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, which are on-going longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates. MARS and CC recruit exclusively African Americans, and LATC recruits Latino older adults. Our past contributions to MarkVCID support our current aims. First, we demonstrated our ability to recruit and follow a large and diverse group of non-demented older adults, some of whom died, enabling autopsy studies. Second, we developed and made publicly available a novel biomarker of arteriolosclerosis with high performance, named ARTS, which we trained using machine learning on MRI and pathology data. Third, we contributed to the analytical and initial clinical validation of multiple MarkVCID biomarkers. Fourth, we led the MarkVCID imaging biomarkers committee and were active in all functions of the consortium. We propose to leverage our expertise and infrastructure to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID biomarkers in a diverse population, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise, experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance.

"Tele-CF: A practical platform for remote monitoring of cognitive frailty ABSTRACT Cognitive frailty (CF), the combined presence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment, is a strong and independent predictor of cognitive decline over time. The International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics and the International Academy on Nutrition and Aging have recommended the use of cognitive frailty assessment to track the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) towards dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and loss of independence. However, there is no practical tool for assessment of CF during telehealth visits. This is especially important as telehealth is growing in popularity amongst older adults and increasingly accepted by healthcare payers, and as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated these trends. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a software-based solution that enables remote assessment of CF during telehealth visit and can be integrated into existing telehealth systems. In Phase I, we successfully designed a prototype of a novel CF measurement tool, called Tele-CF, that uses deep learning-based image processing to remotely measure CF. The Tele-CF algorithms extracts kinematic features of the forearm motion from a video of 20-second elbow flexion and extension, and quantifies weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion (which are phenotypes of frailty) to generate a frailty index (FI). FI ranges from zero to one, with higher values indicating progressively greater severity of frailty. When applied under dual-task conditions (e.g., while simultaneously performing a working memory task), Tele-CF can also screen cognitive impairment. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility and proof of concept validity of Tele-CF for use in older adult population (n=29, age: 78.6±6.5), including 18 subjects with MCI or mild dementia, by comparing the results against validated tools (a sensor-based tool for in-clinic frailty assessment, dual-task gait, and a clinical cognitive scale, MMSE). After successfully achieving all milestones of Phase I, we are proposing to complete the development of Tele-CF and carry out a clinical study to demonstrate the ability of Tele-CF for remote tracking of CF over a 12-month period and to predict decline in CF at 12 months. To achieve the clinical aim of the study, we will recruit 100 adults (age 60+) with clinically confirmed MCI or mild dementia including 50 subjects without physical frailty and 50 subjects with physical frailty. All subjects will be assessed in clinic using conventional cognitive-motor assessment tools, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and also remotely starting from the baseline every two months using Tele-CF. Tele-CF provides an easy-to-use desktop application for remote assessment of CF for clinicians that works with existing telehealth platforms. Tele-CF desktop application will enable clinicians to identify, document, and track CF in older patients. In addition, Tele-CF will have broader applications in collection and analysis of video biomarkers in telehealth and clinical trials.

"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) ABSTRACT Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults (ages 65+). Injuries due to falling result in 2.8 million emergency visits annually, and 25% of falls result in very serious injuries (such as fractures or traumatic brain injury). Through this diversity supplement, Dr. Monroe Kennedy, an engineer interested in aging research, seeks to get training and mentoring in geroscience. As part of this diversity supplement, Dr. Kennedy, proposes to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can alert the wearer to risk of falling and potentially prevent falls. Combined with a robust training plan, the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Kennedy to become a leader in geriatrics research and make impactful contributions to the field of aging research.  Aim 1 will be to conduct focus groups with older adults on the wearable smartbelt device, such as style and comfort. Aim 2 will test the wearable smartbelt device by collecting visual and sensor data from older adults while walking on various surfaces at slow and brisk paces. The data will be used to train the falls prevention model utilizing machine learning methods. The ultimate goal is for the model to be able to calculate fall risk by predicting potential walking trajectories of the wearer and imbalance and alert the wearer via vibrotactile response if the risk of falling is probable. By preventing falls from occurring in the first place, the proposed device has the potential to greatly increase the overall well-being, long-term health, and independence of older adults as well as costs associated with hospital visits and caregiving.

"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents.

"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,10186677,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population - AI/ML Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole.

"Administrative Supplement to Support Collaborations to Improve AI/ML-Readiness SUMMARY This application is for an administrative supplement (revision) to an existing award, R33AG068931, ""Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets."" The goal of the parent study is to create a comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory datasets and to demonstrate their utility for aging research at Rutgers University through 4 specific aims: 1) Harmonizing and merging multiple data sets to generate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels and across multiple domains, 2) Developing state-of-the-art analytic methods to identify patterns of aging trajectories experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes, 3) Discovering multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajectories using both model-based approaches and machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes, and 4) Disseminating resources generated including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology. For the supplement, new work in the CMS Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC) will create AI/ML-ready datasets, workflows, and source code for data cleaning and pre-processing, breaking the siloed barriers between researchers working in the VRDC and institutional data enclaves at Universities. Data harmonization procedures need to be customized to the server architecture and resources of each data warehouse, necessitating VRDC-specific workflows and code to ensure timely access and reproducibility. In this project, data are made AI/ML-ready in four stages: 1) the cohort of patients to be studied is defined and key inclusion and exclusion criteria variables are selected; 2) data pre-processing steps include data cleaning, data annotation, formatting, standardizing taxonomies, variables transformation, data rescale/normalization, variable aggregating, variable decomposing and variable selection with a focus on variables important to measure health disparities and improve minority health and reduce health disparities; 3) feature extraction and engineering include generating derived variables (e.g., intercept, slope, average, etc.) from irregularly spaced individual trajectories; and 4) Medicare data sets are merged with publicly available data to add socioeconomic and environmental context, and data variable relationships are mapped to produce a final, AI/ML-ready data. Supplement Aim. Develop and implement code for data pre-processing, data fine-tuning and precision, missing data imputation, data connectivity and fully established hierarchical relationships for the AI/ML framework to interactively model late-life aging trajectories and selected outcomes in a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries. Completion of this work will contribute to the NIH vision of a modernized and integrated biomedical data ecosystem that adopts the latest data science technologies, and best practice guidelines including FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles and open-source development. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the health and social care needs of an aging population. The interaction between individual and environmental factors that impact clinical aging outcomes in the final years of life are explored using state-of-the-art analytic methods.

"Protein Signatures of APOE2 and Cognitive Aging Improving AI/ML readiness of data generated under the R01: Protein signatures of APOE2 and AG061844 “Protein signatures of APOE2 and cognitive aging”, we are generating proteomic and metabolomics data in a cohort of centenarians, their offspring, and unrelated controls from the New England Centenarian Study (NECS). Study participants have been characterized with detailed medical history, genetic profiles, and longitudinal assessment of physical and cognitive functions. The goal of the parent R01 is to validate a proteomic signature of APOE genotypes, and to evaluate its value together with metabolic profiles to predict patterns of cognitive function change in aging individuals. We plan to share data through the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) portal, and the new extreme longevity (EL) portal that is currently under development. Sharing the data in an unrestricted manner is not possible because they include HIPAA identifiers, particularly age >89. Unrestricted sharing of data would be an attractive option for AI/ML investigators, and the goal of this request for administrative supplement is to cognitive aging. Funded by the NIA: R01 use advanced machine learning techniques to generate high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the data obtained in the parent achine learning methods have emerged that can be used to generate synthetic data using a model that is trained in the real data. This model can be used to generate a synthetic data set in which no single data point corresponds to a real person in the original data set, but the synthetic data can be analyzed to produce results that are like those derived from the original data. This approach has received substantial attention in the past few years, and it has been adopted to compromise between data sharing and privacy, including generation of synthetic data for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We have put together a team of data scientists and partners from the company Syntegra R01 so they can be shared without restriction. M , to generate and validate a synthetic data set that matches the data generated with the parent R01. Our proposal is structured in three aims. In Aim 1, we will share with Syntegra real data from the NECS that include proteomics and metabolomics, genetic variables and patients’ characteristics including assessment of cognitive function. This real data will be used to train the data generation model and create synthetic data sets. In Aim 2 we will d evelop a protocol for validation of the synthetic data sets that includes fidelity to a variety of results of machine learning analyses and metrics to assess the deidentification of data. In Aim 3 we will conduct the analysis in the real and synthetic data sets and compare the results. Impact. This is a high risk, but potentially high return proposal. If the approach works, we will be able to generate data that can be widely shared with the community. The approach will also be applicable to several other studies of aging that struggle with the issues of data sharing to enhance scientific research while preserving privacy. Narrative The goal of this application is to develop a model trained in real data generated from the parent R01 and use the model to simulate a high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, synthetic versions of the real data that can be shared without restriction. The impact of this strategy is to simplify sharing data with the AI/ML community, thus increasing the usability of the data and the potential impact of the parent R01.

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,10440656,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' cyber security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' internet security ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social factors ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,78373
"Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable Abstract: Widely-scalable methods for the earlier detection of elevated Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) would enable earlier intervention and can help reduce/delay disease incidence. Consumer wearable technologies that passively gather “big data” signals could be leveraged to detect the early signs of elevated ADRD risk (see NOT-AG-20-017), in a relatively inexpensive and scalable fashion. One promising set of signals that can be captured by consumer wearable devices, but are currently only assessed in research settings, reflects the Circadian Activity Rhythm (CAR). Human activity follows a predictable 24-hour pattern known as the CAR. Various CAR characteristics are disrupted in ADRDs, reflect ADRD biomarkers levels (even in the pre-clinical stage), and predict future cognitive decline. However, observational studies have yet to conclusively demonstrate which CAR measure(s) best signal early-stage ADRD processes, and could help with early risk stratification. Previous studies have used subsets of the available CAR metrics to establish associations, rather than leveraging multiple metrics to improve ADRD risk prediction. We propose that using a comprehensive panel of CAR metrics could identify combinations of CAR metrics that are sensitive to ADRD risk. Furthermore, we propose that the translation of research findings into clinical screening has been difficult because CAR measurement relies on researcher-, rather than clinic-/user-, friendly systems. To fill these gaps, we propose leveraging consumer wearables, existing data, sleep/circadian science, and machine learning. Our overarching goal is to evaluate evidence for a path forward, from observing associations, towards clinically useful ADRD risk detection with consumer wearables. Our team includes experts in sleep/CAR-related health risks (Dr. Smagula, PI); neuropsychology and activity in aging (Dr. Gujral, co-I); and time series analytics/statistical learning (Dr. Krafty, co-I). We partnered with leaders of major cohorts (see letters of support) that provide the initial data. Aim 1 will compute a comprehensive panel of CAR measures in a sample of 766 adults aged 50+; then use machine learning to develop algorithms leveraging CAR measures to predict the likelihood of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; a diagnostic marker of elevated ADRD risk). Aim 2 will use a new testing sample (n=25 with and n=25 without MCI) to validate if applying this algorithm to data from a consumer-wearable accurately detects MCI. Dr. Smagula already developed a working prototype measuring CARs using the Apple Watch called the Circadian Activity Profiling System. This R21 can have impact on the field of ADRD risk detection by producing: evidence regarding which CAR metrics best signal MCI; an initial algorithm that combines information regarding CARs to passively detect the likelihood of MCI; and by refining our system for collecting these signals on a popular consumer wearable (the Apple Watch). We will also develop collaborations with additional cohorts so that, if we find evidence supporting potential clinical utility of this approach, we will be prepared to develop a definitive algorithm in an R01 using data from multiple studies. Project narrative: Evidence shows that circadian rest-activity rhythm (CAR) disruption correlates with dementia biomarkers in the pre-clinical phase, and predicts increased likelihood of future dementia incidence. Using archival data and consumer wearables, this project will develop and test a widely-scalable system to identify individuals who have elevated dementia risk by virtue of their CAR profile. Deliverables are an initial predictive algorithm, partnerships with additional sources of archival data for future work, and initial validation that this approach can discriminate between older adults with and without early signs of increased dementia risk.",Combining information from multiple circadian activity rhythm metrics to optimally detect mild cognitive impairment using a consumer wearable,10300129,R21AG074094,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Activities ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Fractals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' R21 Award ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' systematic review ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' user-friendly ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' primary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' modifiable behavior ', ' Apple watch ', ' applewatch ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' statistical learning ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' glymphatic clearance ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,245140
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness.

"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ',

"Auracle: An AI-Enabled Telecare System to Support the Independence and Safety of Individuals with AD/ADRD and Other Dementias ABSTRACT Dementia rates are growing at an alarming rate in all regions of the world and are related to population aging. It is estimated that over 30 million people have dementia, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year - one new case every 7 seconds. The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60% in 2001, rising to 71% by 2040). The prevalence of dementia rapidly increases from about 2-3% among those aged 70–75 years to 20–25% among those aged 85 years or more. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia among western countries, corresponding to about 60% of cases while vascular dementia (VaD) is the second, with about 20% of all cases. Around 10% of adults over 65 develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, while less severe than other forms of dementia, does impact everyday living and is a precursor of Alzheimer's. Dementia caregiving, perhaps more than any other type, places tremendous burdens on the physical, psychological, social, and financial wellbeing of the 4 million people providing informal care to seniors with dementia. Family caregiving, accompanied by emotional strain, was an independent risk factor for mortality among older adults. The majority of family care for older adults with dementia is carried out by either wives or daughters. Home caregiving may have negative acute effects on both psychosocial and physiological responses, especially in daughters. As functional impairment increases, during the course of AD/ADRD, caregivers require more assistance and access to resources to properly manage symptoms and, thereby, avoid an elder’s institutionalization. Greater support can also reduce the detrimental impact of stress on the caregiver. Technology that can support caregivers in monitoring the activity, safety and wellbeing of seniors with dementia in the homecare setting can significantly increase the quality of life for seniors and their family members as well as reduce costs to them and the healthcare delivery system. Unfortunately, current, outdated systems are of limited utility. We propose a technically advanced, but easy to use, low cost telecare system called Auracle. Auracle will utilize a unique combination of AI algorithms that will analyze data collected from a mesh network of innovative IoT modules placed throughout the home of the elder being monitored. This highly autonomous system combines a plug and play, compact form-factor with a voice interface. Auracle will be designed to improve the safety, quality of life and wellbeing of people with AD/ADRD or other dementias of aging and provide badly needed support to caregivers who provide their care. NARRATIVE Dementia rates are growing at an alarming rate in all regions of the world and are related to population aging. Alzheimer’s disease (AD/ADRD) is the most common type of dementia.

"Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities ABSTRACT Weather and climate disasters are responsible for over 13,000 deaths and $1.7 trillion additional costs over the last 40 years in the USA. Older adults are particularly susceptible to respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decreased quality of life after disaster exposure to particulates, mold, and flooding. Our preliminary data reveal those with Black racial identities possess fewer resources to prepare for disaster. Profound racial disparities observed in the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the devastating sequelae of long-standing macro-level disparities of segregated housing and sociopolitical networks. The long-term goal of this work is to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. The short-term goal of this research is to identify pathways of equal opportunity and disaster affirmative action interventions. The objective here is to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a novel, valid and reliable assessment tool of disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Our specific aims are to 1) Empirically validate a novel assessment tool of disaster vulnerability using self-reported items and scoring system, 2) Refine the validated instrument with a machine learning based algorithm for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) Assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for Black participants in household hazard vulnerabilities and our instrument development process, and 4) Test interoperability with existing customer software platforms as a plug-in software add-on. We will accomplish these aims using a mixed-methods approach, recruiting 20 expert panel members and up to 600 potential end-user participants, working to over-sample those who reside in predominantly Black communities and Black racial identities. The knowledge gained from this study will provide foundational work to develop precision interventions to reduce post-disaster respiratory symptoms, disease exacerbation, unscheduled health care utilization, and decrements in respiratory quality of life. The results of this study will inform the next generation of electronic health record and patient reported outcomes applications, ensuring the validity, prognostic accuracy, and machine learning models are most relevant to those at highest risk for racial disparities: those with Black racial identities. Health care providers can use our software tool to target and optimize disaster telehealth service lines and increase intervention precision to reduce disaster morbidity and mortality disparities. Our goal is to identify pathways of equal opportunity or precision affirmative action interventions to eliminate racial disparities in large scale disaster health outcomes. Here, we propose to create a software prototype of a machine learning algorithm with a valid and reliable measure to score household occupant disaster vulnerability for older adults with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, prioritizing mathematical modeling of equality of opportunity to reduce racial bias and disparity. Collecting and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data, we aim to: 1) validate a novel assessment instrument, 2) test the instrument for precision prediction of household emergency preparedness for disaster, 3) assess racial disparities, data and algorithm bias for those with Black racial identities, and 4) test the interoperability of our novel software prototype with existing electronic health record platforms.",Precision Assessment Algorithm for Reducing Disaster-related Respiratory Health Disparities,10401726,R43MD017188,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disasters ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments PROJECT SUMMARY There is a global upsurge of falls in older adults that impacts nearly every family across the world. Millions of older adults fall each year in the United States, leading to catastrophic injuries, deaths and soaring healthcare costs. Over the last decade, 911 fall calls have tripled while transport rates to the hospital after a fall have significantly decreased. Instead, 911 is increasingly used for lift assists (falls that do not result in transport). Deployment of emergency medical services for lift assists diverts care from higher acuity emergencies and costs more than 200 million dollars annually in the United States. There is a potentially powerful yet underutilized solution if we leverage the hidden opportunities of fall events, such as lift assists that do not result in catastrophic consequences, to activate prevention strategies. This study aims to develop a scalable strategy for early identification of individuals at high risk of falls and activate prevention solutions. We hypothesize that a systematic 911 fall call intake which has a broader concept of frailty, Frailty And Cognition+Environment (FaCE), will better account for the compounding and cascading nature of fall risks in older adults. At the completion of this project a scalable machine learning model which incorporates FaCE factors to predict high utilization of 911 for falls will be developed. In addition, we will characterize barriers and facilitators for adoption, implementation, and maintenance of fall prevention strategies in the home for patients with FaCE risk factors. This project will utilize a blend of systems science and community-based participatory research approaches and state of the art predictive analytics to elucidate the FaCE of falls, develop a scalable fall prevention solution that can be implemented nationwide and inform a larger-scale implementation trial for using 911 fall calls to activate effective fall prevention strategies in homes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Healthcare costs for falls have reached 55 billion dollars annually in the US with falls in older adults impacting nearly every family, in every sector, of every community. Leveraging 911 fall calls as activation events could transform our ability to identify high risk individuals and significantly impact fall prevention strategies. At the completion of this study, a scalable EMS fall prediction tool will be developed to elucidate the impact that frailty, cognitive impairment and the home environment have on emergency fall events in order to activate and transform effective fall prevention solutions in the homes of vulnerable older patients.",Transformative Solutions for Reducing Frequent 911 Fall Calls in the Homes of Patients with Cognitive Impairments,10339728,K76AG068435,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' high risk ', ' 911 call ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K76,2021,242041
"Development of machine learning software to quantitatively map telomere induced senescence in tissue sections during aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cellular senescence is a pillar of aging, acting as a key driver of aging and age-related diseases. Telomeres play a major role in cellular senescence. When telomeres become critically short or damaged, they elicit a DNA damage response (DDR) that drives senescence. Our laboratory developed sophisticated methods to detect senescent cells in tissues based on the co-localization between telomeres and the DDR. Furthermore, we recently developed SenoQuant, a software that simplifies the measure of Telomere associated foci (TAF), reducing quantification time from weeks to hours. We now propose to apply emerging technologies such as machine learning and deep learning to map TAF more accurately and robustly in human tissue sections. This will address several challenges inherent to TAF analysis, including nuclei detection, staining artifacts, and quantification time. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Tissue Mapping Centers we will tailor SenoQuant to the analysis of specific human tissues. Finally, we propose to integrate TAF with multiplexed imaging methods such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), allowing the detection of multiple senescence markers in tissues simultaneously. We anticipate that this technology will greatly advance the spatially-resolved mapping of senescent cells in human tissues and will be a great resource for the aging and cell senescence community. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the nature and distribution of senescent cells in human tissues during the aging process.

"Multi-omics approach to frailty resilience Frailty is a complex clinical condition that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and high risk for mortality in older adults. Identifying biological mechanisms that protect from frailty is an important step in the development of effective therapies that protect from and delay frailty. Aging is a major risk factor for frailty; thus, studying biological mechanisms and populations that delay aging may lead to the identification of molecular factors that can protect from frailty. The biological approaches thus far have mainly focused on descriptive phenotypes, such as inflammatory plasma profile and candidate gene approaches, looking for risk factors for frailty. It is apparent, however, that frailty is a complex syndrome, akin to other complex disorders; thus, simplistic approaches that focus on one genetic variant or inflammatory biomarker at a time are unlikely to yield satisfactory progress. Moreover, to date, few attempts have been made to identify protective biological components of resilience to frailty. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts who will tackle these barriers by applying state-of-the-art multi-omics approach to test the hypothesis that unique genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiles, which are enriched among families with exceptional longevity, are associated with resilience to frailty. Frailty resilience will be quantified using a newly devised and validated measure, the Frailty Resilience Score (FRS), that incorporates the complex biology of frailty by integrating genetic risk in the form of frailty- specific polygenic risk score (PRS), age, and sex. The FRS will be studied in the context of a multi-omics approach to identify the genomic (Aim 1), epigenomic (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) components that protect from frailty. Whole exome sequencing and SNP arrays will be used to identify gene variants and gene sets associated with frailty resilience (Aim 1). DNA methylation across 850,000 CpG sites will be used for epigenomic discovery (Aim 2) and approximately 5,000 plasma proteins for the proteomic discovery (Aim 3) of resilience markers and pathways. Additionally, integration of proteomics with genomics and epigenomics will be performed to identify common mechanisms and pathways of frailty resilience. These approaches will be applied to a longitudinal cohort of older adults (n=1,400; mean age 76, median follow-up 8 years) from the ongoing LonGenity study, who are annually evaluated with frailty measures, have banked DNA, and whose samples have already been subjected to WES and proteomic analysis. This unique cohort is (1) enriched with protective genes, as half of them are offspring of centenarians and is (2) relatively homogeneous genetically, as all subjects are from an Ashkenazi Jewish founder population, a feature that increases the power for genetic and biological discovery. This multi-omics approach has the potential to both expand our understanding of biology and result in discovery of biomarkers for frailty resilience. Understanding the biologic mechanisms that protect from multi-system failure in older adults is a first step in generating interventions against frailty; while identification of biomarkers will inform us, in the short-term, of the effectiveness of interventions that aim to delay aging and frailty. Project Narrative Frailty is a common clinical condition in older adults that is characterized by increased vulnerability to disability and mortality, and is a major burden for the healthcare system in the United States. Aging is the main risk factor for frailty; however, families of centenarians delay aging and are protected from frailty.

"Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging Project Summary Understanding the biochemical processes underlying aging that give rise to age-related pathologies is the central concept of geroscience research. A focus in geroscience is to identify interventions that slow/prevent aging. These could both alter the trajectory of aging and have beneficial effects across a number of diseases, delaying onset or slowing progression. However, evaluating anti-aging interventions requires years-long studies in mammalian model organisms and is almost impossible in clinical trials that would require of multi-year studies to evaluate lifespan and healthspan extensions. The solution to this problem lies in developing endpoints that indicate biological age and the health-related changes that go with it with sufficient sensitivity. The recent development of epigenetic clocks, chronological age-predictive machine learning models that use DNA cytosine methylation data, are leading the field in age estimation accuracy and precision. The difference between a person’s chronological age and the estimated “methylation age” has been proposed as a measure of aging acceleration or deceleration – a ‘biological age’. Age acceleration predicted by methylation has shown robust correlations to all-cause mortality risk, but weak correlations in age-related diseases. Age-related biological outcomes such as cognitive decline have found little to no association with methylation age acceleration. Put simply, epigenetic clocks have been developed to predict chronological age but have so far demonstrated marginal utility to predict disease states. However, our preliminary results indicate that as many as 20% of genomic cytosines have age-related methylation changes which may be leveraged to understand biological aging and its outcomes simultaneously. Using the largest collection of methylation data with disease, age, tissue, and sex labels from our previous work in natural language processing, we will create the first model of epigenetic aging to identify “healthy” aging loci and disease-predictive loci. These loci will give us insight into the molecular pathways disturbed by age-related methylation changes, providing targets for therapeutic intervention and a predictor for patient disease risk. However, it is still unknown how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’, especially considering their performance across tissues. We will test how epigenetic changes with age are distributed throughout specific cell types in the central nervous system and cell types common across all tissues – such as vascular endothelium and immune cells. Using single-cell bisulfite sequencing and cell-type specific promoter-driven labelling, we can detect if the epigenetic clock changes are truly occurring in all cells or if they are restricted to some cell types common across tissues. This information is critical for predicting the downstream effects of changes identified by epigenetic clocks and interpreting the effects of ‘reversing’ epigenetic aging. These experiments will further our understanding of the role epigenetics play in the aging process and in neurological diseases of age such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Project Narrative Epigenetic clocks, models of DNA methylation changes with age, have been shown as robust biomarkers for aging and all-cause mortality risk, but weakly predict disease risk and thus biological aging. This proposed research plan will generate a new epigenetic model by identifying loci predictive of both age and disease to create an Epigenetic Vulnerability Estimator (EVE), granting insights into disease-associated pathways affected by DNA methylation aging. We will also determine how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’ in the brain using cell-type specific single-cell bisulfite sequencing to understand what cellular populations are reflecting both age-related epigenetic dysregulation and potentially responding to anti-aging interventions.",Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in

"Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults Hypertension affects over 85% of adults over 75 years of age and represents one of the few modifiable risk factors to prevent dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older adults. However, current practice guidelines for hypertension screening and treatment focus heavily on blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained in clinic settings. This reliance on brick-and-mortar offices for BP measurement represents a significant barrier for older adults, who often depend on others for transportation and who are at increased risk of severe morbidity from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) has shown incredible promise for more effective and timely BP treatment and control. Furthermore, the current pandemic has catalyzed widespread adoption of HBPM for hypertension screening and management. However, evidence for this practice is severely lacking in older adults. In fact, there are virtually no HBPM cohort studies in elderly populations in the United States. This is particularly concerning as the discordance between clinic and home BP increases with age, making older adults especially susceptible to harms from either overly aggressive or delayed BP treatment. In this proposed study, we apply our unique expertise with HBPM and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to one of the most long-standing and well-respected American cohorts of community-dwelling adults, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). While ARIC already rigorously measures BP in the clinic setting via automated devices, our proposal will additionally assess 8 days of HBPM and 24 hours of ambulatory BP (once every 20 minutes) in 2,142 racially diverse adults over age 80 years, establishing possibly the largest prospective study of home, ambulatory, and clinic-based BP measurement among older adults in the world. This proposal is designed to directly inform clinical practice with HBPM by characterizing its measurement performance (bias and variance), predictiveness with respect to key long-term events (dementia and CVD), and interpretation (i.e. what a home BP measure equals in terms of BP measured by ABPM or in clinic). The accomplishment of this proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge related to an increasingly utilized form of BP measurement, improving access to timely hypertension care by establishing an efficient protocol for precise BP measurement at home. Moreover, by investing in the digital monitoring platform of the ARIC study, this proposal will lay the foundation for remote collection of a wide range of detailed, longitudinal, biosensor data that can be leveraged by many investigators through subsequent ARIC proposals in years to come. With current trends in BP control worsening among older adults in the United States, there has never been a greater need for research on innovative technologies to improve access to high quality BP measurement. Ultimately, our proposal directly answers the call by NHLBI's 2017 expert panel on BP measurement for high impact research that determines “the role of ABPM and HBPM in the diagnosis…of hypertension” and “the optimal protocol for using HBPM…to diagnose and assess…hypertension.” High blood pressure is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for dementia and cardiovascular disease among older adults in the United States; however, clinic-based blood pressure measurement is inaccessible to many older adults, especially in the COVID-19 era, often delaying hypertension diagnosis and treatment. While home- based blood pressure measures show promise for overcoming access barriers and promoting more timely treatment, there is a dearth of evidence informing the clinical interpretation of these measurements inolder adults in the United States, a population characterized by high blood pressure variability and discordance from clinic- based blood pressure. Our proposal will perform home blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring assessments in over 2,100 community-dwelling adults, aged 80-100 years, establishing the measurement performance, prognostic utility (for dementia and cardiovascular disease), and clinical interpretation of home-based blood pressure measurements in this vulnerable population in the United States.",Prognostic Implications of Home-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring in Older Adults,10273144,R01HL158622,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Joints ', ' Morbidity -

"Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults The overarching goal of this application is to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Technology Collaboratory (AITC) ecosystem that will serve as a national resource to promote the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans. The specific aims are: 1) To engage AI and geriatric/gerontology investigators from across the country and to identify, validate, test, and develop new AI and technologies relevant to improving the health and wellbeing of older adults through crucial pilot study mechanisms; 2) To serve as a national resource center that stimulates and leads the development and implementation of effective novel AI and technology approaches and products that will promote the health, wellbeing and independence of all older Americans; 3) To support the engagement of stakeholders in AI research; 4) To build an ecosystem of overlapping innovation and business, academic, and communities- of-practice networks ; and 5) To provide highest quality expertise, support, and infrastructure needed to disseminate technical and policy guidelines and best practices for effectively incorporating AI approaches and technology for older Americans, in partnership with private industry, angel investors, venture capital firms, and healthcare systems. This AITC is directed by a multi-PI interdisciplinary team led by two world-class experienced investigators who have long worked successfully in the fields of AI and technology development areas partnered with investigators who have long and successfully worked at the translational interface that connects real-world medical, cognitive, and functional declines that impact older adults with medical and technological solutions. Each of these investigators has a complementary skill set and a long track records of organizing transdisciplinary teams and consortiums of investigators around core themes. This interdisciplinary, accomplished, and highly visible leadership team will work together to develop vision for the next generation of AI in aging science and to build a scientifically and culturally diverse community of AI scholars and trainees around Aging. To achieve our goals, we designed the JHU AITC to have robust scientific and technological expertise that are described in eight core components. This infrastructure will support the implementation of stakeholder input and the identification of relevant technologies and investigators locally and nationally through a vetting and feasibility testing process of both technology and data processes. It will include a pilot testing phase and related oversight process. We have also established a key partnership with the Iowa office of Rural Health and Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers Leadership and with organizations within Johns Hopkins University that focus on improvements in the health and well-being of older adults in underserved urban communities. Connections with key academic, industry partners have also been established to accelerate the development of relevant technologies into products. This team is dedicated to developing the next AI scientific advances and disseminating resulting strategies into practice and policy that will maximize health, well-being, and independence for older adults. As the number of older adults increases, many older adults live with conditions that profoundly impact their health, well-being, and ability to maintain independence. Artificial Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to mitigate the impact of aging, to arm health care providers with new tools and to empower older adults including those with Alzheimer’s Dementia and their caregivers. The Johns Hopkins AI and Technology Collaboratory ecosystem will serve as a national resource to promote and guide the development and implementation of novel AI and technology approaches to improve care and health outcomes for older Americans.",Utilizing Technology and AI Approaches to Facilitate Independence and Resilience in Older Adults,10274370,P30AG073104,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', '

"Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da- tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener- ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi- cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments) including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor- hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user- defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re- nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag- ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem- bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma- chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto- ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim 4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im- plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care quality and outcomes for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research infrastructure project will harmonize and merge multiple data sets needed to answer new and complex questions about the aging trajectories and health of diverse populations during the universal process of aging. This project will explore the interactions of shared risk factors across levels (patient, provider, com- munity, health care system, and society) and domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/ built environments) using state-of-the-art analytic methods.

"Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research Project Summary It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well. Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions, site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement. Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging. Project Narrative The goal of this R25 program is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the fields of Biostatistics and quantitative Public Health, with a collaborative focus on the diseases and processes of aging. The program includes an intensive six-week summer program for 12 students, with formal and informal instruction, mentored research, and extensive professional development activities, with a culminating symposium. For lasting impact, follow-up mentoring, continuing research and professional development will occur on a regular basis, both via webcast platforms and return, in-person visits.",Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research,10218054,R25AG067931,"['Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Career Choice ', ' Career Path ', ' career aspiration ', ' career interest ', ' career pathway ', ' career track ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Time ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Community Networks ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Program Reviews ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Site Visit ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' student mentoring ', ' student-led learning ', ' faculty mentor ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' GRE Preparation ', ' GRE Prep ', ' Graduate Record Examination Preparation ', ' informal learning ', ' informal education ', ' informal instruction ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker selection ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R25,2021,371325
"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10188392,R01AG067395,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Floor ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Independent Living ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' signal processing ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,294904
"Mitochondrial health, cardiovascular risk, and blood pressure targets in hypertensive adults PROJECT SUMMARY The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP) targets significantly reduced risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, leading to new guidelines recommending a lower BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. However, intensive BP targets may increase the risk of adverse events from antihypertensive therapy. With widespread adoption of the new BP guidelines, there is an urgent need to evaluate whether there are subgroups of patients who may have an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms from intensive BP lowering. We propose an innovative approach to risk stratification that integrates traditional risk factors with novel information gleaned from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that are essential for energy metabolism and stress adaptation. In animal models, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a fundamental role in aging, CVD, and neurodegenerative diseases. Because mitochondrial metabolism is vital to adapt positively to bioenergetic stressors such as BP lowering, measures of mitochondrial health may help to predict beneficial and adverse outcomes among adults undergoing intensive treatment for hypertension. Recent observational studies have linked novel mtDNA measures with several age-related outcomes, including risks of CVD, hypertension, death, dementia, and reduced functional status. However, the optimal methods for integrating data across the mitochondrial genome have not been established, nor have prior studies investigated the utility of mtDNA measures for identification of subgroups who may derive greatest benefits or harms from intensive BP targets. This proposal will leverage next-gen sequencing technology and machine learning analytics to develop and validate mtDNA risk scores that predict CVD risk, mortality risk, and longitudinal changes in cognitive and physical function in older adults. Our first Aim will implement a biologically-informed neural network among participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC; N=3,075) and the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Study (LIFE; N=1,755) to develop two mtDNA risk scores for prediction of CVD and cognitive and physical function outcomes, while accounting for the competing risk of death. Our second and third Aims will validate these mtDNA risk scores in two landmark trials that evaluated the impact of intensive vs standard BP targets on cardiovascular outcomes: SPRINT (N=9,361) and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD; N=2,488). We will then examine whether mitochondrial risk, assessed by these mtDNA scores, modifies the efficacy or safety of the BP interventions. This work will: 1) develop innovative methods for analysis of mitochondrial genomic data; 2) provide novel hypotheses regarding pathways linking mitochondrial health, CVD risk and functional status; and 3) explore the potential of mtDNA measures for personalized health interventions in older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies found that treating high blood pressure to a lower target reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death, but the benefits and risks of lower blood pressure targets may differ from person to person. These projects will explore whether the health of mitochondria, the structures that convert energy into a form the body can use, affects the benefits or risks of lower blood pressure targets. The knowledge gained will help clinicians to personalize the treatment of high blood pressure, which could reduce the burden of heart disease among millions of individuals worldwide.","Mitochondrial

"Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients’ cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients’ health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application – namely Neuro-World – composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team’s industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system’s ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients’ cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients’ to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients’ compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging. Serious games have received great interests from researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can complement the conventional therapeutic programs to help assess and rehabilitate patients' functional impairments in many environments (e.g., clinics, long-term care facilities, patients' homes). In this project, we propose to develop a human-centered mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the self-administrate serious game-based training in patients with MCI outside the clinic.",Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,10190616,R21AG071988,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Video Games ', ' videogame ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' Single-blind ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' psychological distress ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver training ', ' caregiver training ', ' caregiver education ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' cognitive training ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' chronic stroke ', ' usability ', ' normal aging ', ' prototype ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Regimen ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' cognitive performance ', ' clinical investigation ', ' personalized management ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' stroke survivor ', ' translational impact ', ' recruit ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' side effect ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2021,436836
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Humidity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Nursing Records ', ' Oregon ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' pressure ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' analytical method ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' barometric pressure ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' caregiver strain ', ' care giver strain ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' dementia care ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' intervention cost ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' deep learning ', ' aging and technology ', ' risk prediction model ', ' side effect ', ' motion sensor ', ' memory care ', ' poor sleep ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437
"Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes Blood-based biomarkers have been widely used in studying various metabolic pathways contributing to aging, including energy metabolism, chronic inflammation, cellular senescence, and endothelial function. Like blood- derived biomarkers, imaging-based biomarkers can be evaluated as potential predictors of aging outcomes. For study of non-neurologic aging, biomarkers derived from computed tomography (CT) offer great promise. Recent advances in scanner technology and image processing mean that most CT examinations can be obtained in less than one minute, lowering participant burden. In addition, radiation doses have been lowered and the intra- and inter-scanner variability has improved. In parallel, machine learning tools allow for automated image processing and segmentation, increasing efficiency of image analysis, and reducing bias. For these reasons, CT is increasingly being used to study skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. On CT, muscle quantity is typically measured by cross-sectional area (CSA). Muscle quality is traditionally quantified by skeletal muscle density (SMD) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) cross-sectional area. In addition to being a measure of muscle quality, IMAT may be considered as a measure of fat quantity. We recently developed and validated an automated machine learning tool to determine traditional CT measures of muscle and adipose tissue quantity and quality. To better characterize tissue quality, we have also applied ""radiomic"" texture analysis to muscle tissue on CT images. Texture analysis refers to the quantification of image voxel inter-relationships and provides a measure of tissue heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this technique has never been applied to CT images from community-based epidemiological studies. We propose to relate these CT-based assessments of muscle and adipose tissues to important geriatric outcomes, focusing on hip and other fractures as well as falls, physical performance, and strength. We will complete these analyses on archived CT images in MrOS (a prospective cohort study of healthy aging in older men, with a particular focus on osteoporosis) and Health ABC (a prospective cohort study of non-disabled Black and White older adults). Abdominal CT images were collected at the baseline exam for MrOS men in the United States (N~3700 in 2000-2), MrOS men in Hong Kong (N~400 in 2001-3), and Health ABC (N~3000 in 1997-8). Health ABC also collected CT images at the mid-thigh. In Health ABC, mid-thigh and abdominal CT images were repeated in a subset five years later (N~600 in 2000-3). We will add three aims: 1) test the hypothesis that that greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with increased risk of hip and other fractures, 2) test the hypothesis greater muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the abdomen and mid-thigh are associated with lower strength and poor physical performance (walking speed and chair stands); their decline over time; and risk of falls, and 3) characterize changes in muscle and fat tissue heterogeneity features at the mid-thigh over 6 years. In this secondary data analysis project, we proposed to measure muscle and adipose tissue quality and quality with automated, machine learning algorithms on existing CT images previously collected as part of the MrOS and Health ABC studies. Further, we will derive novel, radiomic based measures of texture of muscle and adipose tissue, and relate all of these metrics to important adverse geriatric outcomes in older adults.",Novel Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging Biomarkers in Older Adults for Predicting Adverse Geriatric Health Outcomes,10303313,R21AG070804,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Archives ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Endothelium ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hong Kong ', ' Hongkong ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' skeletal ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' fall risk ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' older men ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' abdominal CT ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Physical Performance ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' radiomics ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R21,2021,213676
"Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the ubiquitous role of fibrosis in tissue dysfunction arising from aging and disease, no representative in vitro model of the fibrotic microenvironment exists. Fibrosis is characterized by excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition that stiffens the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, to model fibrosis in vitro, cell culture substrates that permit quantitative, dynamic tuning of matrix mechanics and composition are necessary. However, existing dynamic hydrogel culture platforms generally rely on chemistries that may be toxic to cells or that simultaneously change multiple parameters, making it difficult to assign causal relationships between altered matrix properties and cell fate changes. Fibrotic stiffening occurs in a wide range of tissues, including skeletal muscle. Along with increased fibrosis, the regenerative function of skeletal muscle decreases with aging. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are responsible for maintaining and repairing muscle throughout life and are known to be acutely mechanosensitive, losing their stem cell potential when cultured on stiff substrates. Thus, the stiffened, fibrotic microenvironment may contribute to the diminished regenerative capacity of aged MuSCs. The goal of this project is to develop an in vitro model of tissue fibrosis based on dynamic hydrogel biomaterials and to employ this model to identify molecular mechanisms of MuSC mechanosensing that are implicated in MuSC dysfunction in aging. The mentored phase of this proposal will provide advanced technical training in aging biology, transgenic mouse models, cellular traction force measurement, and machine learning approaches for bioinformatics. This training will enable an independent research program leveraging dynamic biomaterials to deconvolve the complex interactions of mechanical forces, matrix biochemistry, and cell-cell signaling that dictate the progression of aging and disease. Additional structured training in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and research management will facilitate the transition to independence, supported by a committee of faculty from the Stanford Schools of Medicine and Engineering.  Aim 1 will optimize a synthetic hydrogel system that uses near-infrared light and bioorthogonal reactions to dynamically stiffen the gels, mimicking fibrosis. These hydrogels will be used to elucidate mechanisms of mechanosensing in MuSCs, using FRET-based force sensors and transgenic mouse models. Aim 2 will model muscle aging in vitro, using dynamically stiffening gels modified with ECM components characteristic of aging. Single cell RNA sequencing and machine learning bioinformatics approaches will identify unique mechanically regulated drivers of cell fate that reduce MuSC regenerative potential in aging. Aim 3 will develop novel materials for 3D cell culture with dynamic tuning of viscoelastic properties to establish the first human model of muscle “aging in a dish.” This project stands to identify new therapeutic targets to improve muscle function with aging and to develop engineered platforms to study numerous heritable diseases and aging in diverse tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fibrosis, which causes dysfunction and ultimate failure of numerous tissues with aging, is characterized in part by increased tissue stiffness. Despite the profound impact of fibrosis on the health of our aging population, no adequate model system exists to study fibrotic stiffening on individual cells in real-time. This project aims to develop a dynamic material platform that enables user-directed manipulation of stiffness and to apply this system to identify aging-related changes in muscle stem cells that could lead to novel therapies to improve muscle function in aged individuals.",Elucidating Effects of Fibrosis on Aged Stem Cells with Dynamic Biomaterials,10299996,K99AG071738,"['Adhesives ', ' Aging ', '

"Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Accelerated Brain Aging in World Trade Center Responders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The men and women who worked in rescue and recovery operations at the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) site are developing cognitive impairment at mid-life, decades before age-based cognitive impairment is usually detected. To date, one of the most consistent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and impairment in this population include long-term exposures to the WTC disaster sites and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our preliminary analyses identified reduced cortical thickness in responders with dementia compared to cognitively unimpaired WTC responders. While this work has been valuable in advancing our understanding of cognitive impairment in WTC responders, it remains unknown to what extent reduced cortical thickness is indicative of a known disorder, and no studies to date have been able to reliably quantify the extent to which patterns evident on MRI match population norms. Our team has recently identified a highly sensitive biomarker for functional “brain age,” which we have shown to detect the first signs of deterioration as early as the late 40’s. Known as brain “network stability,” this measure replicates across multiple large-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and correlates with gradual cognitive decline. The difference between an individual’s predicted age based on MRI data (“brain age”) versus their chronological age provides a metric for accelerated brain aging. Therefore, a critical next step is to characterize WTC responders’ brain ages, both structurally (cortical thickness) and functionally (network stability), which may relate WTC trauma to observed cognitive impairment at mid-life. In the present work, we propose to complete secondary data analyses of a large-scale brain MRI training data set (UK Biobank, N=19,831) to train a deep learning model for neurobiological signatures of aging and its potential mechanisms. We will then compare neurobiological features seen in WTC responders to these signatures. In Aim 1, we measure accelerated brain aging for WTC responders with and without PTSD, using comparing brain aging to population norms, as well as to proteomic markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, including β-amyloid and tau. In Aim 2, we leverage our previous methods development in AI of neuroimaging data to develop neurobiological classifiers specific to key mechanisms of relevance to WTC: particulates, glucocorticoids, inflammation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, to determine whether AI classifies WTC brains as matching neurobiological signatures specific to one or more of these mechanisms. This study responds to a call for aging-related research proposals in WTC-affected individuals (RFA-OH-21-004) and will improve our understanding of accelerated neurobiological aging in an existing neuroimaging study of WTC responders. For the prevention of ADRD to be successful, reliable measures are needed for subclinical changes in accelerated brain aging that occur in midlife. This study seeks to implement a novel measure of brain age optimized to be sensitive to midlife neurological changes and combines it with AI to identify the mechanisms through which exposures may have affected WTC responders.

"Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) is now a public health crisis. In the absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have shown promise, but additional innovative approaches that could be highly accessible by capitalizing on user- friendly digital applications to support and strengthen behavior modification are needed. Training in the use of compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These same compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain health (e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting, behavioral monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that provides training in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools encapsulated in the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to facilitate behavioral change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-time data to track intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for building resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but who remain cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially diverse older adults with SCC to compare our digital app supported compensation training and lifestyle modification intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with guidance on how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project include: 1) evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function); secondary outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of daily living (IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of treatment responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention using a mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in real-time DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status. The intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle modifications and everyday functioning using a digital app that also monitors adherence to each component of the intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that may impact adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable intervention to reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that will delay functional disability and improve the quality of life of our growing aging population. This work is expected to lead to a scalable compensation and lifestyle intervention to improve well-being and delay disability in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. This research is relevant to public health and NIH's mission as the results are expected to have an important positive impact on caregiver burden, health care costs and the functional independence of

"Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary/Abstract  This is a Beeson (K76) career development award for Sachin J Shah, MD, MPH, a physician-investigator trained in internal medicine, clinical epidemiology, and aging research. Dr. Shah is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Shah's long-term goal is to build evidence to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults facing high-risk, high-benefit therapeutic decisions using new epidemiologic methods and geriatric research principles. The decision to use anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) is the paradigm of a high-stakes therapeutic decision because while anticoagulants prevent stroke, they increase the risk of bleeding complications. Guidelines use a one-size-fits-all approach; for older adults, they recommend near-universal anticoagulant use. In numerous studies of clinical practice, physicians report concern with the current approach voicing the need to individualize treatment recommendations for older adults. This proposal addresses the pressing need to individualize anticoagulant treatment decisions in older adults with AF through two aims. Aim 1: Develop and validate individualized estimates of the treatment effect of anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in older adults with AF. This aim will use clinical trial and observational data to develop and validate a treatment effect model that will estimate individual-level treatment benefit. Aim 2: Ascertain functional outcomes after major extracranial hemorrhage, both short-term and longer-term. The functional outcomes following major hemorrhage, a key adverse event of anticoagulant therapy, are unclear, especially in older adults. Through two studies, this proposal will determine the short- and long-term functional outcomes following major hemorrhage.  Dr. Shah's exceptional, multidisciplinary mentoring team is led by Dr. Margaret Fang, nationally recognized for her work studying the clinical outcomes of anticoagulants in older adults and co-mentored by Dr. Kenneth Covinsky, whose nationally recognized research program has advanced our understanding of the predictors and outcomes of disability in older adults. This career development award will support Dr. Shah's transition to research independence through mentorship and focused training in (1) measuring heterogeneous treatment effects using novel epidemiologic tools, (2) primary data collection to build prospective cohorts of older adults, (3) designing decision aids and (4) leadership development to lead cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional research teams. This proposal will support a development grant to design and pilot a clinical decision tool for older adults considering anticoagulant and a project grant to measure heterogeneous treatment effects of procedural interventions in older adults with AF. The proposed research and training aims will provide Dr. Shah with the data, training, and experience to support competitive R-series applications. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder in older adults, and it substantially increases the risk of disabling strokes. Anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of stroke but increases the likelihood of disabling bleeding events. We lack a way to individualize treatment decisions for older adults—this proposal will use multiple studies to better define the individual risk and benefits of anticoagulants in older adults with atrial fibrillation.",Individualizing Anticoagulant use in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation,10339189,K76AG074919,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cryosurgery ', ' Cryoablation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' forest ', ' Anticoagulant therapy ', ' Anticoagulant Chemotherapy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' heart rhythm ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' investigator training ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' leadership development ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' side effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K76,2021,243000
"Development of a Digital Cognitive Screening Test to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Clinical Settings. Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a growing health problem in our aging population. Assessment of cognitive functioning for early detection is critical to identify individuals who might benefit from treatment with the available symptomatic medications for mild dementia as well as future disease-modifying therapies that are actively under development and being tested in clinical research trials. Current cognitive screening tools are time-consuming and not routinely used or documented in busy primary care settings. As a result, we need easily accessible tools, such as patient self-administered measures, to screen individuals in primary care settings to guide counseling, referrals, and interventions. The proposed STTR Phase I project aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, RIMCAT (Rhode Island Mobile Cognitive Assessment Tool) to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. RIMCAT consists of 10 components and was designed for self-administration in supervised settings such as primary care practices and provides a cognitive-friendly interface allowing voice inputs, keyboard typing, and easy-to-understand instructions. The goal of this STTR project is to examine the initial reliability and validity of RIMCAT through a psychometric study. The project also includes the development of a digital health framework to support the workflow of MCI/dementia screening. This work will establish the usability of RIMCAT among older adults who could undergo the screening assessment on a digital platform, regardless of their ability to use modern mobile technologies. Project Narrative This STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop and test an innovative digital cognitive screening instrument, to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. We will conduct a feasibility study to measure the initial reliability and validity of the instrument on 30 cognitively healthy older adults and 30 with cognitive impairment. We will develop a digital health framework to support the administration and scoring of RIMCAT in the current workflow.

"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. Falls are a significant public health issue for older adults and critical for seniors in low income settings; therefore, the study is highly relevant to public health.",Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults,10264032,R03AG069793,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Gait ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Craniocerebral Trauma ', ' Craniocerebral Injuries ', ' Head Injuries ', ' Head Trauma ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Housing ', ' Human Activities ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Privacy ', ' falls ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Monitor ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' improved functioning ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive ability ', ' data visualization ', ' fall injury ', ' fall related injury ', ' injurious falls ', ' Gait speed ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' dashboard ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social vulnerability ', ' motion sensor ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2021,81230
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10260623,K99AG068544,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Glutamine ', ' Gln ', ' L-Glutamine ', ' Q Levoglutamide ', ' Q.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,10234145,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' immune health ', ' immune system health ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' NGS data ', ' informatics tool ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2021,464920
"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Immunology in

"Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias Project Summary/Abstract Currently, in the United States, there are 5.8 million older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Twenty-one percent of older adults with AD/ADRD have unplanned, and often preventable, hospital readmissions within 30-days, which are estimated to cost over $5.4 billion per year. The development of clinical data research networks (CDRN) and their large complex datasets including patient and clinical level data have led to the development of various models to predict readmissions. However, the existing models have not demonstrated adequate predictive capability. The opportunity to integrate nursing care plan (i.e., patient problems, goals, and interventions) to these large datasets can fill gaps and improve the accuracy of prediction models. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the integration of nursing care plan data to CDRN datasets is therefore critical for understanding and improving interdisciplinary care aimed at reducing readmissions of older adults with AD/ADRD. In this project, we propose to expand the research infrastructure of the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium and Data Trust through the creation, for the first time, of a reusable and feasible data pipeline that will ultimately integrate key care plan data elements documented by nurses into the OneFlorida Data Trust. The long-term goal of our research program is to gain a deeper understanding of readmissions for the aging population with AD/ADRD through the availability of an expanded dataset with interdisciplinary data. We plan to carry out the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Develop and test a prototype pipeline for extracting, translating, and integrating problems and goals in nursing care plan data from the University of Florida (UF Health) into the statewide OneFlorida Data Trust. We will map the local vocabulary used to represent the two nursing data elements to nationally recognized terminology sets using natural language processing and have registered nurses validate the mapping results. We will then use automated scripts to replace the local vocabulary with the standardized terms and integrate the data into the Trust. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Convert and integrate into the Trust nursing interventions from UF Health. Specific Aim 3 (R33 Phase): Extract, convert, and integrate to the Trust nursing data from a second organization, using the pipeline from the R21 phase. Specific Aim 4 (R33 Phase): Construct and test readmissions prediction models for older adults (aged 65 and above) with AD/ADRD using pertinent variables from the Trust and environmental dataset linked to it. We will develop machine-learning models for predicting readmissions from the nursing care elements, other patient- level data in the Trust, and important environmental variables that influence post-discharge follow-up care. Our team will be among the first to develop sustainable data pipelines for transforming local nursing care plan data into standardized data for integration into a large dataset. Through this study, we will learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions. Project Narrative We will expand a research infrastructure to support the integration of nursing care plan data to large complex datasets with patient and clinical level data. Through this expanded research infrastructure, we will be able to create predictive models with nursing, clinical, and environmental data for unplanned readmissions of older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias. We are confident that this study will be a model for the development of new research-data infrastructure and will allow us to learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions.",Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias,10204503,R21AG072265,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Care Plans ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Readmission ', ' patient re-admission ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Ache ', ' Trust ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' age group ', ' nursing intervention ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' R.N.

"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Awareness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Medication Errors ', ' medication administration errors ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Management ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' patient home care ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Home Health Care Agencies ', ' home healthcare agencies ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' Medicare claim ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' study population ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' unstructured data ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot

"Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall More than 90% of older Americans would prefer to stay in their homes as long as possible as they age. However, the prevalence of chronic illness including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) can make the goal of successful aging at home out of reach without substantial support. At- home health care technologies hold significant promise to provide many needed forms of support, but have not been specifically developed for older adults, AD/ADRD patients, caregivers, and their clinicians. Many existing health monitoring technologies are burdensome to use for older adults, are not sufficiently accurate, have specific algorithmic biases, and lack adequate usability, and the resulting deluge of data often fails to provide information that can usefully inform caregivers and support clinical decisions. Further, many current treatment and intervention regimes are limited in terms of their ability to be remotely delivered, managed and adapted to patient needs and caregiver abilities over time. The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) is a multidisciplinary Center spanning five sites – the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brandeis University and Northeastern University – that aims to foster interdisciplinary research on the development, validation and translation of emerging AI- enhanced technologies to enhance connections between older adults, caregivers, and clinicians in order to more effectively support healthy aging as well as the care of patients with AD/ADRD at home. To achieve this objective, MAITC will pursue the five aims. The first is to apply a rigorous process which involves eliciting stakeholder needs to drive the foci of pilot studies and identifying promising technologies suitable for incorporation into pilot research projects. The second is to form and support a multidisciplinary community of engineers, computer scientists, behavioral scientists, medical researchers, nurses and clinicians working to advance the goals of the MAITC. The third is to provide access to state-of-art validation facilities, diverse cohorts across rural and urban areas, and translation and commercialization services to enable rapid, robust and multi-faceted validation and translation of AI-enhanced technologies. The fourth is to administer a pilot project granting process and ensure that the pilot projects are responsive to stakeholder needs, use emerging AI and related technologies that have significant potential to improve interactions between older adults, lay caregivers, and clinicians. The fifth is to provide training to developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders and to disseminate findings to diverse research, development and practice communities to accelerate further development of promising technologies and promote the adoption of validated technologies beyond the MAITC. Through these coordinated efforts, we hope to improve the lives of older adults and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease (MAITC) seeks to develop and validate health monitoring devices and artificial intelligence technologies to support healthy aging and Alzheimer's Disease care.

"T cells in the aging brain SUMMARY The overarching goal of this project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’. However, recent studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, and could this knowledge be used to restore functionality of old brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases?  The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain provides a great paradigm to address this question, as this regenerative region of the brain contains many different cell types – neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial cells, microglia – and exhibits clear functional decline during aging. To gain a single cell understanding of the changes that occur with age in neurogenic niches, we recently performed single cell RNA-sequencing of young and old neurogenic niches in mice. This analysis revealed a striking infiltration of cytotoxic T cells only in the old neurogenic niche, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from old SVZs are clonally expanded and secrete interferon g (IFNg), suggesting that they have encountered specific antigens. We also showed that T cells can impair NSC proliferation both in co-cultures and in vivo. Based on these data, our specific hypothesis is that T cell clonal expansion in old brains drives the deterioration of the neurogenic niche with age, and that preventing this T cell expansion restores function to old neurogenic regions. Probing this idea would be critical to counter the decline in brain function during aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following experiments: 1. To determine how T cells infiltrate neurogenic niches in old individuals; 2. To understand the functional impact of T cells on old neurogenic niches; 3. To examine the interaction between immune cells and neurogenic niches in young, old, and rejuvenated individuals.  Completion of these aims will provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of T cell and other immune cells during aging in regenerative niches of the brain. This work should also give a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic impact of the interferon response and T cell cytotoxicity on different cell types in the brain. Knowledge from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including new immunotherapies, for the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain function during aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE As the organism ages, adult regenerative neural stem cell niches no longer produce new neurons. Adult neurogenic niches have been found to be important for aspects of learning and memory, raising the intriguing possibility that boosting the production of neurons by these niches may help preserve or enhance cognitive function with advancing age. Uncovering the immune-based mechanisms underlying the decline and rejuvenation of adult neurogenic niches during aging should give important insights into the factors that control regeneration in the normal aging nervous system as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",T cells in the aging brain,10184422,R01AG071711,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Rejuvenation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes ', ' Cell-Mediated Lympholytic Cells ', ' Cytolytic T-Cell ', ' Cytotoxic T Cell ', ' killer T cell ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Microglia ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' Evaluation ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Infiltration ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' exhaustion ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' T-cell depletion therapy ', ' T-lymphocyte depletion therapy ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment.

Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,10174657,R01AG057679,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Transitions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urbanization ', ' War ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' parallel processing ', ' intergenerational ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' health economics ', ' data integration ', ' lead exposure ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' economic outcome ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Social Processes ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,672964
"Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study ABSTRACT There is a pressing need for effective interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter the trajectory toward Alzheimer’s disease. The NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III Augmenting Cognitive Training in Older Adults (ACT) trial aimed to demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive training could achieve this goal. The present study proposes a state of the art secondary data analysis of ACT trial data that will further this aim by 1) elucidate mechanism of action underlying response to tDCS treatment with CT, 2) address heterogeneity of response in tDCS augmented CT by determining how individual variation in the dose of electrical current delivered to the brain interacts with individual brain anatomical characteristics; and 3) refine the intervention strategy of tDCS paired with CT by evaluating methods for precision delivery targeted dosing characteristics to facilitate tDCS augmented outcomes. tDCS intervention to date, including ACT, apply a fixed dosing approach whereby a single stimulation intensity (e.g., 2mA) and set of electrode positions on the scalp (e.g., F3/F4) is applied to all participants/patients. However, our recent work has demonstrated that age-related changes in neuroanatomy as well as individual variability in head/brain structures (e.g., skull thickness) significantly impacts the distribution and intensity of electrical current induced in the brain from tDCS. This project will use person-specific MRI-derived finite element computational models of electric current characteristics (current intensity and direction of current flow) and new methods for enhancing the precision and accuracy of derived models to precisely quantify the heterogeneity of current delivery in older adults. We will leverage these individualized precision models with state-of-the-art support vector machine learning methods to determine the relationship between current characteristics and treatment response to tDCS and CT. We will leverage the inherent heterogeneity of neuroanatomy and fixed current delivery to provide insight in the not only which dosing parameters were associated with treatment response, but also brain region specific information to facilitate targeted delivery of stimulation in future trials. Further still, the current study will also pioneer new methods for calculation of precision dosing parameters for tDCS delivery to potentially optimize treatment response, as well as identify clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with response to tDCS and CT in older adults. Leveraging a robust and comprehensive behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging data set for ACT with advanced computational methods, the proposed study will provide critical information for mechanism, heterogeneity of treatment response and a pathway to refined precision dosing approaches for remediating age- related cognitive decline and altering the trajectory of older adults toward Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE This secondary data analysis leverages data from an Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III randomized clinical trial examining benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation paired with cognitive training to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter trajectories toward Alzheimer’s disease. Using advanced neuroimaging-derived computational modeling and artificial intelligence-based machine learning methods, the study will determine the mechanisms underlying response vs. non-response to treatment in older adults and precision dosing parameters for optimizing treatment outcomes.","Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented

"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Choroid ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cytoplasmic Granules ', ' granule ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipofuscin ', ' Maps ', ' Melanins ', ' Methods ', ' Ophthalmoscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Risk ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruchs membrane ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' retinal rods ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' rod cell ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Primate Diseases ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Retinal Photoreceptors ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' fluorophore ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Therapy Evaluation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' early onset ', ' restorative treatment ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' neurovascular unit ', ' neuro-vascular unit ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' Prevalence ', ' normal aging ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' adaptive optics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' healthy aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' imaging platform ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Americas ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Medication Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Coin ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Anti-diabetic Agents ', ' Antidiabetic Agents ', ' anti-diabetic ', ' anti-diabetic drugs ', ' antidiabetic ', ' Antidiabetic Drugs ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' longterm care nursing ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' diabetic patient ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' adverse event risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375
"Detecting Medical Emergencies in Isolated Older Adults Living Alone in Rural Areas Abstract Isolated older persons living alone in a rural house are at risk of being in medical distress without help. A rural house can be isolated from neighbors who can easily check on their well-being. As these people become elderly, they can have a high preference to stay in their home as long they believe they can care for themselves. An elderly person alone and in distress can be in a life and death situation in an isolated rural home. In an isolated rural house, many days can pass before someone decides to drive to their location to check on the elderly person. This project develops a low-cost monitoring solution for isolated rural elderly to safely lead independent lives. The phase I SBIR project will develop a wireless indoor tracking system to detect a person's location through several walls of a typical rural house. There will be no cables to run or need to install a complex array of sensors through the house. The cost of installation inexpensive. The system will have battery backup and protocols to operate over long power outages. It will also have a cell phone backup communication option should phone lines be down. The system will identify motions of the elderly person 24 hours a day in the house. Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms can detect abnormalities from their daily routine. The product is intended to be an optional accessory to in-home alert systems in use today and work with multiple vendors of in-home alert systems. It will operate in parallel with wearable buttons to signal an alert. Once the system identifies a distress event has occurred it will activate the alert system the same way as a wearable button press. The same alert protocol would be followed. In these systems an operator would first try to talk to the person with a speaker phone of the vendors' in-home alert system. If they cannot communicate with the person, they start working through a call list of local people to check on the home. The phase I will develop and test the wireless indoor tracking system and the Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. Project Narrative Of the 60 million people living in rural United States, 15% are aged 65 years or older. People aged 70 and older constitute 13% of the population, but account for 20% of hospital treated falls and 70% of deaths.

The IASDR hosted and maintained by the OAIC’s Coordinating Center (CC). As a domain-specific repository, the existing IASDR contains multiple data sets generated from aging studies conducted at the Wake Forest OAIC (WF-OAIC), as well as a biospecimen bank for samples collected from some of the included studies. The IASDR thus serves as a valuable resource for the aging research community, especially for early career faculty. The data repository befits early career investigators who want to conduct small pilot studies for testing out conjectures and research hypotheses, and to efficiently produce useful information such as preliminary effect sizes for grant applications or to power future studies. Gaps were identified when the IASDR was evaluated against modern repository requirements. The IASDR was first started more than a decade ago, and the development process did not necessarily strictly adhere to contemporary biomedical-data repository principles such as the FAIR and TRUST principles. Importantly, barriers are present for users in accessing key information for decision support. For example, currently summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency for variables and association information between variables, which are often critical in helping users to decide whether or not to pursue actual data, are not present in the IASDR metadata. The lack of such preliminary information could deter interested users from using the repository. To address gaps and limitations of the IASDR as related to its “FAIR”-ness and “TRUST”- worthiness, this proposal contains two specific aims: (1) Enhance the metadata layer by providing users with key analytic information such as mean, frequency, and association between variables, and (2) improve the IASDR along the FAIR and TRUST principles and seek certification. Project Narrative The proposed project improves an existing data repository, the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR), which contains both data and biospecimen from multiple aging studies, along principles for modern data repository. The improvement will increase usability and confidence of the aging research user community.",Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry,10408207,U24AG059624,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen bank ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Licensing ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' computer center ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' Structure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' study characteristics ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' data sharing ', ' early-career faculty ', ' data access ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' TRUST principles ', ' Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2021,232275
"Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY  The capacity for muscle regeneration decreases markedly with aging. While regeneration is led by muscle stem cells (MuSC), complex age-related changes in the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) provide potent signals that drive aberrant lineage specification. The complexity of the interactions between aging MuSC and their environmental niche defined by biomechanical, architectural, and dynamic changes in the ECM suggests a data-driven analysis can elucidate underlying mechanisms, increase our fundamental understanding of aging and stem cell biology, and point to novel therapeutic strategies. In this research, -omics data (i.e., single cell RNA-seq and imaging flow cytometry assessments of myogenic markers) obtained from cells cultured onto substrates of varying elasticity and cell-adhesion will be used to probe signaling pathways including mitochondrial/metabolic signaling pathways in cultured MuSCs. We propose that the implementation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) paradigms represents a critical next step for integrating multi- layer -omics datasets and building predictive models that will more comprehensively elucidate stem cell responses to the extrinsic biophysical environment.  The overarching goal of this Supplement is to test the central hypothesis that Biological data and domain knowledge relating to muscle aging can be embedded in a framework of Bayesian optimization will allow for elucidating mechanisms and accurately predicting regenerative responses. This central hypothesis will be tested by conducting three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To prepare -omics data for ML models: Curate datasets, identify and impute missing data, compile metadata, and pre-process data to quantify descriptors used in model building. Adopt data management protocols associated with best practices. Specific Aim 2. To perform benchmark ML modeling with Bayesian optimization: Identify environmental variables (ECM stiffness and composition, signaling molecules) and cellular characteristics (age, expression markers) that correlate with epigenetic signatures and myogenicity, then develop mechanistic ML models and estimate posterior distributions. Specific Aim 3. To broaden approaches to ML modeling and broaden researcher engagement in the biology of aging: CMU will host a hackathon with teams that combine students and researchers from regional universities and HBCU partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly individuals, muscle injury often results in dramatic functional declines, with these declines being largely a result of an impaired regenerative response. The focus of the parent grant is to investigate how age- related changes in the biophysical skeletal muscle microenvironment contribute to an impaired muscle stem cell function and defective healing after an acute injury. In this Administrative Supplement, we will extend the aims of this project by developing machine learning/artificial intelligence models that estimate biological age of muscle stem cells and predict regenerative potential.",Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration,10410777,R01AG061005,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Elasticity ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Descriptor ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' data management ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Impairment ', ' parent grant ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' stem cell biology ', ' muscle aging ', ' aged muscle ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Regenerative response ', ' regeneration response ', ' model building ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' regeneration potential ', ' regenerative potential ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,281359
"Diversity Candidate Research Supplement to Study Human Cell Models of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment. We currently do not have a full understanding of this “heterogeneity” and how it contributes to overall human aging or the enhanced risk of diseases with age.

"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction. Upon completion of the proposes studies, we will have further expanded our understanding of SIRT1 biology allowing for refined approaches to activate SIRT1 to promote healthy aging. NARRATIVE The proposed studies will advance our understanding into the underlying biology linking dietary factors to healthspan. The data gleaned from these studies will help refine therapeutic or nutritional avenues to modulate lifespan and aging-related diseases resulting in a direct, positive impact on human health.",MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan,10263268,R01AG069768,"['Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Monounsaturated Fatty Acids ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipolysis ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Oils ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Olive oil preparation ', ' Olive Oil ', ' polyphenol ', ' Resveratrol ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' PPAR alpha ', ' PPAR-α ', ' PPARalpha ', ' PPARα ', ' Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha ', ' Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' red wine ', ' Olives ', ' Olives - dietary ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' deacylation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Catabolism ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' caloric restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorie restriction ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' Silent Mating Type Information Regulator 2-like Proteins ', ' Sir2-like Proteins ', ' Sirtuins ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' nutrient sensing ', ' perception of nutrients ', ' detection of nutrient ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1 ', ' FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1 ', ' FRAP1 ', ' FRAP2 ', ' Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin ', ' RAFT1 ', ' mTOR ', ' mammalian target of rapamycin ', ' FRAP1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Deacetylation ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' mutant mouse model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' healthy aging ', ' nutrient deprivation ', ' nutritional deprivation ', ' SIRT1 gene ', ' SIRT1 ', ' Sirtuin 1 ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,317579
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10263175,R01AG065288,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Woman ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' Mediating ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medial ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Premenopause ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Failure ', ' Bladder Dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' age group ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' Micturition Reflex ', ' voiding reflex ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,612748
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10267717,R01AG065218,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' iterative design ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Analytics ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,603938
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment. We currently do not have a full understanding of this “heterogeneity” and how it contributes to overall human aging or the enhanced risk of diseases with age.

"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10238835,R61AG068926,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exercise ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Rural ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' clinically actionable ', ' exercise prescription ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' fall injury ', ' fall related injury ', ' injurious falls ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' implementation protocol ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2021,243761
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,10179293,R01AG064233,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ', ' ALS and FTD ', ' ALS and FTLD ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia ', ' FTD/ALS ', ' FTLD-ALS ', ' amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ', ' amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ftd ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", ' non-demented ', ' nondemented ', ' recruit ', ' pathology imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' religious order study ', ' ']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,663226
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,10102161,R01AG062713,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Cardiovascular Agents ', ' Cardiovascular Drugs ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enalapril ', ' Enacard ', ' Renitec ', ' Renitek ', ' Vasotec ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' indexing ', ' Neprilysin ', ' CD10 Antigens ', ' Enkephalinase ', ' Membrane Metalloendopeptidase ', ' Neutral Endopeptidase ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Warfarin ', ' Work ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' head-to-head comparison ', ' head-to-head analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723192
"ENIGMA World Aging Center ABSTRACT One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another dementia - diseases that cost the nation $259 billion, to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2017). Despite the vast personal and economic cost of these diseases, two major barriers stall efforts to discover key biological mechanisms that influence brain aging. First, the sheer cost of data collection means that most national initiatives have limited power to detect factors that affect brain aging. Even in datasets of N=1,000+ people (e.g., ADNI) – the power to discover modulators of brain aging is limited and may not generalize worldwide. Second, with the crisis of reproducibility, we do not always know if a finding will replicate; and if not, if this is due to true population heterogeneity or problems with methods. ENIGMA offers a coordinated global approach to solve these problems. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a global brain aging study that builds on our vast and highly productive ENIGMA consortium - a global network of 340 institutions in 45 countries. ENIGMA published the largest-ever genetic studies of the brain (Nature 2017; Science 2020), and the largest neuroimaging studies of 5 major psychiatric disorders. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a concerted global effort to pool all available data, methods, expertise and capital infrastructure to discover factors that affect brain aging. Our long-term goal is to identify personalized biological predictors of brain structural and functional decline and assess how they generalize globally. We have 4 aims: Aim 1: ENIGMA-Lifespan. Develop Lifespan Charts for Brain and Neural Tract Aging in 20,000 people. We will create charts showing how MRI brain measures change throughout life in 20,000 people, aged 1-92. We will compute a composite brain aging score, `Brain Age', from available MRI, DTI, rsFMRI data, that measures how much the brain deviates from expected values, for a person's age and sex. Aim 2: ENIGMA-Epigenetics. Relate genome-wide methylation levels to brain metrics in 10,000+ people, to discover epigenetic markers of accelerated brain aging. We discovered 2 epigenetic loci promoting brain aging in pilot studies. We will compute a “epigenetic clock” and test if it predicts brain metrics better than simple biological age. Aim 3: ENIGMA-Plasticity. Discover genomic loci that promote or mitigate brain tissue loss, in > 37 worldwide cohorts with longitudinal MRI. Aim 4: ENIGMA-Alzheimer's Disease (New Aim). Meta-analyze the role of APOE, AD polygenic risk, and a new risk score for accelerated atrophy on neuroimaging biomarkers in aging and AD, including amyloid and FDG PET. These aims seek to analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods. We aim to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and epigenome, test how and when they shift AD biomarkers, and test their generalizability worldwide. NARRATIVE To address reproducibility and power issues in aging and Alzheimer's disease research, we launch ENIGMA's World Aging Center, a global brain study of aging and AD across 45 countries. Leveraging our ENIGMA network (340 institutions), we launch 4 coordinated projects to empower genetic and epigenetic studies of brain aging: (1) Enigma-Lifespan- creates normative charts of brain aging metrics from MRI, diffusion imaging, and functional MRI in 20,000 people worldwide; (2) ENIGMA-Epigenetics- relates genome-wide methylation to brain aging; (3) ENIGMA-Plasticity- seeking genetic loci affecting brain atrophy rates; and (4) ENIGMA-Alzheimer's- to identify how Alzheimer's genetic risk and new risk scores for accelerated tissue loss, affect the brain. We will analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods, to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and

"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,10162470,R03AG067159,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' phrases ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' caregiver strain ', ' care giver strain ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' secondary analysis ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2021,79750
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cognitive training ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065
"Machine learning for brain and epigenetic aging in neurodegenerative diseases Project Summary/Abstract Accurate quantiﬁcation of aging for different organ systems enables detection of any deviation from typical aging and identiﬁcation of early onset of a disease characterized by accelerated aging, and thus provides opportunities for early intervention. The brain-Predicted Age Difference (brainPAD) is a new clinical informatics framework deﬁned as the difference between the brain-derived age and the chronological age of the individual. It has been suggested that brainPAD correlates with physical ﬁtness, cognitive performance, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, several limitations remain in current brainPAD models. Models with large age range yield prediction error larger than 5 years and are often derived from a single-modal imaging feature set (e.g. only structural data). Moreover, due to known inﬂuence of sex differences on brain morphology, existing models are trained on male and female separately, which may pose challenges in studies with small sample size and in interpretation across models. Finally, because of the phenomenon of regression to the mean, predicted age is overestimated in younger individuals and underestimated in older, which can lead to false positive associations of brainPAD with variables of interest, such as disease status.  To address these limitations, this proposal aims to develop and apply novel machine learning algorithms and biomedical software to increase the model accuracy and robustness in three Speciﬁc Aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a novel feature selection method to identify brain features inﬂuencing brainPAD; 2) Apply the novel machine learning framework to explore different data types and feature types provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); 3) Develop and validate integrative methods to create new measures of clinically abnormal aging and compute these measures on the ADNI longitudinal data. Addressing the existing bias and accounting for confounding effects, the new and more accurate measures of a person's age from their brain and epigenetic signatures will provide insights into what causes atypical aging and help predict the onset and individual trajectory of progression in speciﬁc neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Project Narrative The ability to objectively quantify the degree of aging for different organ systems is central to identifying underly- ing biological mechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. The proposed research provides important methodological improvement to accurately predict accelerated aging and open the doors for early detection of Alzheimer's disease progression.",Machine learning for brain and epigenetic aging in neurodegenerative diseases,10127233,K99AG066947,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Measures ', ' Biological Aging ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' age difference ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' brain morphology ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stratification ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' early onset ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' biological research ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', "" Alzheimer's detection "", ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' normal aging ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' feature selection ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2021,119508
