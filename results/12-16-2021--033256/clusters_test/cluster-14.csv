"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' North Carolina ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' experience ', ' genotoxicity ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Toxicogenomics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Chemically Induced Toxicity ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Wildfire ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' data reduction ', ' biomass smoke ', ' biomass fuel ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' computational toxicology ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,10220081,R35GM133548,"['Anions ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Chemistry ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' Intuition ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Research Project Summaries ', ' Molecular ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' quantum computing ', ' quantum coding ', ' quantum computation ', ' quantum error correcting codes ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2021,370693
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,10105369,F32MH118700,"['Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dictionary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Laws ', ' Logic ', ' Lymph ', ' lymphatic fluid ', ' Memory ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Motion ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tsetse Flies ', ' Glossina ', ' odorant-binding protein ', ' odor-binding protein ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' analytical method ', ' Left ', ' Olfactory Receptor Neurons ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Photosensitiveness due to sun ', ' sun sensitivity ', ' Photosensitivity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' light intensity ', ' mutant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' environmental change ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' optogenetics ', ' sensory input ', ' Data Analytics ', ' neurosensory ', ' neuro-sensory ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,73562
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools.

"Discovering clinical endpoints of toxicity via graph machine learning and semantic data analysis Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes the development of new methods and data resources to integrate modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into predictive toxicology, as well as the application of those methods and resources to generate new hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes. The recent explosion of publicly available chemical and biomedical data provides an immensely valuable resource for computational toxicologists, but existing techniques for learning from these data perform poorly and fail to capture crucial patterns that span multiple levels of biological organization. For example, the US FDA maintains a computational toxicology database cataloguing over 875 thousand chemicals of toxicologic concern, yet only a small handful of these have been characterized in terms of their downstream clinical effects. However, informatics and machine learning (ML) provide specific tools that may solve this issue. This project focuses on 2 of those in particular: Graph machine learning (Graph ML) and semantic data analysis. Since both of these techniques allow for the integration of information from multiple otherwise incongruent sources, they have the capacity to outperform simpler traditional methods for pattern discovery, while increasing both inferential capacity and statistical power.  Our central hypothesis is that inductive learning on semantic graph data provides an effective means for generating and validating translational and mechanistic conclusions from existing public toxicology data. In Aim 1 (K99), a new data infrastructure—driven by a large, ontology-controlled graph database aggregating public toxicology data—will be constructed and evaluated on several important tasks in computational toxicology. Together, these resources will be named `ComptoxAI'. Aim 2 (K99) will develop and apply a graph machine learning strategy to predict new adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in the graph database. Importantly, this aim will use an automated machine learning (Auto ML) approach to discover optimized neural network architectures for this prediction task in a data-driven manner. This Auto ML strategy will use estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to search for optimized network architectures in a probabilistic manner. An expected side effect of the Auto ML approach is increased model interpretability over existing applications of Graph ML. Aim 3 (R00) will use semantic data analysis via ontological inference to refine Aim 2's model outputs into meaningful knowledge, proposing specific mechanistic explanations for the newly proposed AOPs. Aim 4 (R00) will use the resources and outcomes of the previous Aims as a starting point to develop and disseminate new open-source data standards, software resources, and research reporting protocols, with the goal of creating a collaborative, cross-institutional research ecosystem for AI research in computational toxicology.  Beyond the methodological and infrastructural contributions of this work, successful completion of the Specific Aims will yield a library of mechanistically-based hypotheses linking putative toxicants to specific clinical outcomes, addressing a major need in predictive toxicology. In supporting the goals of the open science movement, all research outcomes from this project—including papers, software, data, and other resources—will be made available for free public reuse. Project Narrative A central goal of toxicology is to predict the clinical effects that can result from specific toxic exposures, especially for chemicals with incomplete or insufficient experimental data.

"Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop Summary The purpose of the planned conference is to facilitate development of Raman-spectroscopy based clinical appli- cations.  Raman scattering provides label-free contrast for imaging that derives from intrinsic molecular vibrations. Because it is label-free and reports in an unbiased way on all molecular species in a sample, it provides a holistic “view” of the chemical environment in clinical samples, and thus holds signiﬁcant value as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring tool.  While the phenomenon of Raman scattering has been known since 1920, and its clinical potential has been recognized for many decades, roadblocks including weak signal levels and complexity of its readout has precluded it from clinical use. These roadblocks are now being removed through innovations in instrument development and machine learning. Narrative Raman spectroscopy provides diagnostically important chemical proﬁles of clinical samples, withouth the need of labeling.

"Non-target analysis of maternal and cord blood samples: Advancing computational tools and discovering novel chemicals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Non-targeted analysis (NTA) provides a comprehensive approach to analyze environmental and biological samples for nearly all chemicals present. Despite the recent advancements in NTA, the number of confirmed chemicals with analytical standards remains fairly small compared to the number of detected features. There is, thus, a need to further develop computational tools to derive more chemical structures and leverage the full potential of HRMS. Enhancing our ability to derive more chemical structures will enable the discovery of new industrial chemicals that humans are exposed to, especially in critical windows of development, such as pregnancy. It will also enable the discovery of endogenously produced metabolites that may be related to biological outcomes of importance, such as preterm birth. The objective of my proposal is to develop novel computational methods to significantly advance our ability to analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and apply them to study prenatal exposures to industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites in a large cohort of pregnant women from Northern California. My proposal builds on my expertise in analytical and environmental chemistry and my current postdoctoral experience in computational chemistry and applications in human exposure. I seek additional training to develop and apply innovative computational methods to better characterize the human exposome and in particular the exposome of preterm birth. The contribution of my proposal will be two-fold: (1) developing novel computational structure-prediction algorithms for HRMS datasets based on MS data and physicochemical properties (equilibrium partition ratios between organic solvents and water, e.g., octanol/water, chlorobenzene/water, diethyl ether/water etc.) (Aim 1) and apply them to derive potential structures for chemical features detected in a HRMS dataset from 340 maternal and 340 matched cord blood samples to complement the limited number of chemicals identified through MS/MS and analytical standards (Aim 2); and (2) study the interplay between the exposome and the metabolome in preterm birth using molecular interaction networks to visualize and compare how molecular interactions between industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites differ between preterm and full-term birth (Aim 3). The K99 training will expand my prior research experience through coursework, research apprenticeship, and mentored reading, with specific training in: (1) advanced analytical skills including -omics data analysis, machine learning, and biostatistics; (2) epidemiology, risk assessment, human exposure to chemical stressors; and (3) human pregnancy and development. The skills acquired during this award are critical to my long-term goal to advance computational methods to better analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data to support efforts to better characterize the human exposome. This work will produce new scientific knowledge to greatly advance the understanding of the influence of environmental exposures in the development of adverse health outcomes and in particular, preterm birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offer unique opportunities to study the human exposome and the development of adverse health outcomes. Despite advances in non-targeted analysis, the number of confirmed chemicals remains fairly limited compared to the number of detected chemical features. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to derive chemical structures and apply them to a large dataset of HRMS data from blood samples of pregnant women to study the influence of the exposome on pregnancy outcomes with a focus on preterm birth.",Non-target analysis of maternal and cord blood samples: Advancing computational tools and discovering novel

"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10260584,R01GM140635,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mining ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' Acute Liver Failure ', ' Acute Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminant Liver Failure ', ' Fulminating Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminating Liver Failure ', ' fulminant hepatic failure ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' adduct ', ' drug modification ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' drug market ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,375910
"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Chemistry ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Recipe ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' food science ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' model building ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular

"Cyanobacterial pseudo-natural products for anticancer drug discovery PROJECT ABSTRACT Cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites have been well-documented to possess potent and selective anticancer activity, which has resulted in FDA approval of a cyanobacterial antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of several Hodgkin lymphomas. Even though this highlights the critical role of natural products in the drug discovery, the novelty of structural scaffolds has largely remained steady in the last two decades. Therefore, we aim to design and synthesize a pseudo-natural product library inspired by cyanobacterial metabolites with well-described anti-cancer activity to expand their molecular coverage. Our pseudo-natural product library will develop and describe uncharted chemical space that integrates privileged scaffolds while employing medicinal chemistry approaches, such as combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis. We will qualitatively and quantitatively characterize our library using modern computational, machine learning and metabolomic techniques, to compare it with natural products and FDA-approved drugs. The long-term goal of this research is to generate a chemical library rich in natural product scaffolds that are biased towards cancer tissue for drug discovery and development. Our main hypothesis is that our library will contain chemical architectures embedded with biological properties of privileged cyanobacterial structures that describe new chemical space. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will yield a comprehensive characterization of new bio-inspired chemicals to provide new molecules with anticancer properties.

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formed after identifying a need for software to assist academics and smaller companies in curating their data and discovery of new hits or lead optimisation. In the past two years the continued importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is apparent from the explosive growth in number of these companies and the increasing number of multi-million dollar deals with pharma using Machine Learning (ML) to assist in drug discovery. There is a heavy focus by these companies on the drug discovery modeling aspect but there is a continued unmet need and bottleneck in the curation of quality in vitro and in vivo data ADME/Tox data for ML as well as prospective testing to validate the technologies. In Phase I, we developed a prototype of Assay CentralÒ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, with ~14 collaborators working on neglected, rare or common disease targets as well as used it for our internal drug discovery projects. In Phase I we also created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed and for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. In Phase II, we have developed Assay CentralÒ into a production tool which is easy to deploy, built on industry standard technologies, provided graphical display of models and information on model applicability. Importantly, we identified that customers wanted us to provide them with the results! We developed our fee-for-service consulting services model using Assay CentralÒ to solve their problems and this has expanded our revenues annually. In Phase II we evaluated additional ML algorithms and molecular descriptors with manually curated datasets as well as compared algorithms across over 5000 auto-curated datasets from ChEMBL. This illustrated the utility of access to multiple algorithms and how the Bayesian algorithm was generally comparable to these other ML algorithms. This also motivated us to develop new software to integrate these algorithms. We have also explored finding rare disease datasets and applying our data curation and ML approach to them. With these and additional collaborations, as well as internal projects on Alzheimer’s disease (through a NIH NIGMS supplement) we have been able to repurpose already approved drugs for several targets for this and other diseases. For multiple projects we have performed several rounds of model building and fed data back into the models to enable improved predictions. Finally, we have developed prototype tools to enable us to develop automated molecule designs, assess their synthesizability and perform retrosynthetic analysis. These combined efforts dramatically increased the number of projects we were able to work on (and ultimately publish to raise our visibility), created new spin off products as collections of models (MegaTransÒ, MegaToxÒ and MegaPredictÒ), molecule related IP, and generated employment. In Phase IIB we now propose a focus on steps to aid commercialization and further development of these technologies. We have identified that developing auto-curation software for dealing with complex biological data in unstructured databases will be a competitive advantage. We have also recognized that for many diseases we can have a complete or near complete collection of targets which may enable us to understand how a molecule may interfere with biological pathways from structure alone and this can be applied to complex diseases and “adverse outcome pathways” in toxicology. We also propose integrating state of the art multi-objective generative models for molecule design into our Assay Central computational software in order to complement our analog generation and retrosynthesis tools created in Phase II and aid in molecule optimization. We will validate this capability using some of the hit molecules identified in Phase II for different targets including human acetylcholinesterase. Assay Central would then have a full suite of integrated capabilities from data curation through to molecule design and retrosynthetic analysis and will enable us to attract larger deals with companies. Narrative In Phase II Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed Assay CentralÒ software, applied it to build thousands of models using public and private drug discovery and ADME/Tox datasets and identified that the Bayesian algorithm performs comparably to other more advanced Machine learning (ML) algorithms. We have applied this modeling approach to rare and common diseases to identify new molecules to test and have identified active molecules through numerous prospective validations, leading to many patents and publications. We have also applied the trademarked Assay CentralÒ technology on consulting projects with pharmaceutical, consumer product and preclinical CRO companies, demonstrating it meets an unmet need and in the process generated revenues. As we have developed software to propose novel compounds for testing, that integrates our machine learning, molecule design and retrosynthesis we now propose extending our auto-curation to unstructured databases, integrating machine learning models for a disease pathway and the addition of multi- objective generative models in order to build out our Assay Central

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria.

"Structural Mechanisms of Cytoskeletal Force-Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY  Cells in the body perceive cues from their local environment, which control cellular behavior through a coordinated series of molecular events known as signaling. Signaling is critically important for telling a cell if it should grow and divide, migrate to a different part of the body, or commit suicide if it has completed its function or been irreparably damaged. Frequently, signaling processes are found to be working incorrectly in diseased cells. For instance, cancer cells divide and migrate out of control and ignore cues which should keep them in check. Signals come in multiple forms. Specific molecules bind and activate cognate receptor proteins in the cell, known as “chemical signaling”, which is broadly well-understood. Physical forces and the rigidity of a cell’s environment also elicit specific cell behaviors, but we have a comparatively poor understanding of how proteins transmit these “mechanical signals”. A significant fraction of successful drugs target protein molecules which operate in chemical signaling. The development of many such treatments was stimulated by determining the detailed three-dimensional chemical structures of the interactions between receptor proteins and the molecules which activate them, facilitating the design of drugs which precisely intervene in these processes. Despite its importance, efforts to therapeutically target mechanical signaling have been limited. The long-term goal of this research project is to visualize how forces modulate the three-dimensional structure of mechanical signaling proteins to activate them, in order to facilitate the development of drugs that block these changes.  This proposal is specifically focused on understanding how cellular polymers (“filaments”) composed of the protein actin coordinate mechanical signaling. The cell contains many networks composed of actin filaments, myosin molecular motor proteins, and hundreds of other binding partners, which collectively generate and transmit diverse forces. We hypothesize that specific types of forces cause distinct physical rearrangements in actin filaments, which can be detected by other proteins in the cell through direct binding interactions. We will identify proteins which bind actin in a force-sensitive manner (Aim 1), focusing specifically on delineating the precise regions of the proteins which confer force-sensitivity. We will next visualize how side-wise bending forces (Aim 2) and length-wise tensile and compressive forces generated by myosin motor proteins (Aim 3) impact actin filament structure, hypothesizing these force regimes produce distinct rearrangements which can be discriminated by binding partners. In pursuit of these Aims, we are developing sample preparation and computational image analysis approaches to visualize the three-dimensional structure of actin polymers in the presence of mechanical forces with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In addition to providing basic insights into how forces are perceived by cells through changes in protein structure, our studies will guide the development of precise molecular interventions into mechanical signaling processes governed by actin. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Mechanical signaling is critical in development and immune function, and its dysfunction has been implicated in numerous malignancies, including cancer and cardiomyopathies. This project aims to reveal how forces alter the structure of actin filaments, the major load-bearing element of the cell. Our studies will establish basic principles of how forces alter protein structure to transmit mechanical signals, which in the long-term will guide the development of therapeutics targeting these processes.",Structural Mechanisms of Cytoskeletal Force-Sensing,10178249,R01GM141044,"['Actin-Binding Protein ', ' Actins ', ' Adhesions ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cues ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Microfilaments ', ' Actin Filaments ', ' Myofilaments ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Polymers ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' calponin ', ' cofilin ', ' F-actin-binding proteins ', ' Vinculin ', ' metavinculin ', ' alpha catenin ', ' CAP102 protein ', ' alpha E-catenin ', ' alpha-1 catenin ', ' alphaE catenin ', ' cadherin-associated protein 102 kDa ', ' α-catenin ', ' αE-catenin ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Surface ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Body part ', ' insight ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' fluid flow ', ' mutant ', ' protein structure function ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Molecular Motors ', ' Structure ', ' Proteome ', ' Regulation ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug discovery ', ' Mechanical Signal Transduction ', ' Mechanosensory Transduction ', ' Cellular Mechanotransduction ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Filamentous Actin ', ' F-Actin ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Load-Bearing ', ' Loadbearing ', ' Weight-Bearing ', ' Weightbearing ', ' Weight-Bearing state ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Length ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Protein Region ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Filament ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' human disease ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' comparative ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' therapeutic target ', ' macromolecular assembly ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' network architecture ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' mechanical force ', ' deep learning ', ' Cryo-electron tomography ', ' cryo-EM tomography ', ' cryoEM tomography ', ' cryoelectron tomography ', ' electron cryo-tomography ', ' ']",NIGMS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,339000
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,10166848,R01ES031080,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Data Sources ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Libraries ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Translating ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Generations ', ' Drug Costs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' chemical trauma ', ' Chemical Injury ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Response Elements ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' cell stress ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Nutraceutical ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' PubChem ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combat ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' in vitro testing ', ' safety testing ', ' candidate validation ', ' endoplasmic reticulum stress ', ' ER stress ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' developmental toxicity ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' reproductive toxicity ', ' search engine ', ' computational toxicology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' safety assessment ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' hepatocellular injury ', ' Data Pooling ', ' ']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2021,457521
"Discovering Chemical Activity Networks-Predicting Bioactivity Based on Structure PROJECT SUMMARY NIEHS has established Predictive Toxicology as a strategic goal for advancing environmental health sciences. The overarching goal of this RIVER proposal is to predict animal toxicity of chemicals based on their structure. My team and I will expose millions of zebrafish embryos to a library of 10,000 synthetic chemicals across wide concentration ranges. If a chemical shows signs of bioactivity, we will systematically analyze whole animal gene expression changes before the phenotype appears. We will formulate hypotheses about which biomolecular targets the chemicals attacked initially and which pathways led to the observed endpoint. To test those hypotheses, we will edit the zebrafish genome via CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out or over-express critical genes, to discover the ones causally related to the chemical phenotypes. These studies will be highly relevant to human health. Zebrafish possess fully integrated vertebrate organ systems that perform the same functions as their human counterparts and demonstrate well-conserved physiology. Eighty-four percent of the genes that participate in human disease also exist in zebrafish. Zebrafish studies provide a fast, inexpensive way to screen a large volume of chemicals, generate rich hypotheses for drug development, and prioritize candidates for toxicity studies with mammals and human cell cultures. We will compare our results with those of human cell culture studies to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each method and to reduce the uncertainty associated with applying zebrafish results to human biology. We will post our experimental results in a public database that explains which of the 10,000 Tox21 chemicals are bioactive, which initial targets they strike, and which pathways lead to which endpoints in embryonic and juvenile zebrafish. This information will enable green chemists to detoxify products by substituting a biologically inactive molecule. It will help toxicologists and risk assessors to prioritize chemicals for expensive experiments with rodents and human cell cultures. It will give pharmaceutical scientists thousands of new data points upon which to develop hypotheses about how to modulate a given gene target or activate a given pathway. We will use machine-learning-based chemoinformatic approaches to analyze our zebrafish data and infer the relationship between the structure of a chemical and its biological activity. Our rich data about chemical activity networks will advance the scientific community’s understanding of linkages between chemical exposure and phenotypes. Our work will enable scientists to predict whether a chemical will be biologically active, what target it will act upon, and what networks it will perturb, solely on the basis of its structure. It will enable scientists to reduce, refine, and replace experiments with animals, including zebrafish, and to predict chemical activity networks with computers. NARRATIVE We encounter a wide diversity of chemicals throughout our lives, but we are not yet equipped to understand which of these chemicals actually pose health risks. Furthermore, for the chemicals known to produce human disease, we do not fully understand how they lead to adverse outcomes. This project will systematically evaluate the toxicity of thousands of chemicals and discover the biological networks they modulate to help the research and regulatory communities predict the toxicity of relevant chemicals.",Discovering Chemical Activity Networks-Predicting Bioactivity Based on Structure,10198318,R35ES031709,"['Animals ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Chemical Warfare ', ' chemical attack ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Chemicals ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' drug development ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Data ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' human disease ', ' zebrafish genome ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIEHS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,779811
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,10074602,R44TR002528,"['Adoption ', ' Books ', ' Commercial Catalogs ', ' Chemistry ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Intelligence ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Names ', ' Polymers ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Shorthand ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Solvents ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Traction ', ' Translations ', ' Vendor ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' cofactor ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' English Language ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Services ', ' consumer product ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' drug discovery ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' natural language ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' first responder ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,750747
"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' link protein ', ' cartilage link protein ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' druggable target ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Half-Life ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Modernization ', ' Peptides ', ' Cyclic Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Work ', ' Renaissance ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' globular protein ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Documentation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Mutate ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' combinatorial ', ' interoperability ', ' translational study ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' therapeutic target ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' Software Framework ', ' peptide drug ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' predictive tools ', ' in silico ', ' virtual screening ', ' virtual screenings ', ' ']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10246502,R01GM061870,"['conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Laccase ', ' Urishiol Oxidase ', ' p-Diphenol Oxidase ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' chemical reaction ', ' electron density ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' Enzyme Antagonist ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor Agent ', ' Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' biological systems ', ' perturbation theory ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Chemistry ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Copper ', ' Cu element ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metalloproteins ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' ']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360392
"STopTox: A comprehensive in silico platform for predicting systemic and topical toxicity There is a strong need to develop New Alternative Methods (NAMs) to reduce animal testing of chemical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products to evaluate chemical toxicity. “6-pack” battery of regulatory assays (acute oral toxicity, acute dermal toxicity, acute inhalation toxicity, skin irritation and corrosion, eye irritation and corrosion, and skin sensitization) is a collection of tests that chemical products must go through to achieve regulatory approval. Computational approaches that can accurately estimate the results of the experimental testing can provide a powerful alternative to in vivo investigations. Previously, both our group and several other groups have developed models for some of these endpoints but using limited data or, in some cases, lacking rigor in both curation of the reported data and model validation strategies. This project addresses these deficiencies. We recently formed Predictive, LLC, to enable the development and distribution of commercial and regulatory strength models to predict important toxicity endpoints. In this Phase I STTR application, we intend to produce rigorously validated models of all “6-pack” assays, transfer these models to Predictive, LLC, and integrate these models into a software product termed STopTox (Systemic and Topical Toxicity) Predictor. We will achieve this objective by focusing on the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop advanced models for the “6-pack” battery of tests. We will ingest new data and develop new consensus models using multiple types of descriptors and advanced modeling techniques, including deep learning methods. We will also generate a Bayesian model applying individual predictions of each unique model as descriptors, which could assess if a compound would be active in any of the 6-pack tests. Specific Aim 2: Model interpretation and elucidation of adverse outcomes pathways (AOPs.) We will enable protocols and tools for model interpretation, which is an important part of regulatory decision support, both in terms of pf chemical features responsible for toxicity, and respective AOPs. Predictive probability maps will be implemented as a graphical visualization of the predicted fragment contribution, allowing the user to interpret the prediction and design safer compounds. In a parallel effort, we will work on the issue of AOPs, which is very important for a mechanistic understanding of toxicity mechanisms and regulatory acceptance of new chemicals. Specific Aim 3: STopTox platform development. Predictive, LLC, will implement all models in a software that will run both locally standalone and on a secure web portal. Testing will be done both internally and by external users. Predictions for individual models, the smart-consensus Bayesian models, as well as predicted fragment contributions, will be displayed on the screen and the user will be able to download a report with the results and a summary of characteristics of the models and instructions to help interpret the results. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to leverage public data knowledge on compounds tested in “6-pack” regulatory assays by creating a software platform (STopTox) to be commercialized as a service or licensed to commercial users. Computational models provide powerful alternative to experimental toxicity studies that rely on the use of animals. Today, large collections of experimental data on chemical toxicity are available, which enables the development of computational toxicity models. Using highly curated data, this project will develop new computational models to predict systemic and topical toxicity of chemicals integrated into user-friendly STopTox package.",STopTox: A comprehensive in silico platform for predicting systemic and topical toxicity,10324720,R41ES033589,"['Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communities ', ' Corrosion ', ' Cosmetics ', ' cosmetic product ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fees ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Paste substance ', ' Pastes ', ' Pesticides ', ' Probability ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' skin irritation ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Dermal ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Licensing ', ' analog ', ' Funding ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' irritation ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' hazard ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Skin ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Hazard Identification ', ' Instruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods ', ' ICCVAM ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' Secure ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' acute toxicity ', ' software as a service ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R41,2021,245874
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),10222804,R24OD018559,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' bone ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cesium ', ' Cs element ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Iodides ', ' Medicine ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Custom ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' Synchrotrons ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Body Measures ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' millimeter ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' mutant ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Helical CT ', ' Helical Computed Tomography ', ' Spiral Acquisition CT ', ' Spiral CT ', ' Spiral Volumetric CT ', ' Spiral Volumetric Computed Tomography ', ' spiral CT scan ', ' Spiral Computed Tomography ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Animal Genetics ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' human disease ', ' clinical toxicology ', ' data sharing ', ' Geometry ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' microCT ', ' X-ray microtomography ', ' Xray microtomography ', ' micro CT ', ' micro computed tomography ', ' microtomography ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' histological studies ', ' histologic studies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' feature detection ', ' feature recognition ', ' data dissemination ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2021,657323
"Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research Summary The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules, specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000 new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over 3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as well as other tools in the future. Completion of these four specific aims will create new integrated tools for the precise identification of new natural product structures, and enable inference of their structural relatedness to other classes of organic molecules and their biological properties. Thus, these new informatic tools will have the potential to greatly enhance the small molecule drug discovery process.         Unified Computational Tools for Natural Products Research Approximately 50% of all FDA approved drugs trace their origins to natural products, either directly or through indirect routes of development.

"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION, EARLY LIFE EXPOSURES-CLINICAL OUTCOMES (PRETERM BIRTHS, CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS), PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION Project Summary The overarching goal of this project is the development of new and innovative approaches to ultrasensitive detection and identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their functionalized derivatives (polycyclic aromatic compounds, or PACs). Ms. Mary Bajomo, will pursue research central to these project goals, as outlined by both Specific Aims. The Specific Aims of this Diversity Supplement form a central, essential subset of the work required to achieve the project goals, and provide an essential foundation for the sensing methods to be developed over the course of this project. They also lay the groundwork for bringing Machine Learning methods into the subfield of spectroscopic chemical sensing. Pursuing research at the interface between Chemistry and Machine Learning presents an exceptional training opportunity for Ms. Bajomo, and will allow her to interact strongly with the three PIs and their research groups in three fields: the Halas group, for experimental chemistry in the area of surface-enhanced spectroscopic sensing, the Nordlander group, on nanoparticle-based substrate design, and the Patel group, experts in Machine Learning and Data Science. Our hypothesis is that Machine Learning classifiers can be developed and used to distinguish between specific PAH and PAC molecules found in environmental or biological samples through their vibrational spectroscopic signatures. An essential aspect of this approach is the identification of PAH and PAC molecules while embedded in a molecular or polymer capture layer that has been designed to extract PAH/PAC molecules from environmental and/or biological samples that has its own specific spectroscopic signature “background”. These investigations are foundational to the detection of multicomponent mixtures of PAH/PAC molecules from realistic environmental or biological samples, using a combination of surface- enhanced spectroscopies and Machine Learning algorithms analogous to image recognition in cluttered, complex background environments. The two Specific Aims that Ms Bajomo will pursue are: Specific Aim 1: The identification and quantitative characterization of a universal capture layer for the wide range of PAH and PAC compounds encountered in biological and environmental samples. This capture layer would be serve as a universal coating for surface-enhanced Raman and Infrared spectroscopic substrates, and allow for the extraction of PAH and PAC molecules from solution in concentrations suitable for detection, consistent with concentrations of these chemicals found in samples of interest. Specific Aim 2: To develop surface-enhanced chemical sensing data as input to Machine Learning classifiers, to benchmark their effectiveness in identifying specific PAH molecules and distinguishing PAH/PAC molecules from each other by ML methods. This close synergy between experimental spectroscopic studies and ML classifier testing presents an outstanding opportunity for graduate training at the interface between two extremely important and dynamic research field for Ms. Bajomo.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Current generation molecular simulation models are insufﬁciently accurate, and current generation tools for building those models are limited, not automated, and based on aging infrastructure. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,” aims to solve these problems, producing a modern infrastructure for building, applying, and improving accurate molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. As part of our NIH-funded project, we have collaborated closely with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) to use the QCArchive ecosystem to gen- erate and continuously expand very large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems on a variety of supercomputing resources. QCArchive now contains over 42M quantum chemical calculations for over 39M molecules, and has become incredibly popular, with over 1.79M accesses/month. Large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems are incredibly valuable to the AI/ML community. Data is the key element needed for both fundamental research into ML architectures and constructing predictive models for downstream use. Unfortunately, quantum chemical datasets are incredibly expensive to generate, limiting in-house generation of large, useful datasets needed to drive AI/ML research to a few large companies and researchers with access to sufﬁcient computing resources. While AI/ML quantum chemical methods have shown immense promise for biomolecular systems, the limited access to large, curated datasets has greatly hindered researchers from making rapid progress in this area. We aim to bridge this gap by working closely with MolSSI QCArchive developers to address robustness, scal- ability, and data delivery challenges to meet the needs of the biomolecular AI/ML community requiring access to large quantum chemistry datasets (Aim 1). Additional software developers will enable improvements to the QCArchive infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing demands of the AI/ML community. As QCArchive is primarily maintained by a single MolSSI Software Scientist, additional developers are necessary for fully enabling the AI/ML community to take full advantage of the wealth of data generated by our NIH-funded project directly, as well as the data actively being generated by the tools our project has engineered to enable distributed, fault-tolerant quantum chemistry that is rapidly populating QCArchive. We will additionally develop interfaces and dashboards to enable facile discovery, retrieval, and import of quantum chemical datasets within popular machine learning frameworks (Aim 2). To ensure our tools are speciﬁcally useful for the most promising AI/ML applications, we will collaborate directly with AI researchers in the OpenMM, TorchMD, and SchNetPack communities actively developing and deploying quantum machine learning (QML) potentials for biomolecular simulation, with the goal of producing generally useful tools suitable for the wider community yet capable of driving these high-priority applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. This project is designed to improve the models used to perform these simulations, and as a byproduct of this process uses a large amount of supercomputer time to generate valuable quantum chemical data relevant to biomolecular systems. This supplement will make it possible for us to freely and easily share this data with machine learning researchers, enabling anyone to easily access and use this data for building better models of biomolecular systems.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10412594,R01GM132386,"['Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Industrialization ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Ingestion ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' chemical reaction ', ' computational quantum chemistry ', ' quantum chemistry ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' fundamental research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' data sharing ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' dashboard ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Infrastructure ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,177686
"Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity. Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough. Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment. The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument, we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk” and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care, provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening, enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies. Project Narrative Colorectal cancers (CRC) are among the leading causes of death from cancers in the US. Morphologically assessing excised tissue is the gold standard but requires fixation, staining, microscopy and pathology review, taking days and the information not being especially prognostic. This project develops an alternate technology based on chemical imaging evaluation that can provide an assessment within minutes, resulting in a new instrument, artificial intelligence methods for histology and microenvironment-powered prediction of disease course.",Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging,10318008,R01CA260830,"['Analysis of Variance ', ' ANOVA ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Colon ', ' Color ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Histology ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Microtomy ', ' Thin Sectioning ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Polyps ', ' Reagent ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' seal ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Laboratory Technicians ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Surface ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared ', ' FTIR ', ' FTIR spectroscopy ', ' Chemicals ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Route ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Laboratory Chemicals ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Lymph Node Involvement ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Fresh Tissue ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Validation ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Cancerous ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' imaging system ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical translation ', ' rural setting ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' colorectal cancer treatment ', ' colo-rectal cancer therapy ', ' colo-rectal cancer treatment ', ' colorectal cancer therapy ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' Immersion ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' tissue archive ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,466088
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10259748,R35GM138092,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Collagen ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' In Vitro ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Collagen Type I ', ' Type 1 Collagen ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Label ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Collagen Fibril ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Sum ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' self assembly ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000
"Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence Project Summary The lack of accurate and reliable techniques for visualizing and quantifying the delivery and uptake (pharmacokinetics) of small molecules into the skin has been a major challenge in the development of both new and generic topical drugs. This is particularly true in the measurement of bioequivalence, where a generic drug candidate must be compared against a reference brand-label drug. Current methods, which rely on expensive, destructive, and bulk measurements do not provide the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to extract pharmacokinetic profiles to determine equivalence of drugs at the cellular level over time in human skin. New tools, which allow for direct, real-time quantification of pharmacokinetics non-invasively in humans are needed to drive innovation in the topical drug space. Pharmacokinetic Tomography (PKT) is a method of generated three-dimensional, real-time maps of various molecular species such as lipids, water, proteins and drugs in tissue using spectroscopic imaging techniques. These imaging techniques make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrations of drug molecules to track their uptake quantitatively without the need for labels or alterations to molecular structure. This proposal will develop new coherent Raman imaging tools to create a platform for quantifying the behavior of drugs in ex vivo human skin. This PKT-based platform will be able to measure the uptake of drugs such as antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, steroids, retinoids and NSAIDs in the skin with sub-cellular and sub-second time resolution to glean critical pharmacokinetic parameters needed for drug development and bioequivalence measurements. To compare PKT to an FDA-recognized standard, these PKT imaging will be carried out alongside dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM), a skin fluid sampling technique that measures the concentration of drugs over time. The multimodal PKT platform, when completed, will be able to measure the bioequivalence of various drugs in situ in human subjects. This research program will specifically develop new imaging toolkits that combine advanced microscopy with state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning analysis techniques to collect and extract pharmacokinetic data. Using a new type of versatile laser, we will create a coherent Raman technique ideal for detection of drug molecules which contain unique chemical structures. In order to broaden the applicability of the platform to a far wider range of potential drug molecules, we will develop a sparse sampling coherent Raman imaging approach that will quantify molecules by their unique combinations of molecular structures. The development and approval of topical generic drugs for treating dermatological conditions has been slow due to the difficulty and cost in establishing bioequivalence of potential drugs using existing pharmacokinetic profiling methods. For this reason, there is a major need for techniques that can enable the direct visualization and quantification of drugs as they flow and accumulate within tissue. This proposal seeks to develop Pharmacokinetic Tomography imaging tools that make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrational properties of drugs to create a platform translatable to human studies for the measurement of drug bioequivalence.",Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence,10224202,U01FD006698,[''],FDA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,247181
"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Facility Accesses ', ' Glutamine ', ' Gln ', ' L-Glutamine ', ' Q Levoglutamide ', ' Q.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets.

"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",10266027,R01GM111645,"['Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Catalysis ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Couples ', ' Crystallization ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Freezing ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase ', ' 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA Reductase ', ' HMG CoA Reductases ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Oxidoreductase ', ' Dehydrogenases ', ' Oxidoreductase Gene ', ' Reductases ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudomonas ', ' Chrysemonas ', ' Flavimonas ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' electron density ', ' enzyme mechanism ', ' experience ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' particle ', ' structural biology ', ' biophysical chemistry ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' movie ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Enzymatic Biochemistry ', ' Enzymology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' molecular scale ', ' quantum ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' synthetic biology ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,321539
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools.

"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,10163220,R01GM136780,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Design ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Motion ', ' Names ', ' Noise ', ' Particle Size ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Ion Pumps ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Pythons ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' particle ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' molecular mass ', ' Molecular Motors ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo computational algorithm ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo method ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo technique ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' protein complex ', ' Institution ', ' small molecule ', ' Polymerase ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' data acquisition ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Structural Protein ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312940
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Affect ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capsid ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Failure ', ' Virus Assembly ', ' viral assembly ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' dimer ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' protein oligomer ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' lead optimization ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' virus pathogen ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Anions ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biology ', ' Carrier Proteins ', ' Transport Protein Gene ', ' Transport Proteins ', ' Transporter Protein ', ' Catalysis ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Proton Pump ', ' H(+) Pump ', ' H+ Pump ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Kinetics ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Oligopeptides ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Wisconsin ', ' antiporter ', ' Ion Transport ', ' protonation ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' chemical reaction ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Co-Transporters ', ' symporter ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' chemical bond ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' Phosphate Transport Proteins ', ' Phosphate Transporters ', ' Inorganic Phosphate Transporter ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Influenza B ', ' Influenza Viruses Type B ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type B ', ' Influenza B Virus ', ' delta pH ', ' deltapH ', ' pH gradient ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' ATP Synthesis ', ' ATP Synthesis Pathway ', ' Data ', ' Quantum Mechanics ', ' Transport Process ', ' Molecular Transport ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anti-influenza drug ', ' anti-flu drug ', ' antiflu drug ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multi drug transporter ', ' multidrug transporter ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' in silico ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target.
