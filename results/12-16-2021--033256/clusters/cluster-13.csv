"Neuroimaging-based biomarkers for two components of pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain. The challenge Pain is a central health problem that affects quality of life and productivity for a large segment of the population. Lost work time due to pain costs America an estimated $65 billion annually. The challenge in this request for applications is to define robust and meaningful biomarkers that can serve as objective, quantitative measures of pain-related processes. Currently, pain assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self- reports, which are inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological nociceptive (pain-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of pain. Objective biomarkers would be useful for both understanding pain and for predicting pain when self-reports are unavailable or unreliable. They would accelerate the pace of research on pain and enhance patient care in several ways. First, biomarkers could serve as intermediate outcome measures in clinical trials and treatments, making clinical trials less costly and treatments better matched to patients' individual needs. Second, biomarkers could help develop new interventions for pain that directly target specific brain systems, i.e., with non-invasive brain stimulation, which would open up new possibilities for pain management. Third, research on biomarkers could improve the quality of decision-making about pain in legal contexts. Our approach We outline a proposal for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in conjunction with other methods, to develop and validate biomarkers for two components of reported pain experience in an acute, experimentally induced pain setting. A central part of this endeavor is the use of machine-learning algorithms to develop optimal fMRI-based predictors of pain. Machine-learning based biomarkers are essentially patterns of activity across brain regions with maximal predictive accuracy and discriminative validity for separating physical and non-physical (e.g., social or emotional) pain. These patterns can serve as the basis for tracking multiple components of pain processing without relying on self-report. Rather than simply trying to develop alternative measures that predict self-reports, however, we place a particular emphasis on identifying separable component brain processes that make different contributions to pain reports. By identifying biomarkers for component processes underlying pain, we aim to develop objective, brain-based measures of ""intermediate phenotypes"" that could be independently targeted for treatment, and so are useful in their own right beyond their ability to provide surrogate measures for pain reports.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to identify the brain components that contribute to pain in a particular individual would allow care providers to select treatments appropriate for the individual. We have specific reason to believe that at least two separable components can be identified. New results from our laboratory suggest that at least two distinct brain networks make separable contributions to reported pain. One network, the ""pain-processing network"" (PPN), responds to painful peripheral stimulation (e.g., heat on the skin), and includes classic pain-processing regions. A second network, the ""emotional appraisal network"" (EAN), does not respond to stimulation of the body, but is involved in the cognitive generation of emotion. In our recent fMRI work on pain, both networks appear to make independent contributions to predicting how much pain a person will report in response to a given stimulus. Our goal is to develop biomarkers based on these two putative components. We plan to achieve these broad goals using converging evidence from three complementary approaches, each of which will be pursued in parallel and addressed in one Specific Aim. In Aim 1, we will develop fMRI- based pain biomarkers using machine learning techniques. We will use a set of fMRI data from several acute thermal pain experiments collected in our laboratory over the past 3 years (combined N = 157). These datasets have highly homogenous scanning and experimental protocols and were designed with the goal of fMRI-based pain prediction in mind. Their existence will allow us to accelerate the pace of computational biomarker development. In Aim 2, we will test whether the fMRI-based biomarkers we develop are causally related to pain, using combined fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Biomarkers that are causally related to pain are most likely to be useful as targets for drug or other treatments. We will stimulate regions within the PPN and EAN during fMRI scanning, and test whether effects on activity and connectivity in each network predict changes in pain experience. In Aim 3, we will extend our biomarker validation to chronic pain. We will test whether biomarkers developed in Aims 1 and 2 predict patterns of hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli in patients with focal lesions in the PPN and EAN. Together, these approaches provide three complementary ways of developing and validating fMRI-based biomarkers for pain. )       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.                  Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain.

"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment.

"Learned regulation of the limbic network via combined EEG and fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop a novel potential treatment for common neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically chronic pain syndrome and affective disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have previously shown that real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) can provide a feedback signal (neurofeedback) that allows people to gain learned voluntary control of activation in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), which in turn alters pain perception. Here, we aim to develop a brain-validated electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback method that involves simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. This system will then be used to determine EEG signatures reflective of regulation of rACC and of the amygdala. Multiple psychiatric states (e.g., depressive, anxious) are associated with an inability to regulate emotion and appear to be characterized by dysfunction of the limbic circuit including the ACC and amygdala. However, current psychiatric treatment approaches typically lack specificity regarding brain networks and mechanisms. Based on research studies indicating that individuals can be trained to regulate their own mental and physiological responses through online feedback, the proposed study aims to develop a novel tool for enhancing physiological resilience through psychological training using brain signals as the basis for such feedback. Thus, neurofeedback can provide a potential, complementary/alternate approach for treatment of neuropsychiatric disturbances. The combination of simultaneously acquired high spatial-resolution fMRI data and high temporal-resolution EEG data together with advanced statistical learning approaches provide a plausible way to infer and generate a robust and effective EEG neurofeedback signals that can target even deep brain structures such as the rACC or amygdala as the source of feedback. Given the high prevalence of psychopathology and the non-specific targeting of current treatments, the development of a robust method for learned regulation of specific limbic regions is important. Specifically, the new EEG-neurofeedback tool could be a novel, rational, neuroscience-based therapeutic intervention that could become a portable, easy-to-use, and low-cost clinical tool for improving self-control over brain working. In the long-term such a technique could be useful in alleviating chronic pain and regulating emotional instability and agony in cases of depression and anxiety syndromes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences. This project aims to develop a novel system that enables people to learn to regulate pain and emotion, which could lead to improved outcomes for major neuropsychiatric diseases that are often unresponsive to current treatments.              The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences.

"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain.

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children.

"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.          Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.

"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.            ",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their

"Identification of Clinically Relevant TMD Subtypes Using Cluster Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population. Yet in clinical practice, TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain and dysfunction, with treatment for many patients based on little more than symptomatic care. This discrepancy between the scope of suffering and paucity of effective, evidence-based care can be attributed in part to the fact that TMD is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Numerous different biological mechanisms may contribute to orofacial pain, and the most efficacious treatment is likely to depend on the mechanism that is causing the pain. Moreover, patients who do not meet the clinical criteria for TMD may nevertheless experience subclinical symptoms caused by these same biological mechanisms. Such patients may have elevated risk of developing first-onset TMD, and it may be possible to prevent the development of TMD in these patients by providing them with appropriate preventative therapy. Thus, it would be desirable to identify more homogeneous subgroups among TMD patients and TMD-free controls with comparable symptoms. Fortuitously, this goal can be accomplished without an expensive large-scale study. We have generated a large data set during the course of the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA; U01-DE017018-08) study, which is a large-scale prospective study designed to identify psychological, physiological, and genetic factors contributing to the onset and persistence of TMD. Our proposed study is to reanalyze the data collected in OPPERA using cluster analysis and other machine learning methods to identify clinically relevant subtypes of TMD and TMD-like symptoms. To achieve these goals, we will focus on the following specific aims: 1. Using cluster analysis, we will identify and validate latent constructs underlying pain symptoms that define subgroups of OPPERA participants. We hypothesize that we will identify novel subgroups of patients with TMD that differ in clinically and etiologically meaningful ways. We further hypothesize that TMD-free controls can be grouped into similar clusters. 2. Using discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and more advanced machine learning methods, we will develop rules for classifying TMD patients into subgroups. We hypothesize that we will develop simple classification criteria for the different subgroups of TMD that we identify in Specific Aim 1. 3. Using genetic association analysis, we will identify SNP's that are associated with subtypes of TMD. We hypothesize that we will identify SNP's associated with each subtype of TMD, offering additional biological insight into the mechanisms underlying different forms of TMD. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population, yet TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain.

"Learned regulation of the limbic network via combined EEG and fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop a novel potential treatment for common neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically chronic pain syndrome and affective disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have previously shown that real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) can provide a feedback signal (neurofeedback) that allows people to gain learned voluntary control of activation in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), which in turn alters pain perception. Here, we aim to develop a brain-validated electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback method that involves simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. This system will then be used to determine EEG signatures reflective of regulation of rACC and of the amygdala. Multiple psychiatric states (e.g., depressive, anxious) are associated with an inability to regulate emotion and appear to be characterized by dysfunction of the limbic circuit including the ACC and amygdala. However, current psychiatric treatment approaches typically lack specificity regarding brain networks and mechanisms. Based on research studies indicating that individuals can be trained to regulate their own mental and physiological responses through online feedback, the proposed study aims to develop a novel tool for enhancing physiological resilience through psychological training using brain signals as the basis for such feedback. Thus, neurofeedback can provide a potential, complementary/alternate approach for treatment of neuropsychiatric disturbances. The combination of simultaneously acquired high spatial-resolution fMRI data and high temporal-resolution EEG data together with advanced statistical learning approaches provide a plausible way to infer and generate a robust and effective EEG neurofeedback signals that can target even deep brain structures such as the rACC or amygdala as the source of feedback. Given the high prevalence of psychopathology and the non-specific targeting of current treatments, the development of a robust method for learned regulation of specific limbic regions is important. Specifically, the new EEG-neurofeedback tool could be a novel, rational, neuroscience-based therapeutic intervention that could become a portable, easy-to-use, and low-cost clinical tool for improving self-control over brain working. In the long-term such a technique could be useful in alleviating chronic pain and regulating emotional instability and agony in cases of depression and anxiety syndromes.          The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences. This project aims to develop a novel system that enables people to learn to regulate pain and emotion, which could lead to improved outcomes for major neuropsychiatric diseases that are often unresponsive to current treatments.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.                ",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8481081,R01DA035484,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' Naproxen ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Physicians ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thiophene)propanamide ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ', ' duloxetine ', ' 3-(4-methoxycarbonyl-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-1-piperidine)propanoic acid methyl ester ', ' 1-Piperidinepropanoic acid, 4-(methoxy-carbonyl)-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-, methyl ester ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2013,650387,0.5385201757873552
"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment. The results of this study may suggest various procedures to use placebos to give people pain relief, even if they know the treatment is a placebo.                ",FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia,8701875,F31DA034516,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Belief ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' low temperature ', ' cold temperature ', ' Elements ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Methods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rhombencephalon ', ' Hind Brain ', ' hindbrain ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cream ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Operating System ', ' Instruction ', ' vector ', ' habit learning ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2013,38914,0.4918959526036864

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain.

"Evaluation of Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis using the NAPS2 cohorts  Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive and destructive inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. One of the most distressing features is pain, which occurs in ~90% of patients, about half of whom have constant pain, which is associated with increased hospitalization and lower quality of life. Since there are multiple pain etiologies and since no standardized method exists to assess pain in patients with CP, novel approaches are needed to better understand the mechanisms of pain in CP and how it can be appropriately treated. The North American Pancreatitis Study 2 (NAPS2) recruited, phenotyped, and obtained biospecimens from the largest US cohort of pancreatitis, and we have completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that includes 1,171 NAPS2 CP cases for whom detailed phenotypic pain data are available. We propose to analyze the NAPS2 data set and biospecimens (DNA, serum, pancreas tissue) to define genetic risks and potential mechanisms of constant pain, identify markers of inflammatory pain, and characterize clinical pain complexes that can guide patient management. We have already identified through the full and a nested GWAS 8 candidate genes for ""constant"" pain. Aim 1 will determine whether these variants are associated with functional changes in genes associated with the constant pain phenotype. Targeted SNP genotyping and gene expression studies will be conducted, including mRNA studies and immunohistochemical staining in human samples. Aim 2 will determine whether c-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine biomarkers correlate with constant pain. Pain is an indicator of active inflammation, with pro-inflammatory cytokines increasing pain, and anti-inflammatory cytokines diminishing pain. We will test 500 NAPS2 samples for elevated CRP and 10 Th1/Th2 cytokines as biomarkers of inflammation. For positive controls we will include blood samples from 40 acute pancreatitis patients who remain hospitalized for > 4 days for pain or inflammation. Aim 3 will apply machine-learning approaches to test for correlation of genotype, biomarkers, and morphology (obstruction) with quantitative measures of pain pattern, severity, and character as well as SF12 v2 quality of life scores (mental and physical) while controlling for sex, smoking, and alcohol. We anticipate that our machine learning approaches will provide decision rules for the proper classification of pain according to etiology worthy of formal testing in clinical trials. In addition, use of machine learning is anticipated to provide insight into pain mechanism by optimally linking the symptoms signatures, biomarkers, imaging studies, and genetics to complex mechanisms that are seen in patients with painful CP. The goal of this study is to use existing NAPS2 data and biospecimens to construct a framework for future clinical studies that test the effectiveness of personalized pain management based on our machine-learning-predicted etiology rather than symptoms alone. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is a medical condition that is poorly understood. One of the most distressing factors is severe chronic pain, which develops in about half of all patients for no clear reason. We will carefully analyze all the clinical data, CT scan results, lifestyle factors, and selected genes from the largest study of chronic pancreatitis in th US to better understand the origin of pain in chronic pancreatitis.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.                ",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8701264,R01DA035484,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' Naproxen ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Physicians ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thiophene)propanamide ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ', ' duloxetine ', ' 3-(4-methoxycarbonyl-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-1-piperidine)propanoic acid methyl ester ', ' 1-Piperidinepropanoic acid, 4-(methoxy-carbonyl)-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-, methyl ester ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2014,589279,0.5385201757873552
"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia. Our team is very experienced in the analysis of complex pain mechanisms and is developing novel tools and classification algorithms to identify the relative contribution of multiple pain mechanisms in individual patients to enhance diagnosis and choice of tailored, mechanistic-based treatments.                ",A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia,8698643,R01HD072983,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Attention ', ' C Fiber ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' psychophysical ', ' Psychophysics ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Vestibular Apparatus ', ' Vestibule ', ' vulvar ', ' Vulva ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' oral facial pain ', ' Orofacial Pain ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' vulva discomfort ', ' Vulvar discomfort ', ' Vulval discomfort ', ' Burning vulva ', ' Vulvodynia ', ' Muscular Tension ', ' Muscle Tension ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' psychological distress ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Persistent pain ', ' Chronic disabling pain ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' central sensitization ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,359139,0.4968169823146851
"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8916319,R01DA035484,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' Naproxen ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Physicians ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thiophene)propanamide ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ', ' duloxetine ', ' 3-(4-methoxycarbonyl-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-1-piperidine)propanoic acid methyl ester ', ' 1-Piperidinepropanoic acid, 4-(methoxy-carbonyl)-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-, methyl ester ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2014,159996,0.5385201757873552
"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.            ",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.          Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.

"Identification of Clinically Relevant TMD Subtypes Using Cluster Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population. Yet in clinical practice, TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain and dysfunction, with treatment for many patients based on little more than symptomatic care. This discrepancy between the scope of suffering and paucity of effective, evidence-based care can be attributed in part to the fact that TMD is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Numerous different biological mechanisms may contribute to orofacial pain, and the most efficacious treatment is likely to depend on the mechanism that is causing the pain. Moreover, patients who do not meet the clinical criteria for TMD may nevertheless experience subclinical symptoms caused by these same biological mechanisms. Such patients may have elevated risk of developing first-onset TMD, and it may be possible to prevent the development of TMD in these patients by providing them with appropriate preventative therapy. Thus, it would be desirable to identify more homogeneous subgroups among TMD patients and TMD-free controls with comparable symptoms. Fortuitously, this goal can be accomplished without an expensive large-scale study. We have generated a large data set during the course of the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA; U01-DE017018-08) study, which is a large-scale prospective study designed to identify psychological, physiological, and genetic factors contributing to the onset and persistence of TMD. Our proposed study is to reanalyze the data collected in OPPERA using cluster analysis and other machine learning methods to identify clinically relevant subtypes of TMD and TMD-like symptoms. To achieve these goals, we will focus on the following specific aims: 1. Using cluster analysis, we will identify and validate latent constructs underlying pain symptoms that define subgroups of OPPERA participants. We hypothesize that we will identify novel subgroups of patients with TMD that differ in clinically and etiologically meaningful ways. We further hypothesize that TMD-free controls can be grouped into similar clusters. 2. Using discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and more advanced machine learning methods, we will develop rules for classifying TMD patients into subgroups. We hypothesize that we will develop simple classification criteria for the different subgroups of TMD that we identify in Specific Aim 1. 3. Using genetic association analysis, we will identify SNP's that are associated with subtypes of TMD. We hypothesize that we will identify SNP's associated with each subtype of TMD, offering additional biological insight into the mechanisms underlying different forms of TMD. !

The objective of this proposal is to identify subgroups of TMD and corresponding subgroups among TMD-free controls with similar symptoms, which may ultimately lead to personalized (and more effective) treatment for TMD and other chronic pain disorders.",Identification of Clinically Relevant TMD Subtypes Using Cluster Analysis,8704425,R03DE023592,"['Animals ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Temporomandibular joint disorder ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Diseases ', ' Temporomandibular Disorders ', ' Temporo-mandibular joint disorder ', ' TMJD ', ' TMJ Disorders ', ' TMJ Diseases ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Disorders ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' oral facial pain ', ' Orofacial Pain ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' mechanical pressure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' head and face pain ', ' Craniofacial Pain ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Qualifying ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2014,146180,0.38218900510081216
"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes.

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment. The results of this study may suggest various procedures to use placebos to give people pain relief, even if they know the treatment is a placebo.",FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia,8706840,F31DA034516,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Belief ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' low temperature ', ' cold temperature ', ' Elements ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Methods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rhombencephalon ', ' Hind Brain ', ' hindbrain ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cream ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Operating System ', ' Instruction ', ' vector ', ' habit learning ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2014,39358,0.4918959526036864

The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,8919249,R01AT008448,"['Accounting ', ' Acupuncture Therapy ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hypnosis ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Manuals ', ' massage therapy ', ' Massage ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Persons ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Spinal Manipulation ', ' Self Management ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pain Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' Pain quality ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,683100,0.47661219083714856
"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.            ",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,8823966,R21DA036730,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Amides ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Constipation ', ' Convulsions ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Employment ', ' Enkephalins ', ' Euphoria ', ' Expenditure ', ' F element ', ' Fluorine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphinan-3,6-diol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methyl- (5alpha,6alpha)- ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' Morphine ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Productivity ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Measures ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Respiratory Depression ', ' Ventilatory Depression ', ' Opioid ', ' analog ', ' Agonist ', ' tool ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' functional group ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Legal ', ' small molecule ', ' in vivo ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' peptidomimetics ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R21,2015,187500,0.4354032375424711
"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8775699,R01MH076136,"['Affect ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Belief ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Concept Formation ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-1,2-benzenediol ', ' 3,4-Dihydroxyphenethylamine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Naloxone ', ' Opioid Antagonists ', ' Opiate Antagonist ', ' Narcotic Antagonists ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Perception ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Opioid ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' Opiates ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Provider ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' Resolution ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Nature ', ' Process ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' conditioning ', ' Expectancy ', ' somatosensory ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2015,648290,0.39643628328912234

"Evaluation of Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis using the NAPS2 cohorts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive and destructive inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. One of the most distressing features is pain, which occurs in ~90% of patients, about half of whom have constant pain, which is associated with increased hospitalization and lower quality of life. Since there are multiple pain etiologies and since no standardized method exists to assess pain in patients with CP, novel approaches are needed to better understand the mechanisms of pain in CP and how it can be appropriately treated. The North American Pancreatitis Study 2 (NAPS2) recruited, phenotyped, and obtained biospecimens from the largest US cohort of pancreatitis, and we have completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that includes 1,171 NAPS2 CP cases for whom detailed phenotypic pain data are available. We propose to analyze the NAPS2 data set and biospecimens (DNA, serum, pancreas tissue) to define genetic risks and potential mechanisms of constant pain, identify markers of inflammatory pain, and characterize clinical pain complexes that can guide patient management. We have already identified through the full and a nested GWAS 8 candidate genes for ""constant"" pain. Aim 1 will determine whether these variants are associated with functional changes in genes associated with the constant pain phenotype. Targeted SNP genotyping and gene expression studies will be conducted, including mRNA studies and immunohistochemical staining in human samples. Aim 2 will determine whether c-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine biomarkers correlate with constant pain. Pain is an indicator of active inflammation, with pro-inflammatory cytokines increasing pain, and anti-inflammatory cytokines diminishing pain. We will test 500 NAPS2 samples for elevated CRP and 10 Th1/Th2 cytokines as biomarkers of inflammation. For positive controls we will include blood samples from 40 acute pancreatitis patients who remain hospitalized for > 4 days for pain or inflammation. Aim 3 will apply machine-learning approaches to test for correlation of genotype, biomarkers, and morphology (obstruction) with quantitative measures of pain pattern, severity, and character as well as SF12 v2 quality of life scores (mental and physical) while controlling for sex, smoking, and alcohol. We anticipate that our machine learning approaches will provide decision rules for the proper classification of pain according to etiology worthy of formal testing in clinical trials. In addition, use of machine learning is anticipated to provide insight into pai mechanism by optimally linking the symptoms signatures, biomarkers, imaging studies, and genetics to complex mechanisms that are seen in patients with painful CP. The goal of this study is to use existing NAPS2 data and biospecimens to construct a framework for future clinical studies that test the effectiveness of personalized pain management based on our machine-learning-predicted etiology rather than symptoms alone. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is a medical condition that is poorly understood. One of the most distressing factors is severe chronic pain, which develops in about half of all patients for no clear reason. We will carefully analyze all the clinical data, CT scan results, lifestyle factors, and selected genes from the largest study of chronic pancreatitis in th US to better understand the origin of pain in chronic pancreatitis.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8826094,R01DA035484,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' Naproxen ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Pain ', ' Physicians ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Autonomic pain ', ' Visceral pain ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thiophene)propanamide ', ' N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-thiophenepropanamine ', ' duloxetine ', ' 3-(4-methoxycarbonyl-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-1-piperidine)propanoic acid methyl ester ', ' 1-Piperidinepropanoic acid, 4-(methoxy-carbonyl)-4-((1-oxopropyl)phenylamino)-, methyl ester ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2015,578216,0.5385201757873552
"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care. Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.",Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F,8901203,K23GM102697,"['Algorithms ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Regional Anesthesia ', ' Conduction Anesthesia ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Medical Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Recovery ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Funding ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Beck depression inventory ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pain-Free ', ' cancer surgery ', ' Data ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Perioperative ', ' Update ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' mathematic algorithm ', ' math algorithm ', ' mathematical algorithm ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' didactic curriculum ', ' didactic education ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K23,2015,117691,0.313414618527024
"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.            ",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),8863868,R01GM114290,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' McGill Pain Questionnaire ', ' McGill Pain Scale ', ' Methods ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Patient-Controlled Analgesia ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Opioid ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,491939,0.47929189460347704
"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9054825,R21DA036730,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Amides ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Constipation ', ' Convulsions ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Employment ', ' Enkephalins ', ' Euphoria ', ' Expenditure ', ' F element ', ' Fluorine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' Morphine ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Productivity ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' depression of breathing ', ' depressed breathing ', ' Respiratory Depression ', ' Ventilatory Depression ', ' Opioid ', ' analog ', ' Agonist ', ' tool ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' functional group ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Legal ', ' small molecule ', ' in vivo ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' peptidomimetics ', ' peptide mimic ', ' peptide mimetic ', ' screening ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R21,2016,185625,0.4354032375424711
"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8974856,R01MH076136,"['Affect ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Belief ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Concept Formation ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Naloxone ', ' Opioid Antagonists ', ' Opiate Antagonist ', ' Narcotic Antagonists ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Perception ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Opioid ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' Opiates ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Provider ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' Resolution ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Nature ', ' Process ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' conditioning ', ' Expectancy ', ' somatosensory ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2016,644555,0.39643628328912234
"Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain Chronic pain – or pain that persists for 3 months or more – is conservatively estimated to affect 20% to 35% of children and adolescents around the world, making it a distressingly common experience. For parents, witnessing their children in pain is often a heart breaking experience. Further, the stress among parents of children with chronic pain poses a significant mental health concern as they experience significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression relative to parents of healthy children. Further, childhood pain brings significant direct and indirect costs from healthcare utilization and lost wages due to taking time off work to care for the child. Yet, few interventions for parents of children and adolescents with pain have been developed to address the unmet needs of this group. Several approaches have been found to be effective at helping adults manage the stress of parenting a child with a chronic health condition, including mindful-based stress reduction (MBSR). However, such time-intensive group interventions are difficult to disseminate, with high attrition rates and limited transportability. We propose a new product which will build upon an established core technology platform: BodiMojo Parent Buddy. The Parent Buddy will draw on evidence-based approaches to deliver an intervention designed to help parents: (1) respond to their child's pain, and (2) to decrease stress through mindfulness-based parenting skills. A major innovation of the proposed product is the development of proprietary Empathic Adaptive Dialog Manager (EADM) based on a theory of emotional appraisal. The EADM technology is designed to provide dynamic interaction and relevant content tailored for parents, based on their coping skills and perceived stress. This approach will deliver real time strategies for coping and communication with a child in pain and self-management parenting skills (e.g., “take deep breaths,” “seek support,” or learn to “let it go.”) The development of an easily disseminated mHealth intervention, Parent Buddy, could bridge an important gap in available parenting support for children who suffer with pain. Furthermore, such a program has the potential to deliver a highly cost-effective program to a wide range of parents. The Phase I proposal will evaluate the feasibility of the Parent Buddy for parents of children (ages 8-12) and adolescents (ages 13-18) years who experience chronic pain, through (1) formative research with parents and health providers; (2) the creation of develop a BodiMojo Parent Buddy prototype; and (3) a 30-day pilot test with 24 parents of children and adolescents with chronic pain and acceptability by health providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to create a mobile intervention, the BodiMojo Parent Buddy for parents of children and adolescents with chronic pain. Chronic pain affects 20% to 35% of children and brings significant direct and indirect costs from healthcare utilization and lost wages. The Parent Buddy technology delivers relevant, real-time coping skills to help parents respond to their child's pain and decrease stress. If the BodiMojo Parent Buddy is successful, the public health significance will be considerable and may potentially improve child health outcomes across numerous childhood health conditions associated with chronic pain.",Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain,9253145,R43HD090774,"['Absenteeism ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communication ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' Computers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Child Support ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Self Management ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' ']",NICHD,"BODIMOJO, INC",R43,2016,210213,0.3165771871989605
"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,9039027,R01DA035484,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' Naproxen ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Pain ', ' Physicians ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Autonomic pain ', ' Visceral pain ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' duloxetine ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' cognitive performance ', ' arthritic pain ', ' arthritis pain ', ' cognitive process ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2016,581150,0.5385201757873552
"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown.

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9095377,R01GM114290,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' McGill Pain Questionnaire ', ' McGill Pain Scale ', ' Methods ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Patient-Controlled Analgesia ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Opioid ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' Genetic study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' discrete time ', ' opioid use ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,514859,0.47929189460347704
"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC.

"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC.

"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,9184580,R01MH076136,"['Affect ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Belief ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Concept Formation ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Naloxone ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Narcotic Antagonists ', ' Opioid Antagonists ', ' Opiate Antagonist ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Perception ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Opioid ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Nature ', ' Opiates ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' expectation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Provider ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' Resolution ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Nature ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Process ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' conditioning ', ' Expectancy ', ' somatosensory ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2017,641810,0.39643628328912234
"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.

"Mechanisms of Spontaneous Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Abstract Peripheral neuropathic pain is a major health problem in the U.S. because of its high prevalence and poor response to currently available therapies. Although the pain has many pathological causes and anatomical locations, and its presentation in patients can vary considerably, fundamentally, its positive symptoms include just two distinct features: spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked pain. Spontaneous pain arises as a consequence of ectopic activity in axons in the injured nerve—action potentials arising spontaneously from hyperexcitable membranes. Surprisingly, it is not at all clear what the exact source of this activity is—whether it originates in injured neurons or in neighboring intact ones, in A- or C-fibers, and in nociceptors or non- nociceptors. Furthermore, although there are changes in ion channel expression after peripheral axonal injury, the molecular mechanisms responsible for ectopic activity are still uncertain. It is also not known whether there are different mechanisms in different sensory neuron subtypes and whether these change over time. The goal of this grant is to precisely elucidate the cellular source and molecular mechanisms of spontaneous somatic pain after sciatic nerve injury in mice using live imaging in vivo, single cell Next Generation profiling by Nuc-seq and by Patch-seq - single cell profiling of electrophysiologically characterized pre-injured and intact neurons in vitro, and by measuring spontaneous changes in behavior in freely moving animals in an automated observer independent way. Finally, the project will also evaluate whether silencing specific subsets of sensory neurons using genetic tools that block synaptic input into the CNS has an effect on spontaneous pain-related behaviors. These experiments will provide data on the timing, extent and pattern of spontaneous activity after nerve injury, and in which sensory neurons.

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,9332333,R01AT008448,"['acupuncture ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' Acupuncture Therapy ', ' Americas ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hypnosis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Manuals ', ' Massage ', ' massage therapy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Spine manipulation ', ' Spinal manipulative therapy ', ' Spinal manipulation therapy ', ' Spinal Manipulation ', ' Self Management ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Pain Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Pain quality ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,541928,0.47661219083714856
"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,9245657,R01DA035484,"['experiment ', ' imaging study ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Back Pain ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Naproxen ', ' Naprosyn ', ' Naprosin ', ' Methoxypropiocin ', ' MNPA ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Pain ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Distress ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' not painful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Autonomic pain ', ' Visceral pain ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' duloxetine ', ' remifentanil ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' allodynia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' expectation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Nerve Pain ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' spontaneous pain ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' mental imagery ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Pain quality ', ' cognitive performance ', ' arthritic pain ', ' arthritis pain ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2017,587021,0.5385201757873552
"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown.

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer.

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9291477,R01GM114290,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' McGill Pain Scale ', ' McGill Pain Questionnaire ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Patient-Controlled Analgesia ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Opioid ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' Genetic study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' discrete time ', ' opioid use ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,507168,0.47929189460347704
"Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (≥65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 – a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes – merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in “morphine equivalents”; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day – many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 1.4 million US adults live in nursing homes on any given day; many experience acute and chronic pain often treated with opioid analgesics despite the potential risks associated with these medications. This study will describe the resident and facility risk factors associated with receiving opioids, risk factors for opioid overdose, and the comparative safety of commonly-initiated opioids. The results will inform stakeholders on the use and safety of opioids in nursing homes.",Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes,9328950,F31AG056078,"['Paracetamol ', ' Hydroxyacetanilide ', ' Acetominophen ', ' Acetamidophenol ', ' APAP ', ' Acetaminophen ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Intestinal Obstruction ', ' intestine obstruction ', ' Bowel Obstruction ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphine ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Research ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' Overdose ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Opioid ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Reporting ', ' Drug effect disorder ', ' drug action ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' beneficiary ', ' safety study ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' neglect ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' evidence base ', ' opioid misuse ', ' Regimen ', ' prescription opioid ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' opioid use ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2017,23642,0.14735296205073348
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in

"Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use Project Summary/Abstract Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. While useful, self-report measures have several limitations that include idiosyncratic use, inconsistent metric properties across scale dimensions, efforts at impression management or deception, and differences between clinicians' and sufferers' conceptualizations of pain. Given individual differences among patients, their families, and healthcare providers, pain is often poorly assessed, underestimated, and inadequately treated [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. An objective, reliable, and efficient assay of the occurrence and intensity of pain would advance pain monitoring and intervention, leading to a uniform yet individual management of pain and an efficient utilization of the health care system. Machine analysis for the automatic assessment of pain occurrence and intensity could be of considerable value to achieve these goals. To advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose an automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for the automatic assessment of the occurrence and intensity of pain. Recent efforts demonstrated the validity of automatic detection of shoulder pain from facial expression in a constrained laboratory context using person-dependent, semi-automatic procedures. The current project extends previous efforts to multimodal measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in well-characterized and clinically relevant participants with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) using person-independent, fully-automatic procedures. To collect pain-related behavioral responses to a full range of pain intensities, we will abduct their shoulders pre- and post- a triangular forearm support (TFS) maneuver (a pain relief procedure, [Fishman et al., 2011]). Participants' face, head, and upper body movement will be recorded using synchronized high-definition digital video and Microsoft Kinect cameras during the abduction and flexion of their shoulders before and after TFS. To investigate possible placebo effect of TFS, comparison behavioral responses to a sham procedure of randomly selected RCS participants will be collected before the TFS procedure. To investigate the specificity of pain response to arm abduction, we will include a non-clinical group of participants without RCS or need for pain relief. To investigate the repeatability of the proposed automatic measures, we will obtain multiple movement trials from each participant during both pre- and post treatment. Face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our newly fully- automatic method for face tracking and the automatic Kinect's body skeleton tracking. We will identify optimal features and classifiers for automatic measurement of occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate validity, we will compare automated measurement with patient-rated visual analog scale and obtained continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for pain measurement. HLM will investigate possible influence of participant characteristics (e.g. gender). Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances not possible to obtain. We propose to use a clinically well-characterized data to develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain.",Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use,9245178,R21NR016510,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Archives ', ' Beds ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Family ', ' Forearm ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Deception ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Postoperative Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shoulder ', ' Shoulder Pain ', ' Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Head Movements ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Skeleton ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pain Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' care systems ', ' digital ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' arm ', ' Pain intensity ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' movement analysis ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,248363,0.48689005541807245

"Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties. Unfortunately, patients and medical providers find it difficult to discuss psychosocial factors, and these often remain unaddressed during the medical visit. The goal of the proposed application is to develop next-generation Virtual Human-assisted therapeutic interviews that can be integrated in current pain practice to engage patients in a conversation about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain. Virtual Humans (VHs) are computer-animated characters that mimic the appearance and behavior of a real person and that can be used as virtual interviewers. This novel technology also makes it possible to implement different experimental conditions with a great degree of standardization, thereby enhancing internal validity and reproducibility, while maintaining a high level of authenticity. Our team’s existing VH prototype has been successfully used to elicit self-disclosure. We propose to adapt our VH for use in patients with chronic pain in preparation for a subsequent large-scale clinical trial. In Phase 1 of the application, we will develop VH-assisted psychosocial interviews specifically for chronic pain. They will address two theoretically important yet divergent targets of communication: (1) psychosocial consequences resulting from the experience of chronic pain (e.g., depression, relationship disruption); and (2) possible psychosocial contributors that may trigger, exacerbate, or maintain chronic pain (e.g., background stressful events, pain attributions). Development of the VH-assisted psychosocial interviews will be guided by prior research on emotion-focused treatment, our extensive clinical expertise, and qualitative feedback from patient stakeholders. In Phase 2, we will bring our VH into the clinic and conduct preliminary feasibility and efficacy testing. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 factorial design, in which the VH will address (a) psychosocial consequences of chronic pain, (b) psychosocial contributors to chronic pain, (c) a combination of both, or (d) neither (attention control group). All patients will engage in a single VH interview session before their initial medical consultation. Feasibility will be established through participation rates, potential patient concerns about discussing psychosocial stressors with the VH, clinic flow, and stakeholder satisfaction. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we expect that the VH sessions will impact patient outcomes through improved patient emotion regulation, working memory, and patient-provider relations; shifts in pain attitudes, and increased motivation for behavioral pain management. The pilot data collected in this application will provide essential preliminary information on the therapeutic mechanisms and patient health benefits of the VH-assisted communication approaches. This proposal is expected to be impactful because it 1) utilizes novel yet promising next-generation VH methodology; 2) tests theories and advances practice about how patients’ psychosocial problems related to pain should be addressed in pain management; and 3) examines the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating VHs into pain care. Project Narrative/Relevance Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties that often remain unaddressed in routine clinical care. The proposed application will develop next-generation Virtual Human (VH) interviewers to talk with patients about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain and pilot test whether it is feasible and clinically helpful to integrate VHs in chronic pain management for patients’ disclosure of stress and negative emotion.",Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain,9584529,R21AR074020,"['Provider ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Seminal ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' prototype ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' attentional control ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Emotions ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Self Disclosure ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Therapeutic ', ' diaries ', ' Clinic ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' Appearance ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2018,207280,0.5056189059391826
"Measuring Infant Pain Objectively using Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning Algorithms Newborns are routinely and frequently exposed to pain during Neonatal ICU (NICU) care. Pain assessments in neonates are difficult, labor intensive, subjective and unreliable – often resulting in excessive or inadequate analgesia. Our overall objective is to measure infant pain objectively, reliably, and in real-time. We will extract pain-related information from multiple non-invasive sensors, develop a sensor fusion framework to integrate multi-modal sensor data into a single pain score, and assess the validity of this approach by comparing with validated clinical pain scores. Specific aims: 1) To differentiate acute pain from baseline or non-painful events, we will study 60 newborns using: facial electromyography (EMG) to record facial expressions specific for infant pain, electrocardiography (ECG) to measure heart rate changes and heart rate variability, skin conductance to measure catecholamine-dependent palmar sweating, electroencephalography (EEG) using 32 “active” electrodes to assess pain-related brain activity, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) to record pain-induced changes in oxygenation and peripheral perfusion. We will study acute painful procedures associated with mild, moderate, or severe pain in 30 late preterm (34-36 weeks) and 30 term newborns (37-42 weeks). Bedside nurses will use validated pain scoring methods to concurrently assess these infants for pain. A pain expert will independently assess 50% of subjects, to establish inter-rater reliability and to authenticate the bedside nurses’ pain scores. From each sensor, we will extract pain-related data that correlate strongly with the clinically relevant pain scores. 2) To develop sensor fusion frameworks integrating data from multiple sensors. Proprietary machine learning algorithms will fuse pain-related data from all 5 sensors, “calibrate” itself for each newborn by using data from prior pain events, and compensate for missing or unreliable data. Sensor fusion frameworks including combinations of these sensors will help to identify infant pain with far greater specificity and sensitivity than the subjective pain scales used clinically. Procedures will be included to assess the scaling properties of this objective approach and to refine the principal algorithms. Data analyses will assess inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, verify content, concurrent and construct validity, and include multivariable modeling for optimal selection and weighting of the sensor variables that will compute the final objective pain score. This approach will eventually lead to a bedside ICU monitor (compatible with the ECG, SpO2, EEG, EMG, and skin conductivity sensors), which displays the current pain intensity and trends within the time periods of clinical interest. An objective, automated pain detection device developed for newborns (and adapted for other nonverbal patients) will reduce the subjectivity and variability of pain assessments, improve the safety and efficacy of various analgesics used for treating neonatal pain, avoid the acute side effects and long-term effects of both unrelieved pain or excessive analgesia in newborns, prevent iatrogenic tolerance and neonatal abstinence syndrome, reduce the workload of bedside NICU nurses and improve clinical outcomes. ! Newborns receiving intensive care in the Neonatal ICU (NICU) are repeatedly exposed to acute painful procedures during routine medical care, but it is difficult to determine if they are experiencing pain or not, or their response to pain-relieving therapies. In this pilot study, we will use a novel machine learning framework to develop an automated bedside monitor that is designed to measure pain intensity in newborn infants – objectively, reliably, and in real-time – capable of displaying the current pain score as well as trends within time periods of interest to bedside clinicians or parents. Reliably measuring pain in newborns will enhance the safety and efficacy of pain-relieving drugs (like morphine) for treating pain in newborns, thus avoiding the immediate side effects as well as the long-term detrimental effects from unrelieved pain, versus excessive or highly variable drug therapy in the newborn period.",Measuring Infant Pain Objectively using Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning Algorithms,9608465,R41DA046983,"['Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Catecholamines ', ' Sympathins ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electromyography ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Morphine ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pulse Oximetry ', ' Safety ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sweat ', ' perspiration ', ' Sweating ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' term newborn ', ' fullterm newborn ', ' full-term birth ', ' Fullterm Birth ', ' Term Birth ', ' not painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' non-painful ', ' Painless ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Exposure to ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Practice Management ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' patient safety ', ' Skin ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical care ', ' heart rate variability ', ' tolerance to opiates ', ' opioid tolerance ', ' opioid habituation ', ' opiate tolerance ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' rate of change ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' relieve pain ', ' pain relief ', ' pain score ', ' clinical pain ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NIDA,"AUTONOMOUS HEALTHCARE, INC.",R41,2018,210195,0.4625814255076557
"Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans representing a major public health imperative. Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for several diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine; however, objective assessment of pain has lagged far behind. Currently, there are no objectively verifiable and clinically useful means to identify or quantify the presence or severity of pain. The current standard of care relies on patient self-report, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), which presents a serious barrier to the effective assessment and treatment of pain. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes, and though many treatments effect reported pain, they likely do so through a varied set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well-being. Some patients have difficulty assigning themselves a pain rating, especially those with pain that falls towards the middle of the rating scale. In addition, communications issues, drug-seeking behavior, the desire of some patients to appear stoic, and other issues can create problems with establishing an accurate pain rating. As a result, despite a long history of research, current assessment and treatment of pain is not optimal, with enormous costs to patients and society. PainQx is currently developing the PQX-MED system, a system that will objectively evaluate an individual’s pain level using quantitative EEG (QEEG). Advanced signal processing, machine learning, classification methodologies and a large reference database will be used to develop algorithms that quantify features of an individual’s EEG that are associated with the perception of pain. Before the PainQx platform is ready for its FDA Validation Study, PainQx needs to demonstrate the ability to assess pain in a representative set of patients with chronic pain. To ensure commercial viability, PainQx also needs to be able to generate its pain biomarker using a limited montage of EEG electrodes which can be rapidly applied prior to data acquisition and processing. PainQx proposes to achieve these objectives through the proposed SBIR project. In Phase I, PainQx will conduct a clinical study of 50 chronic pain patients utilizing 19 lead EEG acquisition, add those cases to an existing database of 19 lead pain cases, and demonstrate that 19 Lead EEG data can be used to assess the intensity of pain a patient is experiencing. In Phase II, PainQx will demonstrate that the relationship between the VAS and a QEEG based biomarker demonstrated using 19 leads can be demonstrated using a subset of EEG recording locations to significantly improve clinical utility. Further, predictive accuracy using the reduced montage will meet targets for performance established using 19 lead data. Project Narrative The nature of self-reported pain rating scales leads to difficulty in accurately identifying, evaluating and therefore, optimally treating pain due to issues such as patient communication difficulties, drug-seeking behavior, differences in pain tolerance, and other challenges. As a result, patients can be either over-treated, leading to (or perpetuating) addiction as manifested by the opioid epidemic, or under-treated, leading to readmissions, lost productivity, unnecessary pain and suffering, and significant costs to the healthcare system. By providing physicians an objective pain measurement tool, PainQx believes it will allow physicians to increase certainty in dosing and treatment selection, thereby addressing the over and under treatment paradigm, and consequently reducing opioid abuse and overall healthcare costs.",Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain,9607496,R44DA046964,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Analogue Pain Scale ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' falls ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' chronic pain ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' brain electrical activity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' expectation ', ' validation studies ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' drug seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' standard of care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' product development ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' pain perception ', ' pain score ', ' ']",NIDA,"PAINQX, INC.",R44,2018,205075,0.516312351670411
"Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard for treating acute pain following major thoracic and abdominal surgeries and in patients with fractured ribs. Of the 51 million inpatient surgeries performed in the US each year, an estimated 3 - 6 million are eligible for TEA. Multiple randomized control trials have demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes when receiving TEA instead of systemic opioids, including reduced 90-day mortality (3.1 vs 4.9%), improved postoperative pain control, reduced pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, and reduced incidence of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, TEA is associated with increased patient satisfaction, shortened hospital stays, and a significant reduction in the cost of perioperative care (e.g. savings between $4,675 - $22,000 per patient vs systemic opioids). However, TEA is regarded as one of the most technically difficult procedures executed by anesthesiologists, in large part because epidural needle placement is guided by manual palpation of spinal bone landmarks followed by “blind” needle insertion. Palpation of spine landmarks is unreliable for identifying the epidural space (i.e. 30% accuracy) and results in high TEA failure rates (15 – 35%) due to catheter misplacement outside of the intended epidural space. Halving the number of TEA failures per year is estimated to reduce the number of postoperative deaths by 25,000 per year and result in a $15.5B/yr economic benefit due to reduced cost of care and fewer premature deaths.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of a low-cost, handheld ultrasound system and new automated image guidance technologies was demonstrated by imaging in vitro thoracic spine phantoms and human thoracic spines. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to support the continued development of a low-cost, handheld medical device for thoracic epidural guidance. The key technological innovations of this project are focused on improvements to ultrasound-based beamforming for enhanced bone visualization and include a new spinal bone imaging approach that enables the automatic detection of spinal bone landmarks and needle insertion site. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement in the postoperative patient population, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.  The Phase II hypothesis is that the handheld medical imaging device and associated technologies increases first-attempt epidural analgesia success rates, defined as successful epidural administration on the first needle insertion attempt. New ultrasound beamforming technologies for a low-channel count ultrasound transducer design for improved bone imaging performance will be designed, fabricated, and tested. In addition, ultrasound imaging technologies central to this project will be optimized, integrated into the new device, and validated in a clinical study. Finally, the Phase II hypothesis will be directly tested in an 80 patient clinical study. With an estimated 3 – 6 million patients eligible for thoracic epidural administration each year, the estimated US market size for the proposed device is $325 M/yr. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia is the current standard of care for postoperative pain management following thoracic or abdominal surgery. Failures occur at high rates due to a reliance on manual palpation of bone landmarks to guide needle placement, which results in numerous adverse events: incomplete analgesia, increased mortality, higher pain scores, headache, dural puncture, back pain, parathesia, and paralysis. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.",Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance,9475793,R44GM123791,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Epidural Analgesia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' bone ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' epidural space ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Headache ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' mortality ', ' Needles ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Palpation ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Privatization ', ' Puncture procedure ', ' Punctures ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Rib Fractures ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Vertebral column ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Virginia ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' chronic pain ', ' Perioperative Care ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Ultrasound transducer ', ' Ultrasonic Transducer ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' skeletal imaging ', ' bone scanning ', ' bone imaging ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Recovery ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Funding ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' instrument ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Spinal ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' bone visualization ', ' skeletal visualization ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' technological innovation ', ' Devices ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' portability ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' commercial application ', ' commercialization ', ' control trial ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' Patient risk ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' imaging platform ', ' imaging system ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' Thoracic epidural analgesia ', ' care costs ', ' inpatient surgery ', ' pain score ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,"RIVANNA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2018,741444,0.21886392470718327
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al.

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,9755656,R01AT008448,"['Acupuncture Therapy ', ' acupuncture ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' Americas ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hypnosis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Manuals ', ' Massage ', ' massage therapy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Spinal Manipulation ', ' Spine manipulation ', ' Spinal manipulative therapy ', ' Spinal manipulation therapy ', ' Self Management ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Pain Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Pain quality ', ' pain model ', ' Complementary Health ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,323052,0.47661219083714856
"Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 out of every 500 African Americans in the US. Characterized by chronic anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, patients with SCD also suffer from frequent and acute episodes of pain and fatigue. While current evidence indicates that chronically ill patients who engage in self-management improve their health outcomes, the multi-factorial symptoms of SCD are difficult for the patient to recognize and quantify. Interestingly, the onset of SCD complications are often associated with precipitous worsening of anemia. As such, Dr. Lam’s hematology bioengineering laboratory has recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that enables pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia, the hallmark of their disease, and potentially allow them to engage in self-management and hopefully improve their overall clinical outcomes. In addition, the Lam laboratory has also developed an optional smartphone app that enables automated analysis and potential for data transmission. With initial proof-of-concept and clinical assessment studies successfully completed and published, we believe that due to the multifactorial biobehavioral nature of pain and fatigue in SCD, children and adolescents with SCD who self-monitor their anemia with our self-test will better recognize their own levels of pain and fatigue, and be better informed about when to seek appropriate medical care. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved clinical outcomes. For this grant, we will first conduct a 3 month home-based usability study in which 20 pediatric and adolescent SCD patients will test these devices on themselves for one month. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews to solicit feedback from these patients, which will inform any modifications we need to make to the biochemistry of the assay, the physical device, and the smartphone app. We will then a conduct a larger study in which 50 SCD pediatric and adolescent patients will be asked to perform anemia self-testing in conjunction with answering pain- and fatigue-related questions the day of their monthly visits and at the onset of any worsening of pain or fatigue symptoms. Specifically, we will answer these questions: 1) Does our anemia self- test provide an additional objective metric that assists pediatric patients in recognizing SCD symptoms that reflect worsening anemia? 2) Does anemia self-testing correlate with SCD pain/fatigue symptoms? 3) Does use of our anemia self-test better inform pediatric SCD patients about when to seek appropriate medical advice/care? At the end of this project, we will have an optimized and validated system that will enable us to conduct larger scale studies to determine whether home anemia self-testing can improve the clinical outcomes for SCD patients and decrease emergency room visits and urgent hospitalizations by detecting acute complications before they become life-threatening.  Project Narrative Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that is characterized by chronic anemia and frequent episodes of acute pain, which can be associated with concurrent worsening of the anemia. We have recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that could enable pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of our anemia self-test as a means to enable and improve disease self-management for pediatric and adolescent patients with SCD.",Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients,9748770,R21EB025646,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anemia ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Beds ', ' beta Thalassemia ', ' β-thalassemia ', ' p-Thalassemia ', ' B-thalassemia ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Calibration ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Color ', ' Complete Blood Count ', ' conjunctiva ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematology ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pallor ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reagent ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Laboratory Technicians ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Fingernail ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' Measurement ', ' point of care technology ', ' Care Technology Points ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' ear infection ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pain Nature ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' point of care ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Operating System ', ' cost ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' treatment strategy ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' adolescent patient ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' laboratory training ', ' lab experience ', ' laboratory experience ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,147861,0.182131849428696
"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,9539713,R01AT008448,"['Acupuncture Therapy ', ' acupuncture ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' Americas ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hypnosis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Manuals ', ' Massage ', ' massage therapy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Spinal Manipulation ', ' Spine manipulation ', ' Spinal manipulative therapy ', ' Spinal manipulation therapy ', ' Self Management ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Pain Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Pain quality ', ' pain model ', ' Complementary Health ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,569646,0.47661219083714856
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial

"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use Project Summary/Abstract Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. While useful, self-report measures have several limitations that include idiosyncratic use, inconsistent metric properties across scale dimensions, efforts at impression management or deception, and differences between clinicians' and sufferers' conceptualizations of pain. Given individual differences among patients, their families, and healthcare providers, pain is often poorly assessed, underestimated, and inadequately treated [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. An objective, reliable, and efficient assay of the occurrence and intensity of pain would advance pain monitoring and intervention, leading to a uniform yet individual management of pain and an efficient utilization of the health care system. Machine analysis for the automatic assessment of pain occurrence and intensity could be of considerable value to achieve these goals. To advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose an automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for the automatic assessment of the occurrence and intensity of pain. Recent efforts demonstrated the validity of automatic detection of shoulder pain from facial expression in a constrained laboratory context using person-dependent, semi-automatic procedures. The current project extends previous efforts to multimodal measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in well-characterized and clinically relevant participants with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) using person-independent, fully-automatic procedures. To collect pain-related behavioral responses to a full range of pain intensities, we will abduct their shoulders pre- and post- a triangular forearm support (TFS) maneuver (a pain relief procedure, [Fishman et al., 2011]). Participants' face, head, and upper body movement will be recorded using synchronized high-definition digital video and Microsoft Kinect cameras during the abduction and flexion of their shoulders before and after TFS. To investigate possible placebo effect of TFS, comparison behavioral responses to a sham procedure of randomly selected RCS participants will be collected before the TFS procedure. To investigate the specificity of pain response to arm abduction, we will include a non-clinical group of participants without RCS or need for pain relief. To investigate the repeatability of the proposed automatic measures, we will obtain multiple movement trials from each participant during both pre- and post treatment. Face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our newly fully- automatic method for face tracking and the automatic Kinect's body skeleton tracking. We will identify optimal features and classifiers for automatic measurement of occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate validity, we will compare automated measurement with patient-rated visual analog scale and obtained continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for pain measurement. HLM will investigate possible influence of participant characteristics (e.g. gender). Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances not possible to obtain. We propose to use a clinically well-characterized data to develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain.",Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use,9406888,R21NR016510,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Archives ', ' Beds ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Family ', ' Forearm ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Deception ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Postoperative Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shoulder ', ' Shoulder Pain ', ' Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Head Movements ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Skeleton ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pain Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' digital ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multimodality ', ' arm ', ' Pain intensity ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' movement analysis ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' relieve pain ', ' pain relief ', ' ']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,192890,0.48689005541807245
"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain.

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9472308,R33DA036730,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amides ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Constipation ', ' Convulsions ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Employment ', ' Enkephalins ', ' Euphoria ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fluorine ', ' F element ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Ice ', ' In Vitro ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphine ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' depression of breathing ', ' depressed breathing ', ' Respiratory Depression ', ' Ventilatory Depression ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' functional group ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Legal ', ' small molecule ', ' in vivo ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' peptide mimic ', ' peptide mimetic ', ' peptidomimetics ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Opioid receptor agonist ', ' Opiate receptor agonist ', ' Opiate agonist ', ' Opioid agonist ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R33,2018,358150,0.4354032375424711
"Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 out of every 500 African Americans in the US. Characterized by chronic anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, patients with SCD also suffer from frequent and acute episodes of pain and fatigue. While current evidence indicates that chronically ill patients who engage in self-management improve their health outcomes, the multi-factorial symptoms of SCD are difficult for the patient to recognize and quantify. Interestingly, the onset of SCD complications are often associated with precipitous worsening of anemia. As such, Dr. Lam’s hematology bioengineering laboratory has recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that enables pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia, the hallmark of their disease, and potentially allow them to engage in self-management and hopefully improve their overall clinical outcomes. In addition, the Lam laboratory has also developed an optional smartphone app that enables automated analysis and potential for data transmission. With initial proof-of-concept and clinical assessment studies successfully completed and published, we believe that due to the multifactorial biobehavioral nature of pain and fatigue in SCD, children and adolescents with SCD who self-monitor their anemia with our self-test will better recognize their own levels of pain and fatigue, and be better informed about when to seek appropriate medical care. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved clinical outcomes. For this grant, we will first conduct a 3 month home-based usability study in which 20 pediatric and adolescent SCD patients will test these devices on themselves for one month. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews to solicit feedback from these patients, which will inform any modifications we need to make to the biochemistry of the assay, the physical device, and the smartphone app. We will then a conduct a larger study in which 50 SCD pediatric and adolescent patients will be asked to perform anemia self-testing in conjunction with answering pain- and fatigue-related questions the day of their monthly visits and at the onset of any worsening of pain or fatigue symptoms. Specifically, we will answer these questions: 1) Does our anemia self- test provide an additional objective metric that assists pediatric patients in recognizing SCD symptoms that reflect worsening anemia? 2) Does anemia self-testing correlate with SCD pain/fatigue symptoms? 3) Does use of our anemia self-test better inform pediatric SCD patients about when to seek appropriate medical advice/care? At the end of this project, we will have an optimized and validated system that will enable us to conduct larger scale studies to determine whether home anemia self-testing can improve the clinical outcomes for SCD patients and decrease emergency room visits and urgent hospitalizations by detecting acute complications before they become life-threatening.  Project Narrative Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that is characterized by chronic anemia and frequent episodes of acute pain, which can be associated with concurrent worsening of the anemia.

"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9502315,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' McGill Pain Scale ', ' McGill Pain Questionnaire ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Patient-Controlled Analgesia ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' Genetic study ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' discrete time ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid use ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' pain outcome ', ' daily pain ', ' relieve pain ', ' pain relief ', ' pain score ', ' pain catastrophizing ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,499218,0.47929189460347704
"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients. The information gained from this study will increase our understanding of the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its treatment.",Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy,9597882,K23NS104211,"['patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' spinal cord imaging ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Motor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Pain Research ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Pain intensity ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' diffusion weighted ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' recruit ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' pain model ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' clinical pain ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Cervical nerves ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' irritation ', ' Side ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Cervical spinal cord structure ', ' Cervical Spinal Cord ', ' Cervical Portion of Spinal Cord ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cervical Radiculopathies ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,175122,0.5198104523139638
"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak ,9755822,R01EB028105,"['Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back Injuries ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clothing ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Public Health ', ' Cumulative Trauma Disorders ', ' repetitive motion injury ', ' Repetitive stress injury ', ' Repetitive Strain Injury ', ' Repetitive Motion Disorders ', ' Repetition Strain Injury ', ' Overuse Syndrome ', ' Overuse Injury ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Vertebral column ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' light weight ', ' lightweight ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' exoskeletal ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' evidence base ', ' sharing data ', ' operation ', ' cyberphysical ', ' cyber physical ', ' health data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,310023,0.22428797202296702
"SPRINT: Signature for Pain Recovery IN Teens PROJECT SUMMARY Up to 5% of adolescents (~3.5 million in the US alone) suffer from high impact chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, affecting all life domains and posing a significant economic burden. Current treatments for chronic MSK pain are suboptimal and have been tied to the opioid crisis. Only ~50% of adolescents with chronic MSK pain who present for multidisciplinary pain treatment recover, as measured by clinical endpoints of pain severity and functional disability. Discovery of robust markers of the recovery vs. persistence of pain and disability is essential to develop more resourceful and patient-specific treatment strategies and to conceive novel approaches that benefit patients who are refractory. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, the discovery and validation of a prognostic and robust signature for pain recovery vs. persistence requires measurements across multiple dimensions in the same patient cohort in combination with a suitable ‘big data’ computational analysis pipeline for the extraction of reliable and cross-validated results from a multilayered and complex dataset. We are well positioned to execute the study aims with: (1) A highly skilled and experienced team of scientists and clinicians from Stanford University, University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center; (2) A standardized specimen collection, processing, storage, and distribution system, leveraging Stanford Biobank’s platform, BioCatalyst, to aggregate the sample inventory with clinical annotations for an accessible, virtual biobank, within the Signature of Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT) Biobank and Analysis Core (SBAC); (3) Cutting-edge preliminary data implicating novel candidates for neuroimaging, immune, quantitative sensory, and psychological markers for discovery; and (4) Expertise in machine learning approaches to extract reliable and prognostic bio-signatures from a large and complex data set. We expect that the results from this project will facilitate risk stratification in patients with chronic MSK, a more resourceful selection of patients who are likely to respond for undergoing current multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches, and new insight into biological and behavioral processes that may be exploited to develop novel strategies profiting those who are refractory. For the R61/Discovery Phase Aim individuals will be thoroughly characterized via biological (i.e. brain structure and function, immune, sensory profiles), psychological state, and clinical endpoint (i.e., pain intensity, disability) data. Unbiased machine learning algorithms will identify a multivariate model comprised of the most prognostic biological, psychological, and clinical endpoints. The model will classify adolescents with and without resolving chronic MSK pain after a state-of-the art multidisciplinary pain treatment intervention. R33/Validation Phase Aim will validate the biological signature derived in the R61 study. This signature will be useful for a range of adolescent-based clinical trials in which identification of the highest risk individuals is necessary, providing a clinically actionable intervention algorithm.

"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9830832,R01AR074795,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exercise ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Female ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Judgment ', ' Kentucky ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Ohio ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Painless ', ' not painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' non-painful ', ' Stimulus ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Physical Function ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Pain Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' NIAMS ', ' neuromuscular ', ' Persistent pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' parent project ', ' critical period ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' neural patterning ', ' multisensory ', ' Pain intensity ', ' clinical predictors ', ' neural correlate ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' psychological symptom ', ' physical symptom ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' clinical pain ', ' fibromyalgia patients ', ' patients with fibromyalgia ', ' ']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2019,418757,0.251723508610004
"Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties. Unfortunately, patients and medical providers find it difficult to discuss psychosocial factors, and these often remain unaddressed during the medical visit. The goal of the proposed application is to develop next-generation Virtual Human-assisted therapeutic interviews that can be integrated in current pain practice to engage patients in a conversation about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain. Virtual Humans (VHs) are computer-animated characters that mimic the appearance and behavior of a real person and that can be used as virtual interviewers. This novel technology also makes it possible to implement different experimental conditions with a great degree of standardization, thereby enhancing internal validity and reproducibility, while maintaining a high level of authenticity. Our team’s existing VH prototype has been successfully used to elicit self-disclosure. We propose to adapt our VH for use in patients with chronic pain in preparation for a subsequent large-scale clinical trial. In Phase 1 of the application, we will develop VH-assisted psychosocial interviews specifically for chronic pain. They will address two theoretically important yet divergent targets of communication: (1) psychosocial consequences resulting from the experience of chronic pain (e.g., depression, relationship disruption); and (2) possible psychosocial contributors that may trigger, exacerbate, or maintain chronic pain (e.g., background stressful events, pain attributions). Development of the VH-assisted psychosocial interviews will be guided by prior research on emotion-focused treatment, our extensive clinical expertise, and qualitative feedback from patient stakeholders. In Phase 2, we will bring our VH into the clinic and conduct preliminary feasibility and efficacy testing. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 factorial design, in which the VH will address (a) psychosocial consequences of chronic pain, (b) psychosocial contributors to chronic pain, (c) a combination of both, or (d) neither (attention control group). All patients will engage in a single VH interview session before their initial medical consultation. Feasibility will be established through participation rates, potential patient concerns about discussing psychosocial stressors with the VH, clinic flow, and stakeholder satisfaction. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we expect that the VH sessions will impact patient outcomes through improved patient emotion regulation, working memory, and patient-provider relations; shifts in pain attitudes, and increased motivation for behavioral pain management. The pilot data collected in this application will provide essential preliminary information on the therapeutic mechanisms and patient health benefits of the VH-assisted communication approaches. This proposal is expected to be impactful because it 1) utilizes novel yet promising next-generation VH methodology; 2) tests theories and advances practice about how patients’ psychosocial problems related to pain should be addressed in pain management; and 3) examines the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating VHs into pain care. Project Narrative/Relevance Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties that often remain unaddressed in routine clinical care.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,9800796,R01NS112356,"['Affect ', ' Alpha Rhythm ', ' α Rhythm ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Painless ', ' not painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' non-painful ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pain-Free ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Research ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Persistent pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' analytical tool ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' effective intervention ', ' Pain intensity ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' cognitive performance ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' cognitive task ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' pain model ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2019,414653,0.5311463945858276
"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain ,9791175,R01EB028105,"['Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back Injuries ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clothing ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Public Health ', ' repetitive motion injury ', ' Repetitive stress injury ', ' Repetitive Strain Injury ', ' Repetitive Motion Disorders ', ' Repetition Strain Injury ', ' Overuse Syndrome ', ' Overuse Injury ', ' Cumulative Trauma Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' light weight ', ' lightweight ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' exoskeletal ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' evidence base ', ' data sharing ', ' operation ', ' cyber physical ', ' cyberphysical ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,311593,0.25569262773814966
"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations.

"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain.

"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain.

"Device to Measure Pain using Facial Expression Recognition Integrated with Patient PAINReportIt® Tablet Abstract Our goal is to develop a product that will objectively measure pain using computer vision and machine learning technologies together with tablet-based self-reported pain data from patients for research or clinical purposes. Our device will be low-cost because it will consist of one or two cameras to record the video and a computer to analyze the video in almost real-time. The software of the device will be portable to ordinary personal computers and tablets, and it will be able to simultaneously control multiple cameras that capture facial pain expression, which is an important modality for detecting pain, especially when the patient's verbal ability to communicate is impaired. Non-verbal facial pain behaviors provide important cues to estimate the level of pain and self-reported tablet-based pain data discriminate the type of pain (nociceptive, neuropathic). Used together, these two data sources could contribute to appropriate use of opioids. Facial muscle-based action units (AUs), which are defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), have been widely studied and are highly reliable as a method for detecting facial expressions including valid detection of pain. Unfortunately, use of FACS is time-consuming making its clinical use prohibitive. An automated system for capturing facial images and detecting pain-related AUs, as proposed here, would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain monitoring. Preliminary work based on a unique video dataset captured by MPI Wilkie led to a highly promising method to detect AUs related to facial pain expression. Building on our existing research, we will enhance the performance of the automated method to detect pain-related AUs and then integrate this information with patients' self-reported pain data to objectively measure pain intensity. We will develop an almost real- time AU detection system under clinical settings using a deep learning based facial video analysis software. The likelihood scores for the presence of different AUs in the video together with the patient-reported data will be fed to a second machine learning module, which will then estimate the existence and the intensity of pain in an automated manner. The software will have the option of human verification. We will estimate the accuracy of the proposed system by extensive tests on two existing facial pain image datasets in the Phase I of this SBIR project. One of these datasets is the Wilkie video dataset, which has patient-reported data together with the ground truth scores from certified human FACS coders. We envision that when we move on to Phase II activities, eNursing llc will create a device that will be ready for testing in a suitable population to show data suitable for FDA approval. Narrative Automated detection of pain from facial expressions and patient reported data can greatly benefit patient care efficiency and provide practical pain monitoring in a variety of clinical settings. We will develop and test an advanced video analysis and machine learning based system to objectively measure pain for research and clinical purposes. This new tool has the potential to help rectify the poor pain outcomes that still plague Americans with opioid addiction, cancer and other health conditions in many health care settings.",Device to Measure Pain using Facial Expression Recognition Integrated with Patient PAINReportIt® Tablet,9608544,R43DA046973,"['Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Facial Muscles ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Personal Computers ', ' Injury ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Nociception ', ' nociceptive ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' System ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependent ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' portability ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pain Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' cost ', ' Facial Expression Recognition ', ' Face Expression Recognition ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' prototype ', ' pain behavior ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' pain outcome ', ' pain patient ', ' societal costs ', ' pain signal ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIDA,"ENURSING, LLC.",R43,2019,140184,0.5128319470157856
"UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain The proposed UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain (UCSF REACH) will be an interdisciplinary consortium of basic and clinical scientists dedicated to understanding and clarifying the biopsychosocial mechanisms of chronic low back pain (cLBP). The goal of UCSF REACH is to define chronic low back pain (cLBP) phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. A fundamental challenge for improving lives of cLBP patients is that pain can perpetuate and worsen as a result of dynamic interaction among several patient-specific factors. However, the principle factors and their interactions remain obscure because they haven't been rigorously investigated in a single longitudinal cohort. REACH proposes to overcome this obstacle by forming a linkage between researchers who study disease biology, experts who develop advanced investigational tools and methods, scientists who analyze vast archives of clinical data, and practitioners who actively treat patients. UCSF REACH proposes six cores: 1) Administrative Core; 2) Clinical Core; 3) Informatics Core; 4) Bio-behavioral Core; 5) Pathophysiology Core; and 6) Physical Function and Biomechanics Core. These cores will provide support to a single research project that is focused on the challenge of developing validated and adoptable tools that enable comprehensive yet routine clinical assessment and treatment of CLBP patients. REACH will also foster scientific exchange through an Enrichment Program; the curriculum includes seminars featuring local and visiting scientists, an annual full-day retreat with the External Advisory Committee, and half- day symposia with a rotating topic relevant to the biopsychosocial model of cLBP. Another vital component of REACH is its Pilot/Ancillary Studies Program. This provides seed money to leverage REACH clinical data and cores. Overall, the object of REACH is to make optimum use of all available resources to catalyze discovery and translation of novel diagnostics and therapeutics that improve outcomes of cLBP patients. The overall goal of this BACPAC MRC is to define chronic low back pain (cLBP) phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. To achieve this goal, we propose three administrative cores, three research cores, and a central research project. The central research project will: 1) validate and prioritize novel instruments that assess critical domains of the biopsychosocial model; 2) validate patient-centered outcome measures; and 3) investigate their clinical utility using the UCSF REACH cLBP cohorts.",UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain,9898132,U19AR076737,"['trial regimen ', '

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced,

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al.

"Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans representing a major public health imperative. Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for several diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine; however, objective assessment of pain has lagged far behind. Currently, there are no objectively verifiable and clinically useful means to identify or quantify the presence or severity of pain. The current standard of care relies on patient self-report, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), which presents a serious barrier to the effective assessment and treatment of pain. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes, and though many treatments effect reported pain, they likely do so through a varied set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well-being. Some patients have difficulty assigning themselves a pain rating, especially those with pain that falls towards the middle of the rating scale. In addition, communications issues, drug-seeking behavior, the desire of some patients to appear stoic, and other issues can create problems with establishing an accurate pain rating. As a result, despite a long history of research, current assessment and treatment of pain is not optimal, with enormous costs to patients and society. PainQx is currently developing the PQX-MED system, a system that will objectively evaluate an individual’s pain level using quantitative EEG (QEEG). Advanced signal processing, machine learning, classification methodologies and a large reference database will be used to develop algorithms that quantify features of an individual’s EEG that are associated with the perception of pain. Before the PainQx platform is ready for its FDA Validation Study, PainQx needs to demonstrate the ability to assess pain in a representative set of patients with chronic pain. To ensure commercial viability, PainQx also needs to be able to generate its pain biomarker using a limited montage of EEG electrodes which can be rapidly applied prior to data acquisition and processing. PainQx proposes to achieve these objectives through the proposed SBIR project. In Phase I, PainQx will conduct a clinical study of 50 chronic pain patients utilizing 19 lead EEG acquisition, add those cases to an existing database of 19 lead pain cases, and demonstrate that 19 Lead EEG data can be used to assess the intensity of pain a patient is experiencing. In Phase II, PainQx will demonstrate that the relationship between the VAS and a QEEG based biomarker demonstrated using 19 leads can be demonstrated using a subset of EEG recording locations to significantly improve clinical utility. Further, predictive accuracy using the reduced montage will meet targets for performance established using 19 lead data. Project Narrative The nature of self-reported pain rating scales leads to difficulty in accurately identifying, evaluating and therefore, optimally treating pain due to issues such as patient communication difficulties, drug-seeking behavior, differences in pain tolerance, and other challenges. As a result, patients can be either over-treated, leading to (or perpetuating) addiction as manifested by the opioid epidemic, or under-treated, leading to readmissions, lost productivity, unnecessary pain and suffering, and significant costs to the healthcare system. By providing physicians an objective pain measurement tool, PainQx believes it will allow physicians to increase certainty in dosing and treatment selection, thereby addressing the over and under treatment paradigm, and consequently reducing opioid abuse and overall healthcare costs.",Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain,9748113,R44DA046964,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opioid abuse ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Analogue Pain Scale ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' chronic pain ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Nociception ', ' nociceptive ', ' brain electrical activity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Logistics ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' expectation ', ' validation studies ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' drug seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' product development ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' pain perception ', ' pain score ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIDA,"PAINQX, INC.",R44,2019,799200,0.516312351670411
"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9731523,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' McGill Pain Questionnaire ', ' McGill Pain Scale ', ' Methods ', ' Neural Blockade ', ' Neural Block ', ' Nerve Block ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Patient-Controlled Analgesia ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain intensity ', ' signal processing ', ' Genetic study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' discrete time ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' pain outcome ', ' daily pain ', ' pain relief ', ' relieve pain ', ' pain score ', ' pain catastrophizing ', ' econometrics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,490997,0.47929189460347704
"Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain PROJECT ABSTRACT Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is an ocular type of neuropathic pain. It causes patients to have severe discomfort and a severely compromised quality of life (QoL). The lack of signs observed by standard examination has resulted in misdiagnosis as dry eye disease (DED) resulting in an inefficient use of healthcare funds. The identification of a diagnostic biomarker for NCP and development of a detection method would allow adequate and timely treatment, improve patients’ QoL, and decrease the health care system’s financial burden. An optical biopsy can be performed using laser in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), which allows for visualization of subbasal corneal nerves at a quasi-histological level. Preliminary data has shown that IVCM identified microneuromas (a bulb at the end of a severed nerve caused by build-up of molecular constituents) are present in NCP, but not DED, patients. We propose to validate microneuromas as a novel biomarker for NCP. In Aim 1 we will use our database of over 2,000 DED/NCP subjects and over 500,000 IVCM images to confirm that the presence of microneuromas is an appropriate biomarker for NCP by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of identification of NCP patients via microneuromas to other IVCM parameters. Three observers will each grade images twice for this confirmed biomarker to assess inter- and intra-observer precision, and descriptive statistics of the IVCM datasets will allow for determination of the minimum number of images necessary for high precision of microneuroma detection. Aim 2 will provide biological validation of microneuromas. Both the intensity of ocular pain and the compromise to QoL caused by ocular pain as assessed by the Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. Further, the change in ocular pain/discomfort in response to instillation of hyperosmolar saline into the eyes will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. In Aim 3 we will develop a validated artificial intelligence (AI) program for automated identification of microneuromas to allow rapid and wide-scale adoption by clinicians. Accuracy of the program will be determined by evaluating the agreement of the AI program’s assessment of IVCM images with the assessment of 2 observers. A similar assessment of accuracy will be assessed using images obtained from an independent site so that inter-site precision can be evaluated. The AI program will also be assessed for its specificity and sensitivity in NCP identification. Aim 4 will establish the clinical utility of microneuromas observed by IVCM as a biomarker for NCP in a prospective, multi-center study. The biomarker’s precision, reference intervals, and harmonization of performance between sites as well as the sensitivity and specificity of NCP diagnosis will be determined using this prospective cohort. Next, the microneuroma findings will be correlated with the OPAS and hyperosmolar functional tests for biological validation. Finally, the AI program’s ability to provide a diagnosis of NCP will be tested using the IVCM images from this study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have suggested that over $3.84 billion is spent annually in the US to treat dry eye disease, but only 37.3% of them reported being satisfied with their treatment. Recent evidence suggests that many of these patients have a condition called neuropathic corneal pain, which causes severe compromise to patients’ quality of life. However, there is currently no practical means of objectively diagnosing patients with neuropathic corneal pain. Validating a biomarker and developing a clinical method of properly diagnosing these patients should result in timely treatment and higher treatment success rates and therefore improved patient lives and a reduced financial burden on the healthcare system.",Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain,9829699,R61NS113341,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biopsy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' corneal ', ' Cornea ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Saline Solution ', ' Saline ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' Cell Density ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' eye dryness ', ' dry eye ', ' Morphology ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Nerve Plexus ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Topical application ', ' topically applied ', ' topical treatment ', ' topical drug application ', ' topical delivery ', ' topical administration ', ' Topical Drug Administration ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Drops ', ' Skin ', ' Symptoms ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Optical Biopsy ', ' Validation ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' prospective ', ' somatosensory ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' ocular pain ', ' Eye pain ', ' Corneal pain ', ' Cornea pain ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' reflectance confocal microscopy ', ' in vivo confocal microscopy ', ' imaging study ', ' pain patient ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2019,2120854,0.28856775025618
"Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain Project Summary (abstract): Despite routine use of sedative-hypnotic and analgesic agents (anesthetics) to prevent or ease suffering during aversive conditions, the effects of these agents on behavior and the neural systems that form memories, respond to threat, and process pain are poorly understood. This project will determine the memory-modulating effects of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl in the context of periodic pain stimulation. It is a randomized, placebo- controlled, single-blind, parallel arm fMRI study in healthy adults (under age 40). Subjects will perform a memory encoding task while receiving periodic acute pain stimulation. Explicit and implicit memory will be quantified using response time and physiologic responses, including heart rate and electrodermal activity. Neuroimaging will localize brain activity and connectivity. Psychometric data relevant to pain and anxiety will be used to account for inter-individual differences. The central hypothesis is that, when forming memory during concomitant painful stimulation, three anesthetic agents, with different receptor pharmacology, will have distinct behavioral and physiologic response patterns, which are mediated by different activity within and interactions between the neural systems responsible for memory encoding, threat response, and pain processing. There are three scientific research goals of this patient-oriented career development proposal. The first is to determine how behavioral and physiologic measures of explicit and implicit memory are modulated by pain and the individual effects of the three anesthetics under investigation. The second aim is to determine the brain structures differentially engaged in memory encoding under pain and drug conditions, using task-related functional MRI and functional connectivity analyses. The third aim is to determine brain changes correlated to subject psychometric measures of anxiety, stress, sleep, and pain through multivariate psychophysiological interaction analysis. The scientific framework for this project has a direct application in better understanding the impact of memories formed during sedation with anesthetics while experiencing noxious stimuli. Additionally, further extension of this pharmacologic modulation technique to other cognitive neuroscience paradigms could provide a multidisciplinary framework for basic studies of memory formation, the genesis of dysregulated memories, and the necessary conditions for anesthetic-induced amnesia. In addition to the hands-on research experience of running a trial, achieved through the research aims, this project will advance the applicant into an independent physician scientist in anesthesiology through specific career-development activities. This will be accomplished through a combination of mentoring and evaluation meetings, national scientific/professional meetings, formal didactics, and local seminars/presentations. As part of professional development, coursework in multivariate statistical analysis techniques and cognitive and behavioral neuroscience is planned. The project will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, in the School of Medicine, which has outstanding support for clinical and translational research and an established record of developing physician scientists into independent investigators. Project Narrative: Memories formed during painful conditions can lead to later psychologic problems, such as anxiety. This study will clarify how three distinct anesthetics affect the formation of conscious and subconscious memories during experimental painful stimulation, using a variety of measurements. This multidisciplinary project brings together research techniques from the distinct fields of behavioral psychology, neuroimaging, and anesthetic pharmacology to better understand this phenomenon.",Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain,9892230,K23GM132755,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amnesia ', '

"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients.

"Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation PROJECT SUMMARY Back pain has gained the distinction of being the most disabling condition in the world [1-3], affecting 80-90% of the US population at some point in their lifetime, with 29% of the US population having experienced lower back pain within the last 3 months. Back and neck pain are the leading cause of missed work days and rank second only to the common cold as a reason for a visit to the doctor, accounting for approximately 30% of general practitioner visits. Of particular concern is chronic low back pain (cLBP), which is recurrent and often non-responsive to conservative treatments. It has long been recognized that spinal pathology changes the way that we move. Biomechanists, physical therapists, and surgeons each utilize a variety of tools and techniques to assess and interpret qualitative movement changes as a window to understanding potential mechanical and neurological sources of low back pain and as a critical element in their treatment paradigm. However, objectively characterizing and communicating this information is currently impossible, since clinically feasible (e.g., cost-effective, objective, and accurate) tools and quantitative benchmarks do not exist. This proposal addresses the challenge to improve cLBP outcomes through the use of unique, inexpensive, screen-printable, elastomer-based nano-composite piezoresponsive sensors which will be integrated into a SPInal Nanosensor Environment (SPINE Sense System) to measure lumbar kinematics and provide an objective, quantitative platform for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up assessment of cLBP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our Technology Research Site team is dedicated to improving our ability to diagnose and treat low back pain. Our approach is to utilize a wearable nano-biosensing/biofeedback system to measure low back movements and incorporate that information into a platform for both diagnosis and treatment of chronic low back pain.",Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation,9897908,UH2AR076723,"['Accounting ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' biosensing ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' Neckache ', ' Neck Ache ', ' Cervicodynias ', ' Cervicodynia ', ' Cervicalgias ', ' Cervicalgia ', ' Cervical Pain ', ' Neck Pain ', ' Acute Nasopharyngitis ', ' Common Cold ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elastomers ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Joints ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' range of motion ', ' Joint Range of Motion ', ' Articular Range of Motion ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Spinal ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Visit ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' nano ', ' nanocomposite ', ' nano composite ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanosensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' cost effective ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' Population ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' prototype ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' phenotypic data ', ' physical therapist ', ' physiotherapist ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' pain outcome ', ' pain patient ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,UH2,2019,725641,0.4038458980424398
"Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program Data Integration, Algorithm Development and Operations Management Center ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data Integration, Algorithm Development and Operations Management Center (DAC) for NIAMS' Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program to ensure that the research objectives are met. The objectives of BACPAC include (i) discovery of lower back pain mechanisms through expert application of clinical and translational medicine methodologies; (ii) identification of new interventions targeted to individual patients through knowledge of established and newly discovered mechanisms; and (iii) evaluation of promising interventions to determine those that warrant further study, potentially leading to regulatory approval. A successful BACPAC research program will be based on cutting edge technologies and reflect the patient-centric focus that is critical to any investigation in this chronic and burdensome disease. Central to this success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive DAC that brings cohesion to research performed by the participating Mechanistic Research Centers, Technology Research Sites, and Phase 2 Clinical Trials Centers. DAC Investigators will share their vision and provide scientific leadership and organizational support to the BACPAC Consortium. Our research plan consists of designing and conducting clinical trials with precision interventions in stratified patient populations. Precision medicine interventions that focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients, instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this heterogenous patient population. Key elements of the DAC that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management and integration system, and superior administrative support. Our communications infrastructure will provide both public and private websites and a social media presence to effectively disseminate appropriate information to BACPAC investigators, participants, and the public. We will develop a secure, user- friendly advanced data management and integration system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to the BACPAC Research Program by facilitating meetings, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the BACPAC Consortium. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for technology assessments, solicitation of patient input and utilities, and the evaluation of high-impact interventions through the innovative design and sound execution of clinical trials, leading to effective personalized treatment approaches for patients with chronic lower back pain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic low back pain (cLBP) affects over 10% of adults in the US, contributing to the burden of disability and health care costs, and putting those suffering from cLBP at risk of opioid addiction or even overdose. The National Institutes of Health is funding a patient-centric research program to discover new low back pain mechanisms and develop improved diagnostic and treatment algorithms through extensive patient phenotyping and use of precision medicine approaches. Our proposal is to provide network leadership and operations support, state-of-the-art data integration and analytics infrastructure, and bioinformatics and statistical expertise to support the

"Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants Project Summary  In 2018, the World Health Organization reported 15 million (>1 in 10) preterm births with rising annual rates. 50% of preterm infants suffer from neurodevelopmental impairments, and all preterm infants experience high volumes of painful procedures as part of medical care. Preterm music intervention shows immediate physiologic improvements in heart rate and oxygen saturation, as well as improved physiologic responses to pain. What remains unknown is how music impacts preterm brain maturation, neurodevelopment, and pain responses in preterm infants. We propose a R61 project to explore biological mechanisms of music based intervention (MBI) on preterm brain maturation and neurodevelopment using electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs). EEG captures electrical potential oscillations of the brain which yields valuable information about brain function. Serial EEGs can track brain maturation in preterm infants. ERPs quantify electrical brain potentials changes time-locked with a stimulus. ERPs at 1 month corrected age test recognition memory function and cognitive processing and offers another objective measure to study the early effects of the MBI’s on neurodevelopment. The R61 will also explore the behavioral processes underlying effects of MBI on pain using EEG and the premature infant pain profile (PIPP). In preterm infants, central EEG amplitudes change when time-locked to a painful stimulus and PIPP scores scale pain responses with painful procedures. Specific recorded lullabies with simple arpeggiated accompaniment will be played for 6 weeks in a small randomized, blinded, controlled study of 50 medically stable 30 week preterms. Exploratory R61 findings will be assessed by specific Go/NoGo milestones that provide insight into the effects of MBI on biological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment and behavioral processes underlying pain. By achieving one of the Go/NoGo milestones, the proposal progresses to the R33 proof of concept pilot clinical trial with an additional 100 randomized subjects that will assess two primary outcomes measures: 1) MBI effects on Late Neurodevelopment using Bayley’s III neurodevelopmental testing at 6 month corrected age, and 2) Cumulative effects of MBI on Pain Response using longitudinal comparisons of baseline PIPP scores and final PIPP scores after 4 weeks of MBI. Secondary measures would explore more nuanced aspects of neurodevelopment: 1) MBI effects on brain maturation with expanded analyses of EEG-sleep components; 2) repeat ERP analysis at 6 months corrected age with expanded memory and cognitive testing (additional mismatch negativity paradigms); and pain response: 3) MBI effects on pain related EEG responses with comparative analyses of central EEG amplitude changes to the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Project Narrative This project addresses the following public health concerns: 1) high rates of neurodevelopmental impairments from preterm birth and 2) detrimental neurodevelopmental sequelae as a result of current preterm pain management regimens. We will initiate a two phased pilot clinical trial (randomized, double blinded, controlled) to support mechanistic research on the effects of music based intervention on neurodevelopment and pain response in preterm infants, with the second phase, as a proof of concept clinical trial evaluating the effects of music based intervention on late neurodevelopment and the cumulative effects of music on pain response. The public health relevance of this study is to provide groundbreaking results on effects of music based intervention in preterm infant health to inform future strategies on music research, given that music intervention is low risk, minimally invasive with a high potential health impact.",Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants,9883118,R61AT010712,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Music ', ' Music Therapy ', ' Neonatology ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' rapid eye movement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' statistics ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Health ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' child neurology ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' memory recognition ', ' electrical potential ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Sleep Wake Cycle ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Late Effects ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' non-REM ', ' NREM ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Regimen ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R61,2019,428396,0.3164614551418875
"Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients The under-assessment of pain response is one of the primary barriers to the adequate treatment of pain in critically ill patients, and is associated with many negative outcomes. Nonetheless, many ICU patients are unable to self-report their pain intensity. Currently, behavioral pain scales are used to assess pain in nonverbal patients. Unfortunately, these scales require repetitive manual administration by overburdened nurses, and show variability in pain intensity ratings by nurses. Furthermore, manual pain assessment tools cannot monitor pain continuously and autonomously. The PIs’ long-term goal is to specify pain intensity in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of an autonomous, clinically- available pain assessment system by developing and validating pain recognition algorithms in a fully uncontrolled ICU setting. The central hypothesis is we can autonomously assess facial pain expressions and patient activity. The rationale is that autonomous pain quantification can reduce nurse workload and can enable real-time pain monitoring. Contextualization of pain with respect to patient function can also lead to improved functional and clinical outcomes. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims. (1) Developing and validating a pervasive sensing system in two 24-beds ICUs (ICU) to determine if deep learning algorithms can accurately assess pain facial expressions from image data, when compared to existing assessment tools. (2) Developing and validating algorithms for pain contextualization using autonomous activity recognition. The approach is innovative, because it departs from status quo by autonomously assessing pain and functional status in the ICU. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and barriers in critical care, including manual repetitive ICU assessments and lack of granular and continuous pain and function measures. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. The proposed research is relevant to NIBIB mission to improve health by leading the development of biomedical technologies, as the proposed research develops advanced computational methods and uses sensing technologies to automatically assess patient pain and function.",Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients,9652119,R21EB027344,"['Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Beds ', ' Color ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Equipment ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Agitation ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Training ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Fostering ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Pain Assessment Tool ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' To specify ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' pain patient ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2019,215635,0.5424486878420242
"IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment. Create a smartphone pupillometry to objectively determine the presence of acute pain, evaluate opioid as the treatment for pain. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While patient self-report of pain is currently the gold standard of pain measurement, accurate self-reports of pain may not be feasible in critically ill patients who are sedated and intubated, unconscious patients, or patients who are unable to verbally communicate their pain. Current research has shown that pupillary dilation (PD) is a reliable indicator of acute pain, and that measurement of pupil size changes may be useful in determining the intensity of pain experienced as well as the efficacy of an analgesia. There is also research demonstrating the value of pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL) as an objective marker of sensitivity to opioids, and the use of facial expression analysis to detect pain. IMPACT proposes pupillometry with a proprietary algorithm to measure both PD and PUAL, and facial expression analysis using computer vision. Through IMPACT, Benten proposes to provide clinicians with a device that helps them objectively determine the presence or absence of pain, assess opioid efficacy, and assist in deciding whether opioids should be the treatment of choice for a patient. The utimate goal of IMPACT is to revolutionize measurement and management of pain. The novel approach of measuring PD, PUAL, and facial expressions will help eliminate subjectivity in the diagnosis of pain, and avoid over-administration of opioids or administration of opioids to patients who are not suitable candidates for opioid treatment. IMPACT will demonstrate the feasibility of using pupil size changes and facial expressions to guide the diagnosis and treatment of pain, and compare results obtained to pain scores reported by patients on the NRS, to assess accuracy of pain measurement and effectiveness in pain alleviation. IMPACT will be designed and developed to serve the needs of patients who experience severe pain, and provide them with pain relief, through objection clinical decision-making. The aims of IMPACT are as follows: 1) Phase I Specific Aims: Develop IMPACT prototype and conduct a validity test with 25  subjects, to demonstrate the efficacy and validity of IMPACT versus a commercial  pupilometer, and 2) Conduct a feasibility pilot test of IMPACT with 20 patients in the post-anesthesia care unit  (PACU) of Christiana Care Health System (CCHS), to demonstrate the feasibility of IMPACT  in determining pain and assessing opioid efficacy. The short-term impact will be an improvement in pain detection, and more objective clinical decision making regarding opioid administration. The long-term impact will be a decrease in the misuse of opioid medication, and the facilitation of objective measurement of symptoms in clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment (IMPACT) will develop an innovative, mobile application to record reliable biomarkers and surrogate markers for acute pain and opioid analgesic efficacy. IMPACT will enable clinicians to better diagnose and manage pain, through the measurement of pupillary dilation (PD) to pain, pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL), and facial expressions. IMPACT is designed to address the needs of patients who are in severe pain and may be unable to communicate their pain effectively. This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine the pain experienced accurately and administer analgesics that provide adequate pain relief, while also avoiding over-prescription of opioids and further contributing to the opioid crisis. Usage of IMPACT will help clinicians supplement patient reports of pain with objective measures of pain and opioid analgesic efficacy such as PD, PUAL, and facial expressions.","IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment.

"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial

"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations.

"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain ,9979852,R01EB028105,"['Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back Injuries ', ' Back Pain ', ' Back Ache ', ' Backache ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clothing ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Backache ', ' Lumbago ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Public Health ', ' Cumulative Trauma Disorders ', ' Overuse Injury ', ' Overuse Syndrome ', ' Repetition Strain Injury ', ' Repetitive Motion Disorders ', ' Repetitive Strain Injury ', ' Repetitive stress injury ', ' repetitive motion injury ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' evidence base ', ' data sharing ', ' operation ', ' cyberphysical ', ' cyber physical ', ' health data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,311593,0.25569262773814966
"Prognostic biomarkers for high-impact chronic pain: Development and validation PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic pain represents a public health crisis that affects more than 100 million Americans and costs over $500 billion dollars annually. Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions comprise 70-80% of all chronic pain. An estimated 8% of US adults suffer from high-impact chronic pain, or pain associated with substantially restricted work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months. Chronic pain—and high-impact chronic pain in particular—is often treated with prescription opioids and is linked to opioid-use disorder. Multidisciplinary chronic pain treatments show incomplete recovery at the population level. However, subgroups of individuals completely respond, do not change, or even worsen following pain management. Thus, robust and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome (i.e., recovery versus persistence), respectively. Therefore, our overall goal is to discover and validate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain. This goal will require comprehensive, multidimensional assessments with an integrated dataset and a sophisticated computational analysis pipeline to yield reliable and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. To this end, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research and clinical team to implement the HEAL initiative. The goal of this initiative is to elucidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures of chronic pain by integrating CNS, multiomic, sensory, functional, psychosocial, and demographic domains. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims: (1) develop diagnostic and prognostic markers of musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain following multidisciplinary pain treatment (R61 Discovery Phase) and (2) analytically validate the multimodal signatures developed in the first aim (R33 Validation Phase). This proposal will yield valid and clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures to facilitate risk and treatment stratification in patients with musculoskeletal chronic pain. Such biomarkers are essential to develop safer, more effective patient-specific treatment strategies, particularly for those who are refractory to current pain management options. We will also identify potentially modifiable biological and behavioral factors that can change the course of the pain trajectory and thereby reduce the impact of chronic pain on the individual and society as a whole. PROJECT NARRATIVE  More than 100 million Americans live with chronic pain, 20 million of whom suffer from high-impact chronic pain that substantially restricts work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months.

"Optimizing the use of ketamine to reduce chronic postsurgical pain Chronic pain contributes significantly to the current opioid epidemic. Up to 20% of postoperative patients develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). CPSP is highly associated with chronic opioid use and dependence, and yet routine multimodal analgesia as a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and anti-neuropathic agents is only moderately effective in preventing CPSP. The incidence for CPSP is particularly high in patients undergoing mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissections (25-60%). This specific postsurgical pain condition is known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), and a recent study showed that 1 in 10 patients continue to use opioids 3 months after surgery. We aim to study the effectiveness of perioperative ketamine for the prevention of PMPS, within the NIH HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network (Pain ERN). Our rationale is that ketamine can reduce key risks for CPSP including acute pain severity, anxiety and depression, and pain catastrophizing, and in doing so can prevent the development of PMPS. Mechanistically, ketamine is known to enhance endogenous cortical control of pain and mood. There is strong clinical evidence for perioperative ketamine infusion in reducing postsurgical pain, and for a single ketamine bolus (0.3-0.5mg/kg) to treat depression and anxiety associated with postsurgical pain. However, studies are urgently needed to test the efficacy of ketamine in the perioperative period for preventing CPSP, particularly PMPS, in a large cohort of patients and to assess clinical variables predictive for chronic pain severity and for treatment effects. We aim to conduct a multi-site, three-arm RCT to study the effectiveness of ketamine in reducing the incidence and severity of PMPS. 750 patients after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissection will be randomized to receive either a standard continuous ketamine infusion starting after induction (bolus of 0.35mg/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 0.25mg/kg/hr) and continued for 3 hours after surgery, a regimen of single-bolus ketamine (0.6mg/kg) administered right after surgery, or placebo (saline) control. To maintain the pragmatic nature of an effectiveness trial, all patients will receive routine postoperative multimodal analgesia. Compatible with recent NIH recommendations, we will assess pain, function and mood over 12 months after surgery. We will use Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity score at 3 months after surgery as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include pain incidence, BPI, short- form McGill's Pain Questionnaire, opioid use, NIH PROMIS scales, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire. We will also build precision medicine models to analyze clinical variables associated with CPSP and with success of ketamine treatment. Agreements have been reached with 11 sites, including 7 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) hubs, NYU, Columbia, Einstein, BWH, Washington University at St. Louis, Duke, and Univ. Washington, to carry out this study successfully. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 20% of patients who undergo surgery develop chronic pain, and while chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is highly associated with impaired functional recovery and persistent opioid use and dependence, current standard postoperative multimodal analgesia is only moderately effective for its prevention. In a three- arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to study the effectiveness of adding perioperative continuous or single- bolus ketamine to routine postoperative care, for the prevention of post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), one of the most common CPSP conditions. Ketamine is a low risk treatment option that is easy to implement in a wide range of clinical settings, and thus our proposal can substantially impact postoperative pain management, and in doing so can contribute significantly to our combat against the opioid epidemic.",Optimizing the use of ketamine to reduce chronic postsurgical pain,10154174,UG3CA261067,"['Acetaminophen ', ' APAP ', '

Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al.

"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients. The information gained from this study will increase our understanding of the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its treatment.",Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy,10000175,K23NS104211,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Cervical nerves ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' irritation ', ' Side ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Cervical Portion of Spinal Cord ', ' Cervical Spinal Cord ', ' Cervical spinal cord structure ', ' American ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Cervical Radiculopathies ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' spinal cord imaging ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Motor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Pain Research ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Pain intensity ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' diffusion weighted ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' recruit ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' pain model ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' clinical pain ', ' neural network ', ' Patient imaging ', ' statistical learning ', ' chronic pain management ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,175122,0.5198104523139638
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in

"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1) Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP; 2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro- psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Inquiry into the effects of long-term prescription opioid use in patients with chronic pain are highly relevant and timely due to the increased epidemic of prescription opioid use in the US. Using quantitative sensory testing, neuropsychological assessments, multimodal neuroimaging and advanced statistical techniques for data analysis, the proposed study seeks to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain and their relation to clinical symptoms. By detecting changes at behavioral, molecular and neural systems levels, this study will be pivotal in the development of effective pain management strategies in chronic pain, and training of Dr. Jarrahi as an independent investigator in the field of translational pain research.",Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic

"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a novel 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of painful complications in the prosthetic joint area causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction and is estimated to reach 572,000 annual cases by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing pain without prohibitive metal artifacts to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact cause of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to maximize our ability to identify morphologic causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements in detection of the painful lesions using serial 18F-FDG PET/MRI sessions. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal artifact correction techniques for early detection of complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty, including those with total hip arthroplasty (THA), are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are reported to develop persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) after these procedures. Unfortunately, the effective pain management for those patients is significantly limited by current diagnostic methods that have insufficient sensitivity to painful complications and severe imaging artifacts from the metallic prosthesis. Focusing on patients who have undergone THA, this project will develop metal artifact correction techniques for 18F-FDG PET/MRI to implement metabolic (18F-FDG PET) and morphologic (MRI) examination of PPSP following THA for enabling the early detection of painful pathology, and thus guiding appropriate treatments.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10226582,R56AR077706,"['Adoption ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Awareness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Future ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Joint ', ' Hip Prosthesis ', ' artificial hip ', ' prosthetic hip ', ' Inflammation ', ' Joint Prosthesis ', ' artificial joint ', ' prosthetic joint ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Schedule ', ' chronic pain ', ' Custom ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' Orthopedic Surgery procedures ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphological signature ', ' Physical shape ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Early identification ', ' Radiation ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' 18-FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18FDG ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' PET/CT ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' metallicity ', ' painful symptom ', ' pain symptom ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' serial imaging ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging approach ', ' pain score ', ' machine learning method ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,577581,0.39356202712989385
"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced,

"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain

Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al.

"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain. This can lead to specific interventions to improve outcomes for patients with low back pain.",Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain,9981627,R01AR075399,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Back Pain ', ' Back Ache ', ' Backache ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Intervertebral disc structure ', ' Intervertebral Disk ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Backache ', ' Lumbago ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Measures ', ' Intervertebral Disc Degenerative Disease ', ' Intervertebral Disc Degenerative Disorder ', ' degenerated intervertebral disc ', ' degenerative disc disease ', ' disc degeneration ', ' intervertebral disk degeneration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' cortical pain ', ' central pain ', ' inflammatory pain ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Mechanical Low Back Pain ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Research ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NIAMS ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' clinical care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical development ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,623017,0.3280284906352513
"Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP Project Summary Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a complex multi-factorial condition, as well as the most prevalent painful musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. Its causes and mechanisms are numerous and still poorly understood, which leads to common failure in its clinical treatment (e.g. physical therapy - PT). Systemic inflammation has been gaining attention in the literature as a likely contributing aspect to CLBP, but its causes are diverse and still lack thorough insight. One of these causes seems to be the presence of specific SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, the simplest and most common variation in human DNA) in certain genes that are known to be related to both inflammation and pain. It is unclear how these variations may affect the outcomes of different types of PT treatment for CLBP, which is an innovative aspect of the proposed research project. Overall, the main objective is to be able to better tailor specific PT treatment to each patient. More specifically, this research aims to understand if there is an association between gene variations and outcomes of PT treatment; it also intends to better understand the mechanisms behind how gene variations affect inflammation, to support the formation of novel research questions in the area of pain. Furthermore, it seeks to determine clinical sub- phenotypes of CLBP using machine learning (Network Phenotyping Strategy - NPS) based on patients’ responsiveness to PT treatment. From a career standpoint, it aims at supporting my professional development for a future in pain research and academia. The project will use genetic and clinical data from 200-250 patients, gathered from the 1000 patients’ cohort that the Pitt LB3P Mechanistic Research Center will collect; it will include all the patients with CLBP and no diagnosis of inflammatory or auto-immune disease who will undergo PT treatment as part of their standard of care within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The data that will be used for this study includes the variations for selected genes, PT treatment (to be collected as a novel aspect facilitated by this proposed supplement), the outcomes variables (disability and pain scores, pain interference, the impression of change), as well as other clinically relevant information (e.g. age, sex, comorbidities). The analysis will be performed with two different approaches: first, it will be analyzed with the traditional statistical testing for genetic variations, to look for associations between SNPs and PT treatment outcomes. The analysis will include Logistic regression analysis for the association between genetic variations and outcome measures, Fisher's exact test for proper group determination, Cochran’s Q test for multiple groups if a non-paired assumption will be found to be more clinically relevant. Subsequently, the dataset will be analyzed using the NPS approach, which will help delineate clinical outcome-based phenotypes based on clinical response to PT treatment. By adding this new layer of information to the clinical approach, this research seeks to improve the assessment and treatment of CLBP in a PT setting and to make it more resource-efficient and tailored to each patient’s needs. Project Narrative Physical Therapy (PT) is one of the initial standards of care for the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP, a challenging condition that affects a large portion of the world population) but provides variable and overall unsatisfactory results. There are many possible contributing causes for CLBP, and one of them is systemic inflammation, which is partly regulated by genes, but to an unknown extent. This research intends to look into how variations in specific genes that are known to influence pain and inflammation may impact the outcomes of PT, to better inform the assessment and treatment patients with CLBP, and reduce the financial burden for the treatment of this condition.",Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP,10208162,U19AR076725,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Back Pain ', ' Back Ache ', ' Backache ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Societies ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' impression ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pain Research ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' human DNA ', ' rehabilitation science ', ' Pain interference ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' learning network ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' physiotherapist ', ' physical therapist ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' pain outcome ', ' pain patient ', ' pain score ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2020,100000,0.3145049249018386
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9984270,R01AR074795,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exercise ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Female ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Judgment ', ' Kentucky ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Ohio ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Painless ', ' Stimulus ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Physical Function ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Pain Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' NIAMS ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' neuromuscular ', ' constant pain ', ' lasting pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' Persistent pain ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' parent project ', ' critical period ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' neural patterning ', ' multisensory ', ' Pain intensity ', ' clinical predictors ', ' neural correlate ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' hands-on learning ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' painful symptom ', ' pain symptom ', ' psychological symptom ', ' physical symptom ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' clinical pain ', ' patients with fibromyalgia ', ' fibromyalgia patients ', ' ']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,411201,0.251723508610004
"Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants Project Summary  In 2018, the World Health Organization reported 15 million (>1 in 10) preterm births with rising annual rates. 50% of preterm infants suffer from neurodevelopmental impairments, and all preterm infants experience high volumes of painful procedures as part of medical care. Preterm music intervention shows immediate physiologic improvements in heart rate and oxygen saturation, as well as improved physiologic responses to pain. What remains unknown is how music impacts preterm brain maturation, neurodevelopment, and pain responses in preterm infants. We propose a R61 project to explore biological mechanisms of music based intervention (MBI) on preterm brain maturation and neurodevelopment using electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs). EEG captures electrical potential oscillations of the brain which yields valuable information about brain function. Serial EEGs can track brain maturation in preterm infants. ERPs quantify electrical brain potentials changes time-locked with a stimulus. ERPs at 1 month corrected age test recognition memory function and cognitive processing and offers another objective measure to study the early effects of the MBI’s on neurodevelopment. The R61 will also explore the behavioral processes underlying effects of MBI on pain using EEG and the premature infant pain profile (PIPP). In preterm infants, central EEG amplitudes change when time-locked to a painful stimulus and PIPP scores scale pain responses with painful procedures. Specific recorded lullabies with simple arpeggiated accompaniment will be played for 6 weeks in a small randomized, blinded, controlled study of 50 medically stable 30 week preterms. Exploratory R61 findings will be assessed by specific Go/NoGo milestones that provide insight into the effects of MBI on biological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment and behavioral processes underlying pain. By achieving one of the Go/NoGo milestones, the proposal progresses to the R33 proof of concept pilot clinical trial with an additional 100 randomized subjects that will assess two primary outcomes measures: 1) MBI effects on Late Neurodevelopment using Bayley’s III neurodevelopmental testing at 6 month corrected age, and 2) Cumulative effects of MBI on Pain Response using longitudinal comparisons of baseline PIPP scores and final PIPP scores after 4 weeks of MBI. Secondary measures would explore more nuanced aspects of neurodevelopment: 1) MBI effects on brain maturation with expanded analyses of EEG-sleep components; 2) repeat ERP analysis at 6 months corrected age with expanded memory and cognitive testing (additional mismatch negativity paradigms); and pain response: 3) MBI effects on pain related EEG responses with comparative analyses of central EEG amplitude changes to the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Project Narrative This project addresses the following public health concerns: 1) high rates of neurodevelopmental impairments from preterm birth and 2) detrimental neurodevelopmental sequelae as a result of current preterm pain management regimens. We will initiate a two phased pilot clinical trial (randomized, double blinded, controlled) to support mechanistic research on the effects of music based intervention on neurodevelopment and pain response in preterm infants, with the second phase, as a proof of concept clinical trial evaluating the effects of music based intervention on late neurodevelopment and the cumulative effects of music on pain response. The public health relevance of this study is to provide groundbreaking results on effects of music based intervention in preterm infant health to inform future strategies on music research, given that music intervention is low risk, minimally invasive with a high potential health impact.",Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants,10016175,R61AT010712,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Memory ', ' Music ', ' Music Therapy ', ' Neonatology ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' rapid eye movement ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' statistics ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Health ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' memory recognition ', ' electrical potential ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Sleep Wake Cycle ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Regimen ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R61,2020,394707,0.3164614551418875
"A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well- designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short- term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self- monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2: To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.). Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact. Project Narrative Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve pain control with less opioid use in patients with sickle cell disease by promoting an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises, named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Building on the successes of our prior formative studies to develop the intervention and study protocol, we now propose a well-designed, appropriately powered study to test effects of YCWS on stress, pain, and opioid use in adults with sickle cell disease. Findings will be useful for advancing the use of relaxation/distraction exercises in future intervention studies among patients with sickle cell disease.",A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease,10050181,R01NR018848,"['Absenteeism ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Measurement ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' non-drug therapy ', ' non-drug treatment ', ' nondrug treatment ', ' nondrug therapy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' distraction ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' overdose death ', ' Pain intensity ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' guided discovery ', ' guided inquiry ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' recruit ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' pain self-management ', ' clinical pain ', ' morphine equivalence ', ' morphine equivalent ', ' experimental group ', ' side effect ', ' opioid sparing ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,524332,0.3692744577918126
"Developing A Mouse Chronic Pain Scale by 3D Imaging and Measurement of Mouse Spontaneous Behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY Rodent models are highly valuable for elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of chronic pain. Because rodents cannot articulate their sensation, “pain-like” behaviors have been used as the proxy. However, sensitivity and specificity of many existing methods for measuring rodent “pain” sensation, especially “chronic pain”, are uncertain. Here we propose to explore the feasibility of a largely automated and data-driven behavioral assay for identifying spontaneous pain in freely behaving mice. Specifically, we will take advantage of recent advances in 3D motion analysis, which enable precise and robust measurements of movements without human intervention, to extract movement features from freely moving mice in various pain states (baseline, induced acute pain, chronic pain, and with painkiller treatment). We will generate a database of movement features of control mice and mice with induced acute cheek/leg pain or chronic neuropathic cheek/leg pain, using both sexes of two mouse strains. We will then use machine-learning algorithms to identify the best combination of movement features for predicting the pain state (a “mouse chronic pain scale”). These efforts are expected to produce a novel and objective method to assess spontaneous pain, a characteristic feature of chronic pain, in mice. This method can supplement our recent method in measurements of evoked responses (a “mouse acute pain scale”) to provide efficient, robust, and comprehensive assessments of pain-related rodent behaviors and facilitate mechanistic investigations of brain circuits in mediating and modulating pain. Our interdisciplinary team is well suited to complete these Aims, utilizing combined expertise in mouse somatosensory/pain system (PI Luo), behavioral, systems and computational neuroscience (PI Ding), and 3D imaging and computer vision (PI Park). PROJECT NARRATIVE Rodent models are highly valuable for understanding pain mechanisms and developing treatments for pain relief. The proposed work aims to establish a novel 3D method for imaging, annotating, and interpreting spontaneous pain-related behaviors in mice (a “mouse chronic pain scale”).

"Multi-Omic Biomarkers for Neuropathic Pain Secondary to Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Taxanes are among the most efficacious chemotherapeutic agents and are frequently used in the treatment of early stage and metastatic breast cancer, but are known to produce a pain condition known as chemotherapy- induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP). CIPNP is one of the primary dose-limiting toxicities of taxane administration. No diagnostic tool exists to identify patients that will develop CIPNP in response to taxane therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, this proposal seeks to develop biomarker signatures associated with taxane-induced neuropathic pain to 1) identify patients at risk for developing debilitating taxane neuropathic pain before chemotherapy is initiated and 2) to identify patients on treatment that are at risk of developing neuropathic pain and need dose adjustments to prevent the onset of symptoms. Our long-term goal is to identify biomarker signatures that can identify patients at high risk of developing taxane-induced CIPNP to enable personalized dose adjustments to minimize CIPNP and optimize therapeutic outcomes. During the R61 phase, we will perform genome-wide, epigenome-wide, miRNome-wide, and untargeted metabolome-wide associations of the 11-point pain-intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy 20- item (CIPN20), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS) scores for physical function, anxiety, depression, and pain interference to identify novel biomarkers associated with identifiable phenotypes (Aim 1A). Next, we will test panels of candidate mRNA and cytokine biomarkers for their association with NRS, CIPN20, PCS, and PROMIS scores (Aim 1B). An added strength of this study is that by collecting samples before, during, and after taxane treatment we will be able to compare those patients who develop CIPNP to those that remain pain free, providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism predisposing a patient to developing neuropathic pain. R61 milestones include developing biomarker signatures that identify patients at risk of developing neuropathic pain that compromise quality of life (i) before taxane therapy is started and (ii) over the time course of taxane therapy. One rationale is that some patients will have a detectable biomarker profile suggesting a high likelihood of long term (i.e., greater than 1 year) neuropathic pain and a need to either avoid or reduce taxane doses. A second rationale is that some patients may not have a biomarker signature indicating an adverse response to taxane therapy at baseline, but develop one through the course of taxane therapy. This biomarker signature will be used to detect these susceptible patients early and personalize their taxane therapy to minimize CIPNP. In the R33 phase (Aim 2), we will use machine learning to develop and validate algorithms using biomarker signatures from associations with phenotypic changes from Aim 1 (A and B) to predict individuals at risk of developing CIPNP and to identify patients who are at risk of developing an adverse profile as taxane therapy is administered. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because identification of validated biomarker signatures in taxane-treated breast cancer patients associated with increased likelihood of developing neuropathic pain may contribute to the development of novel approaches to personalize chemotherapy in patients, including altering dosing or using a different chemotherapeutic, reducing the risk for developing neuropathic pain and the development of novel approaches to treat or slow the progression of neuropathic pain by modifying pathways prior to taxane-treatment and before initiation of symptoms.

"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects.

"Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation - Renewal Postoperative pain is a major morbidity, and persistent opioid use after surgery has contributed to an epidemic. An improved mechanistic understanding of how pain is regulated within the brain can lead to novel non-opioid analgesic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the central regulation of postoperative pain. The objective of the current application is to define the role of prelimbic cortex (PL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two key components of the prefrontal cortex in rodents, in the regulation of acute and chronic postoperative pain. The PL is homologous to human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that is known to undergo synaptic changes with chronic pain, and the ACC is a well-described region for processing affective component of pain across species. Our central hypothesis is that an imbalance in neural activities in the PL and ACC contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain and thus forms a therapeutic target. Our hypothesis is supported by the current literature showing that the PL has a pain-inhibitory role, whereas the ACC enhances pain aversion, and that chronic pain causes increased excitability in the ACC and hypo-excitability in the PL. It is also supported by our recent results demonstrating that AMPAkines and ketamine, drugs that alter glutamate signaling and shape cortical circuits, reduce pain. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in ACC and PL activities contributes to postoperative pain in awake freely behaving rats. We will use paw incision (PI) to mimic acute reversible incisional pain, and spared nerve injury (SNI) to model chronic pain after intraoperative nerve damage. We will first correlate imbalanced prefrontal activities with pain, by showing a concurrent loss of nociceptive response in the PL and gain of response in the ACC as pain behavior persists, and the resolution of such neural changes as pain resolves, using simultaneous in vivo extracellular recordings of the PL and ACC. Further, to test the causal effect of this imbalance on pain, we will show that optogenetic PL activation, or ACC inhibition, reverses postoperative pain behaviors. Next, we will use optrode recordings to dissect a local pain- regulatory circuit fromthe PL to the ACC. Further, we will use an unbiased supervised machine learning analysis to validate the relationship between the imbalance in PL and ACC activities and the chronicity of postoperative pain. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic and electrical neuromodulation can target imbalanced PL/ACC activities in the postoperative pain state. We will show that AMPAkines and ketamine increase PL outputs and reduce ACC activities to inhibit pain and optimize the timing and dosing regimens for these drugs and test therapeutic synergy. We will also optimize invasive and non-invasive electrical stimulation protocols in the PL to treat pain. This project is innovative because it applies a new systems neuroscience approach with cutting-edge techniques to uncover a central pain-regulatory mechanism. The work is significant because it produces novel applications of FDA-approved drugs (ketamine and APMAkines) for postoperative pain and a blueprint for new deep brain or transcranial stimulation methods to treat pain. Precise understanding of the central mechanisms for postoperative pain is needed to develop novel analgesics and address the current opioid epidemic. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that an imbalance in neural activities in the prefrontal regions of the brain contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain. Further, we aim to define novel brain stimulation methods that target cortical mechanism for the treatment of postoperative pain in preclinical models, and test FDA-approved drugs such as ketamine and AMPkines as pain therapeutics based on their impact on cortical circuitry.",Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation -

"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial

"Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients The under-assessment of pain response is one of the primary barriers to the adequate treatment of pain in critically ill patients, and is associated with many negative outcomes. Nonetheless, many ICU patients are unable to self-report their pain intensity. Currently, behavioral pain scales are used to assess pain in nonverbal patients. Unfortunately, these scales require repetitive manual administration by overburdened nurses, and show variability in pain intensity ratings by nurses. Furthermore, manual pain assessment tools cannot monitor pain continuously and autonomously. The PIs’ long-term goal is to specify pain intensity in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of an autonomous, clinically- available pain assessment system by developing and validating pain recognition algorithms in a fully uncontrolled ICU setting. The central hypothesis is we can autonomously assess facial pain expressions and patient activity. The rationale is that autonomous pain quantification can reduce nurse workload and can enable real-time pain monitoring. Contextualization of pain with respect to patient function can also lead to improved functional and clinical outcomes. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims. (1) Developing and validating a pervasive sensing system in two 24-beds ICUs (ICU) to determine if deep learning algorithms can accurately assess pain facial expressions from image data, when compared to existing assessment tools. (2) Developing and validating algorithms for pain contextualization using autonomous activity recognition. The approach is innovative, because it departs from status quo by autonomously assessing pain and functional status in the ICU. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and barriers in critical care, including manual repetitive ICU assessments and lack of granular and continuous pain and function measures. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. The proposed research is relevant to NIBIB mission to improve health by leading the development of biomedical technologies, as the proposed research develops advanced computational methods and uses sensing technologies to automatically assess patient pain and function.",Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients,9856443,R21EB027344,"['Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Beds ', ' Color ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Equipment ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Face Pain ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Fostering ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Pain Assessment Tool ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' To specify ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NIBIB ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' recruit ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' pain patient ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ventilation ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,218825,0.5424486878420242
