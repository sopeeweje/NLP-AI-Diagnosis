"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT This project has three aims.  The first is development, refinement, and testing of an explicit theory of language acquisition in children.  The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSIS IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN I propose to continue my explorations of parallel distributed processing models of cognitive processes.

"LANGUAGE LEARNING AND LANGUAGE INPUT The purpose of the program of research outlined in this grant proposal is to determine how child and adult language learners use the linguistic environment in acquiring the formal structure of a language.  The relation between linguistic input and learning will be investigated in two major areas.  The first area concerns the nature and role of linguistic feedback in first language acquisition: what type of feedback exists naturally; what type of feedback, when used experimentally, accelerates acquisition? The second area concerns how beginning learners, whether they are two-year-olds acquiring their native language or adults acquiring an artificial language, map out the basic pattern of a language.  The project will investigate the roles played by two different variables:  very high-frequency syntactic markers, and reference.  A variety of methods and a range of subject populations will be utilized.  Computer-assisted analysis of natural conversations between two-year-olds and their mothers will be used to investigate whether parents supply children with linguistically useful replies.  A training study will investigate experimentally the facilitating effects of different kinds of feedback on two- years-olds' acquisition of questions; a similar study will investigate different types of feedback to adults learning an artificial language.  Experimental studies of artificial language learning with older children and adults, investigating the role of reference and syntactic markers, will be performed.  Computer modeling of adult language learning will be used to examine different hypotheses of how adult and child learning of phrases occurs.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theory of language learning which will specify just how learners utilize environmental cues.  Our work should have implications for learning theory within language, and should also have implications for how to accelerate acquisition among the language-delayed and among second-language learners.

"LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION The present proposal addresses the question of how people comprehend sentences that they read or hear.  Its long-range goal is to develop a theory of how people use knowledge of their language to structure world into mental representation that can then be interpreted semantically.  The proposed research is designed to uncover the principles that govern readers' and listeners' use of grammatical information in sentence parsing, and is predicated upon the assumption that these principles will form a distinct subset of the principles that govern cognition in general.  Three specific topics are addressed in the proposed research:  (a) the applicability across languages of principles of phrase structure parsing we and our colleagues have identified in previous research; (b) the possible existence of differences in how argument phrases and adjunct phrases are parsed; and (c) the nature of the mental representation or representations of a sentence that are constructed during sentence comprehension.  The research will use a variety of experimental techniques, testing normal adult humans on the speed with which they read sentences, the speed and accuracy with which they make judgments about sentences, and the effects that reading or hearing sentences have upon tasks performed concurrently with reading or listening.  Our research is designed to contribute to the development of psycholinguistic theory.  Recent advances in psycholinguistic theory have had a major impact on the analysis of language disorders, especially the aphasias.  We look forward to the time when these new analyses will lead to improved treatments and we hope to contribute to the psycholinguistic theory that fuels the increase in our understanding of language disorders.

"COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CHILD LANGUAGE TRANSCRIPT DATA The CHILDES Project provides three crucial tools now being used by language researchers around the world.  The first tool is the CHILDES database of computerized transcripts from interactions between children and their parent.  This database includes data from earlier funded projects studying children from a variety of social groups, ages, languages, and medical conditions.  These data are made available to all researchers.  The second major tool is the CHAT transcription format which is used to encode the current database and new data being entered into the system.  The third major tool is the CLAN package of data analysis programs which can be used to automatically search the entire database for lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns relevant to key questions in developmental theory.  For the next funding period, the specific aims of the CHILDES project involve five major initiatives that seek to expand and refine the shapes of these three tools.  1.  The database initiative.  In this area, the goal is to improve the quality and quantity of the existing CHILDES database through additional data entry, detailed documentation, computer-assisted checking, and reformatting.  2.  The Johnny Appleseed initiative.  The goal of this initiative     is to make all three CHILDES tools maximally available to language researchers around the world.  3.  The user-friendliness initiative.  Here the goal is increase     the user-friendliness of the CLAN programs for UNIX, PC-DOS,     and Macintosh by bundling the programs into a single menu- driven application for all three systems.  4.  The discourse initiative.  The goal here is to create a set   of CLAN programs that will facilitate study of narrative and conversational discourse patterns.  5.  The morphosyntactic initiative.  Here the goal is to expand   the e- morph and LAG systems to provide automatic morphological analyses and computer-assisted part-of-speech   tagging and synaptic parsing of sentences.

Its long-range goal is to develop a theory of how people use knowledge of their language to structure world into mental representation that can then be interpreted semantically.  The proposed research is designed to uncover the principles that govern readers' and listeners' use of grammatical information in sentence parsing, and is predicated upon the assumption that these principles will form a distinct subset of the principles that govern cognition in general.  Three specific topics are addressed in the proposed research:  (a) the applicability across languages of principles of phrase structure parsing we and our colleagues have identified in previous research; (b) the possible existence of differences in how argument phrases and adjunct phrases are parsed; and (c) the nature of the mental representation or representations of a sentence that are constructed during sentence comprehension.  The research will use a variety of experimental techniques, testing normal adult humans on the speed with which they read sentences, the speed and accuracy with which they make judgments about sentences, and the effects that reading or hearing sentences have upon tasks performed concurrently with reading or listening.  Our research is designed to contribute to the development of psycholinguistic theory.  Recent advances in psycholinguistic theory have had a major impact on the analysis of language disorders, especially the aphasias.  We look forward to the time when these new analyses will lead to improved treatments and we hope to contribute to the psycholinguistic theory that fuels the increase in our understanding of language disorders.

"COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CHILD LANGUAGE TRANSCRIPT DATA The CHILDES Project provides three crucial tools now being used by language researchers around the world.  The first tool is the CHILDES database of computerized transcripts from interactions between children and their parent.  This database includes data from earlier funded projects studying children from a variety of social groups, ages, languages, and medical conditions.  These data are made available to all researchers.  The second major tool is the CHAT transcription format which is used to encode the current database and new data being entered into the system.  The third major tool is the CLAN package of data analysis programs which can be used to automatically search the entire database for lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns relevant to key questions in developmental theory.  For the next funding period, the specific aims of the CHILDES project involve five major initiatives that seek to expand and refine the shapes of these three tools.  1.  The database initiative.  In this area, the goal is to improve the quality and quantity of the existing CHILDES database through additional data entry, detailed documentation, computer-assisted checking, and reformatting.  2.  The Johnny Appleseed initiative.  The goal of this initiative     is to make all three CHILDES tools maximally available to language researchers around the world.  3.  The user-friendliness initiative.

"MATURATIONAL CHANGE IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION CAPACITY The present research program examines the developmental changes which occur in the capacity for acquiring language. More specifically, it examines what appears to be a sensitive period for the acquisition of the grammar of a language. The first part of this research program is descriptive. Four studied are proposed to investigate the structural parameters and reliability of this effect using a population of second language learners of varying ages. An additional study will evaluate the uniqueness of this effect for language by testing for age differences in music learning. The second part of this program is experimental. It will explore some of the changes that occur in the learning mechanism over development which may underlie and explain the descriptive phenomena. In particular it will explore possible child-adult differences in the use of the operating principles used to convert speech input into stored data. Seven studies are proposed. In each study, two groups of children of the ages of 6-7 and 10-11 years and one group of adults will be asked to learn a miniature artificial language. The miniature language will be designed to test the effects of morphological properties (including position, frequency, stress and structure) on the success and patterning of subjects' learning. In addition to documenting developmental changes in the use of these operating principles, some studies will test for the influence of first language typology on the use of such principles.  Understanding age related changes in language learning capacity has important implications for educating the deaf (who are often not exposed to a native language at birth) and educating the many newly arriving child and adult immigrants to the United States. Such information will ultimately help us to develop educational opportunities tailored to the particular qualities inherent in different aged learners.

"SOFTWARE FOR VERB BASED EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION Delays in language acquisition are the most prevalent developmental problem      in preschool children.  The acquisition of verbs poses a special challenge       for children with language problems, perhaps because verbs are richly            endowed with syntactic and semantic information and play a central role in       the development of grammatical competency.  We plan to develop and publish       a microcomputer-based system designed to facilitate the development of a         rich verb lexicon in children at risk for chronic language disorders.  The       curriculum will be based on linguistic research indicating a central role        for verbs in language acquisition.  The system will feature animation,           digital speech, interface options for special needs, and an intelligent          computer-aided training (JCAT) system that uses artificial intelligence to       generate individualized intervention strategies.  The system will include        modules designed to increase the size and diversity of the verb lexicon,         increase semantic and syntactic accuracy, and promote the proper use of          inflected verb forms.  Our Phase II objectives are to (a) develop                additional program modules for children at various stages of language            development, (b) field test, improve, and validate the effectiveness of          program components, and (c) integrate all components with the ICAT system.

"SOFTWARE INTERVENTION FOR ADVANCED SYNTAX DEVELOPMENT Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Remarkably, two thirds of children identified as specific language impaired upon entry into school have neither been identified previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years.  Given this large number of school-age children with previously unidentified language impairments, there is a clear need to develop intervention programs designed specifically to meet the needs of this population, i.e., intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions that are generally missing from the grammar of these children.  We propose to develop language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old). The curriculum will be derived from contemporary linguistics as described by the Principles and Parameters Model of Universal Grammar, which suggests important ways in which the treatment of children with language disrobers may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved.  The software will include an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies.  Our Phase I objective is to develop prototype software for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators.

"INTERNET INTERVENTION TO PREVENT LANGUAGE DISORDERS Language delay is pervasive among preschool children. Early detection and preventative intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be cumulative, yet research shows that language intervention is not usually provided.

"EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION VIA THE INTERNET Language delay is pervasive among preschool children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative, yet research shows that most preschoolers do not receive language intervention services.

The curricular design will be based on contemporary linguistic research. On-line delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks ongoing performance. By combining Internet accessibility with centralized curricular control and data collection, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies. It will also be possible to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. Our Phase I goal is to test the feasibility and technical merit of our plans.

"Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A great deal of work in sentence                processing over the years has dealt with the question of whether contextual          information can guide language processing. There is by now considerable              evidence that suggests that some kinds of information from the discourse             context have immediate effects. However, the question of how these effects           occur has remained largely ignored. The studies in this proposal focus on the        discourse properties of modified definite noun phrases. Work in sentence             processing has shown that the resolution of ambiguities in which one of the          possible readings involves noun modification is affected by the availability of      a discourse model in which the modificational phrase serves to distinguish           between two possible referents. A central question is whether such discourse         effects found with modifiers reflect a general, conventionalized property of         modification, or whether they are more aptly characterized as a more subtle          system based on expectations regarding typical usages. A series of studies is        proposed to investigate the hypothesis that a typical default expression exists      for neutral (i.e., non-contrastive) contexts, and that the use of a more             informative expression signals a contrastive function in the discourse, with         immediate processing consequences. Data will come from elicited production           tasks, on-line comprehension experiments which monitor subjects' eye movements       to a visual array in response to spoken linguistic stimuli, traditional reading      time studies, and prosodic analyses in a read-aloud task. The current proposal       represents a significant departure from existing work in two salient ways:           First, it attempts to provide a detailed investigation into the nature of the        referential effects, using a methodology that is especially well-suited for          studying referential aspects of language.

"Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A great deal of work in sentence                processing over the years has dealt with the question of whether contextual          information can guide language processing. There is by now considerable              evidence that suggests that some kinds of information from the discourse             context have immediate effects. However, the question of how these effects           occur has remained largely ignored. The studies in this proposal focus on the        discourse properties of modified definite noun phrases. Work in sentence             processing has shown that the resolution of ambiguities in which one of the          possible readings involves noun modification is affected by the availability of      a discourse model in which the modificational phrase serves to distinguish           between two possible referents. A central question is whether such discourse         effects found with modifiers reflect a general, conventionalized property of         modification, or whether they are more aptly characterized as a more subtle          system based on expectations regarding typical usages. A series of studies is        proposed to investigate the hypothesis that a typical default expression exists      for neutral (i.e., non-contrastive) contexts, and that the use of a more             informative expression signals a contrastive function in the discourse, with         immediate processing consequences. Data will come from elicited production           tasks, on-line comprehension experiments which monitor subjects' eye movements       to a visual array in response to spoken linguistic stimuli, traditional reading      time studies, and prosodic analyses in a read-aloud task. The current proposal       represents a significant departure from existing work in two salient ways:           First, it attempts to provide a detailed investigation into the nature of the        referential effects, using a methodology that is especially well-suited for          studying referential aspects of language.

"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).

"Early Language Intervention via the Internet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test an Internet-based language intervention system designed to promote language development in preschool children with language disorders. Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support. By combining easy access via the Internet with centralized data collection and curricular control, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies, and to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. In Phase I we tested the feasibility and technical merit of this objective. A prototype program module was developed and tested with 23 students who were enrolled in an Early Essential Education program, including 19 preschoolers with language delays.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         ",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,6733239,R01DC005241,"['biomedical automation ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' computer data analysis ', ' computer simulation ', ' human subject ', ' semantics ', ' communication behavior ', ' face expression ', ' paralinguistic behavior ', ' sign language ', ' communication disorder aid ', ' videotape /videodisc ', ' information system ', ' video recording system ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' phonology ', ' computational biology ', ' ']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,499766,0.09894369548579147

"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence. The product of the second goal will be a better understanding of the information required for accurate detection of respiratory related conditions from text and useful tools for automatically extracting that information. Third, she will teach, promote, and facilitate the use of natural language processing in the biomedical informatics field. The product of the third goal will be a graduate class surveying medical language processing methodology and applications and development of general tools sets for researchers who need encoded data from textual patient records.        The proposed research will focus on:   Aim 1. Development and evaluation of a respiratory case detection model;   Aim 2. Integration of existing natural language processing tools and development of new methodologies for extracting clinical conditions needed for respiratory case detection from textual records; and   Aim 3.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development.

"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition. The work also can inform language therapies for brain injured patients in several ways. First, sources of production difficulty are precisely investigated, as are accommodations that unimpaired speakers make in the face of this difficulty. Second, the project investigates the relationship between prior experience with a syntactic construction and comprehension difficulty, which can have implications for the amount and nature of practice that should be provided to patients to improve their comprehension of certain sentence types.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           ","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7298428,R01HD056029,"['Cues ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Ear structure ', ' Ear ', ' Environment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Age-Months ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Poaceae ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Procedures ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Data Quality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Play ', ' Shapes ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Statistical Study ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Class ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' fenson ', ' p-chlorophenyl benzenesulfonate ', ' 4-chlorophenyl benzenesulfonate ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' lexical ', ' haptics ', ' emotional experience ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' ']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2007,217951,0.08211342386875861
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this proposal. Three general questions guide the research. (1) What are the constraints on language learning mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if 'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned. Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over inconsistency at all. In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition.         ",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7212176,R01HD048572,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Computer information processing ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Numbers ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Animals ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stem ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,186741,0.2416709387951393
"When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research project is to employ behavioral and computational methods to better understand how infants use multiple regularities when learning language. Many researchers have posited that infants use statistical learning mechanisms to extract these regularities. However, the majority of this work focuses on infants' abilities to exploit a single regularity. In their natural environment, infants receive input that contains many overlapping regularities of varying consistency. Little research has focused on how infants process this type of input. In order to make use of the cues available in natural input, infants must be able to exploit these overlapping probabilistic regularities. The first aim of this grant is to explore how infants use multiple regularities to find words in fluent speech. By 9 months, infants are able to robustly use both lexical stress and sequential statistics to segment words. However, prior research has focused on how infants use these regularities in isolation, or how weighting of the cues changes developmentally. We hypothesize that infants can use these cues for word segmentation when they are probabilistic and overlapping, as they are in natural languages such as English. The second aim is to investigate the effect of multiple regularities on word learning. As a child's vocabulary grows, regularities arise among the labels and referents they know, as well as within the mappings between labels and referents. These regularities may affect the acquisition of new words. However, their potential role in subsequent word learning has not been carefully explored. Using computational models, we can examine these issues by carefully controlling regularities that exist within a vocabulary and by exploring how different types of regularities may affect word learning. These models can lead to a deeper understanding of these processing mechanisms and to novel predictions, which can then be tested in behavioral experiments.    Public Health Interests:  The goal of this research is to better understand how typically developing infants learn language - in particular, how they use the many patterns that exist in natural languages to do so. The ability to make use of multiple regularities likely affects infants' skills at language learning. By better understanding how this process unfolds in typically developing infants, researchers will be able to investigate how children with language delays and disabilities may differ in their ability to integrate multiple cues. In the future, this information will be useful for developing treatment plans.           ",When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition,7286034,F31DC008737,"['Cues ', ' Environment ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' Grant ', ' Depth ', ' Infant ', ' Body of uterus ', ' Uterine Body ', ' Corpus Uteri ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Probability ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' neural network (computer simulation of nervous system) ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Networks (Computer) ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' lexical ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2007,31498,0.1696348700115303
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports.

"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           ",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7486009,F32HD055703,"['Critiques ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Loudness ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Numbers ', ' Methods ', ' Phonetics ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' Auditory system ', ' experience ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Toddler ', ' Categories ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,49646,0.2153200374148323
"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          ",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7408311,F32HD057698,"['Cues ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Categories ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,46826,0.18511866107488706
"When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research project is to employ behavioral and computational methods to better understand how infants use multiple regularities when learning language. Many researchers have posited that infants use statistical learning mechanisms to extract these regularities. However, the majority of this work focuses on infants' abilities to exploit a single regularity. In their natural environment, infants receive input that contains many overlapping regularities of varying consistency. Little research has focused on how infants process this type of input. In order to make use of the cues available in natural input, infants must be able to exploit these overlapping probabilistic regularities. The first aim of this grant is to explore how infants use multiple regularities to find words in fluent speech. By 9 months, infants are able to robustly use both lexical stress and sequential statistics to segment words. However, prior research has focused on how infants use these regularities in isolation, or how weighting of the cues changes developmentally. We hypothesize that infants can use these cues for word segmentation when they are probabilistic and overlapping, as they are in natural languages such as English. The second aim is to investigate the effect of multiple regularities on word learning. As a child's vocabulary grows, regularities arise among the labels and referents they know, as well as within the mappings between labels and referents. These regularities may affect the acquisition of new words. However, their potential role in subsequent word learning has not been carefully explored. Using computational models, we can examine these issues by carefully controlling regularities that exist within a vocabulary and by exploring how different types of regularities may affect word learning. These models can lead to a deeper understanding of these processing mechanisms and to novel predictions, which can then be tested in behavioral experiments.    Public Health Interests:  The goal of this research is to better understand how typically developing infants learn language - in particular, how they use the many patterns that exist in natural languages to do so. The ability to make use of multiple regularities likely affects infants' skills at language learning. By better understanding how this process unfolds in typically developing infants, researchers will be able to investigate how children with language delays and disabilities may differ in their ability to integrate multiple cues. In the future, this information will be useful for developing treatment plans.           ",When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition,7488931,F31DC008737,"['Cues ', ' Environment ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' Grant ', ' Depth ', ' Infant ', ' Body of uterus ', ' Uterine Body ', ' Corpus Uteri ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Probability ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' neural network (computer simulation of nervous system) ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Networks (Computer) ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' lexical ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2008,31498,0.1696348700115303
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development.

"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition. The work also can inform language therapies for brain injured patients in several ways. First, sources of production difficulty are precisely investigated, as are accommodations that unimpaired speakers make in the face of this difficulty. Second, the project investigates the relationship between prior experience with a syntactic construction and comprehension difficulty, which can have implications for the amount and nature of practice that should be provided to patients to improve their comprehension of certain sentence types.

"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          ",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7470513,R01DC005650,"['Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Secondary to ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Habits ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' implicit memory ', ' procedural memory ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' abstracting ', ' Modeling ', ' motor skill learning ', ' perceptual motor learning ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' visual process ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,307451,0.1687159988044753
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively.

"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be  conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the  input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our  understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and  ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition.

"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          ",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7659525,R01DC005650,"['Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Secondary to ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Habits ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Reading ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' implicit memory ', ' procedural memory ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' abstracting ', ' Modeling ', ' motor skill learning ', ' perceptual motor learning ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' visual process ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,308285,0.1687159988044753
"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             ",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7678067,F31DC009936,"['Cues ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Intention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Phase ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Body of uterus ', ' Uterine Body ', ' Corpus Uteri ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Morphology ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' specific language impairment ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Walking ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Competence ', ' theories ', ' model design ', ' Coupled ', ' lexical ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2009,28830,0.31111394252221297

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain.

"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          ",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7583888,F32HD057698,"['Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' natural language ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,50054,0.18511866107488706
"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           ",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7600444,F32HD055703,"['Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory ', ' Critiques ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Loudness ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Phonetics ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Pattern ', ' Auditory system ', ' experience ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Toddler ', ' Categories ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' natural language ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,22393,0.2153200374148323

"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          ",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7897798,R01DC005650,"['Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Secondary to ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Habits ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Reading ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' implicit memory ', ' procedural memory ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' abstracting ', ' Modeling ', ' motor skill learning ', ' perceptual motor learning ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' visual process ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,197110,0.1687159988044753
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders. By focusing research on a mechanism that is thought to play a significant role in language acquisition, we may help to reveal potential deficits and means to identify infants who are at risk of developing lasting language problems.           Relevance The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             ",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7908812,F31DC009936,"['Cues ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Intention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Phase ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Morphology ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' specific language impairment ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Walking ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Competence ', ' theories ', ' model design ', ' Coupled ', ' lexical ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,29034,0.31111394252221297
"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           ","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7870420,R01HD056029,"['Cues ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Ear structure ', ' Ear ', ' Environment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Age-Months ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Poaceae ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Procedures ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Data Quality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Play ', ' Shapes ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' fenson ', ' p-chlorophenyl benzenesulfonate ', ' 4-chlorophenyl benzenesulfonate ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' lexical ', ' haptics ', ' emotional experience ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' ']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2010,184005,0.08211342386875861
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Public Health Relevance Statement  Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Public Health Relevance Statement  Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.           The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           ","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",8094445,R01HD056029,"['Poaceae ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Ear structure ', ' Ear ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Age-Months ', ' simulation ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Behavior ', ' insight ', ' interest ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Infant ', ' Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Solutions ', ' Names ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Literature ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Visual ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Age-Years ', ' statistics ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Grant ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Resolution ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Event ', ' Data Quality ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' lexical ', ' novel ', ' Cues ', ' Time ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Attention ', ' Data ', ' Testing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Measures ', ' programs ', ' Nature ', ' Laboratories ', ' Shapes ', ' Area ', ' Structure ', ' Environment ', ' base ', ' Investigation ', ' Play ', ' social ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Process ', ' Methods ', ' Individual ', ' Goals ', ' Knowledge ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' emotional experience ', ' haptics ', ' Empirical Research ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' ']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2011,176482,0.08211342386875861
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Neural predictors of language acquisition after intensive behavioral intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.           Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             ",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,8097952,F31DC009936,"['Information Distribution ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Semantics ', ' Walking ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Stream ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Competence ', ' lexical ', ' Coupled ', ' instrument ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Structure ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Techniques ', ' Cues ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Complex ', ' Goals ', ' Intention ', ' Elements ', ' Phase ', ' theories ', ' Infant ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Testing ', ' Knowledge ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Behavioral ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Address ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Morphology ', ' Work ', ' Process ', ' Research ', ' base ', ' Probability ', ' sound ', ' Learning ', ' Play ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' specific language impairment ', ' model design ', ' phrases ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2011,14727,0.31111394252221297
"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.          This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.              Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.       This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates.

"Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulties learning words, which negatively impacts academic performance, functional independence, and quality of life. Despite the importance of vocabulary development, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits. Furthermore, the overlap of language characteristics in children with ASD and SLI is not well understood. An understanding of language-learning mechanisms in children with ASD and SLI has important theoretical implications upon which effective language therapies rely. Although statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is accpted as a robust language-learning mechanism in multiple domains of language in typical development, very little is known about statistical learning in children with ASD and SLI. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning in word learning. Specifically, this study will assess how children link knowledge of native language sound patterns to meaning. The contribution of statistical learning in word learning in children with atypical language development will be assessed through three studies. Specific Aim 1 will investigate prerequisite skills in word learning. Study 1a will assess the use of statistical learnng through a segmenting task (i.e., segmenting sound units from a continuous speech stream with the use of implicit transitional probability cues) without word learning. Study 1b will test associative word learning of novel labels paired with novel objects without segmentation. Because children with ASD and SLI have difficulties learning words and have difficulties consolidating linguistic information in word learning, it is important to test component skills in word learning. Once prerequisite skills have been assessed, Study 2, addressing specific aim 2, will assess whether children with ASD and SLI are able to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and specific aim 2 is anticipated; however, comparison among the different groups will allow for identification of potentially different abilities in word learning skills in the two populations with atypical language development. Both implicit and explicit teaching and testing methods will be used to capture subtle real-time learning information while placing minimal behavioral demands on the children. Within- and between- group analyses will assess learning in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development. New statistical methods for analyzing eye-gaze data will be employed to address potential analytical difficulties given the heterogeneity and possible lack of within-subject stability in children with ASD and SLI. Additionally, because of known social deficits in children with ASD, the studies will use non-social tasks. Findings from this study will contribute important information to our theoretical understanding of language acquisition in children with atypical language development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI). Specifically, this study will evaluate two prerequisite skills for word learning, segmenting sounds into word-like units and mapping novel labels onto novel objects, to assess the ability to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A comparison of abilities in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development will be conducted to assess whether similar abilities underlie word learning across different populations, which will have important implications for theories of language development in children with ASD and SLI.                ",Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders,8594469,F31DC013485,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Bees ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Probability ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Label ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' gaze ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2013,29355,0.15568603093778444
"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8522948,F31DC013204,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Trainings ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' aphasic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Agrammatism ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Acquired Language Disorders ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' sequence learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' public health relevance ', ' aphasia rehabilitation ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,34908,0.2189409788919904
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.          Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.                ",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8804757,K02NS089852,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diffusion ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Fostering ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' motor deficit ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Motor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter injury ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2014,191131,0.11400177446715715
"Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulties learning words, which negatively impacts academic performance, functional independence, and quality of life. Despite the importance of vocabulary development, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits. Furthermore, the overlap of language characteristics in children with ASD and SLI is not well understood. An understanding of language-learning mechanisms in children with ASD and SLI has important theoretical implications upon which effective language therapies rely. Although statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is accpted as a robust language-learning mechanism in multiple domains of language in typical development, very little is known about statistical learning in children with ASD and SLI. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning in word learning. Specifically, this study will assess how children link knowledge of native language sound patterns to meaning. The contribution of statistical learning in word learning in children with atypical language development will be assessed through three studies. Specific Aim 1 will investigate prerequisite skills in word learning. Study 1a will assess the use of statistical learnng through a segmenting task (i.e., segmenting sound units from a continuous speech stream with the use of implicit transitional probability cues) without word learning. Study 1b will test associative word learning of novel labels paired with novel objects without segmentation. Because children with ASD and SLI have difficulties learning words and have difficulties consolidating linguistic information in word learning, it is important to test component skills in word learning. Once prerequisite skills have been assessed, Study 2, addressing specific aim 2, will assess whether children with ASD and SLI are able to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and specific aim 2 is anticipated; however, comparison among the different groups will allow for identification of potentially different abilities in word learning skills in the two populations with atypical language development. Both implicit and explicit teaching and testing methods will be used to capture subtle real-time learning information while placing minimal behavioral demands on the children. Within- and between- group analyses will assess learning in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development. New statistical methods for analyzing eye-gaze data will be employed to address potential analytical difficulties given the heterogeneity and possible lack of within-subject stability in children with ASD and SLI. Additionally, because of known social deficits in children with ASD, the studies will use non-social tasks. Findings from this study will contribute important information to our theoretical understanding of language acquisition in children with atypical language development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI). Specifically, this study will evaluate two prerequisite skills for word learning, segmenting sounds into word-like units and mapping novel labels onto novel objects, to assess the ability to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A comparison of abilities in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development will be conducted to assess whether similar abilities underlie word learning across different populations, which will have important implications for theories of language development in children with ASD and SLI.                ",Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders,8667313,F31DC013485,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Bees ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Probability ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Label ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' gaze ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2014,27926,0.15568603093778444
"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8642022,F31DC013204,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Trainings ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' aphasic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Agrammatism ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Acquired Language Disorders ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' sequence learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' public health relevance ', ' aphasia rehabilitation ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,35352,0.2189409788919904
"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.                ",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,8714196,F32HD080306,"['thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2014,57782,0.25158891990752535
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants.

"Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The acquisition of language is essential for normal functioning, and problems with language acquisition can severely limit an individual's educational, career, and social opportunities. One mechanism thought to play a critical role in language acquisition is statistical learning, which refers to the process of extracting subtle patterns from environmental input. Although it is commonly assumed that statistical learning operates implicitly, without requiring conscious effort or awareness, this fundamental assumption has not been directly tested. It is possible that inducing statistical learning to occur explicitly rather than implicitly may engage additional explicit memory systems and may also facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation processes that are critical for long-term retention. The goal of the proposed research is to assess whether and how learning mode alters the memory systems and sleep-dependent consolidation processes that support statistical learning.  In the first proposed study, the effect of learning mode on the memory systems recruited for statistical learning will be evaluated, using a combination of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses. In the second proposed study, the effect of learning mode on sleep-dependent consolidation of statistical representations will be assessed, using a combination of behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. Because patients often show dissociations of implicit and explicit memory, understanding how learning mode may modulate the memory systems and subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning could have tremendous potential to inform treatments for language disorders. For example, by manipulating learning mode, therapies may be developed to selectively target one memory system in order to compensate for dysfunctions in the other, or to promote sleep-dependent consolidation.  The proposed fellowship training will provide instruction in two main methodological areas: (1) sleep neurobiology and (2) fMRI analyses. Training in these two different areas will be integrated by the common goal of understanding how learning mode alters the memory systems and consolidation processes that support statistical learning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Difficulties with language acquisition are characteristic of a wide range of disorders, such as specific language impairment and autism, and present a major barrier to normal functioning.

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.                ",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,8850708,F32HD080306,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2015,60542,0.25158891990752535
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8934210,K02NS089852,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diffusion ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Fostering ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' motor deficit ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Motor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter injury ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2015,191131,0.11400177446715715
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.","Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys",8851635,R01HD067250,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Football ', ' Manufactured football ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Parents ', ' Phonetics ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Tamarins ', ' Saguinus ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Soccer ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Rivers ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Head Movements ', ' Hour ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' British ', ' Performance ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Sum ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' lexical ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,208800,0.16161665002371312
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.",Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism,8841825,K23MH094517,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Day Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rest ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' cooking ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' investigator training ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral disorder ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' joint attention ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,181319,0.1797047422784482
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Medical ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' Applaud ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' health data ', ' clinical investigation ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' terabyte ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,0.13560281829076917
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9255906,F31DC015370,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' farmer ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' natural language ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' comprehension deficit ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2016,31612,0.3139044222443263
"Neural Systems For Infant Sensitivity to Phonological Rhythmic-Temporal Patterning  PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to understand how all infants discover the finite set of language units in their native language from the infinite combinations of sensory stimuli around them. Specifically, we explore whether infants are sensitive to the pure timing of the stimuli (the frequency), or whether they also are sensitive to linguistic information within the stimuli (alternation of phonetic-syllabic units). The findings will help us better understand [[on a modality-free level]] how infants begin life with brain mechanisms predisposed for discovering the core [[phonological]] parts of their languages, and how we can support clinicians in identifying infants at risk for phonology-based language and reading disorders.",Neural Systems For Infant Sensitivity to Phonological Rhythmic-Temporal Patterning,9193903,F31HD087085,[''],NICHD,GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.17240532942995343
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9172394,R01DC015642,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cleaved ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,606922,0.30284283476609286
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,9116243,F32HD080306,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2016,60210,0.25158891990752535
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9118361,K02NS089852,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diffusion ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Fostering ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' motor deficit ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Motor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter injury ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' neonatal brain ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2016,191131,0.11400177446715715
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.                ",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9020029,R01DC013996,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Only Child ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Production ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' American Sign Language ', ' Sign Language ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,638494,0.26461287576055953
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.        ","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9112198,R03HD084941,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Controlled Vocabulary ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' word learning ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Learning Skill ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2016,78438,0.2692979265871063
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9116242,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' Noise ', ' Phonetics ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' theories ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,263788,0.20123285572283295
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern.

The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9191358,R01DC013996,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' American Sign Language ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602469,0.26461287576055953
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9297279,R01DC015642,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,606922,0.30284283476609286
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9313700,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Memory ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,267749,0.20123285572283295
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9352674,F31DC015370,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' farmer ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' natural language ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' comprehension deficit ', ' language impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2017,24909,0.3139044222443263
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling

"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9242682,R03HD084941,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Controlled Vocabulary ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' word learning ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Learning Skill ', ' language impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2017,78500,0.2692979265871063
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9609288,F32DC017373,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' farmer ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' language processing ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2018,58282,0.2708508446472145
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9506574,R01DC015642,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Special Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,606922,0.30284283476609286
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9533881,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' Bats ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Memory ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' longterm memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,266324,0.20123285572283295
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9522332,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666236,0.32213435364615833
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling

"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9445282,R21DC016069,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' auditory pathway ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Language ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Michigan ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' auditory deprivation ', ' sound deprivation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Surgical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 4 year old ', ' neural model ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' cognitive ability ', ' individual patient ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' personalized management ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' preservation ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,245338,0.23882118967985982
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9471944,R01HD037082,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' lexical ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594063,0.32879271297746093
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia.

"The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD Abstract ! Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show enormous heterogeneity in core language abilities, such as phonology and grammar. Over 50% of verbal children with ASD have borderline or impaired language. Deciphering how children with ASD learn language is important for understanding the heterogeneity of language abilities in this population, as well as for the development of more effective interventions for children with ASD who also have language difficulties. Based on decades of behavioral research in typical language acquisition, statistical learning is essential for encoding rich regularities and variability for first language development. Whereas statistical learning has been linked to typical language development and Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), existing studies investigating statistical learning in ASD lack consensus regarding whether statistical learning is impaired in ASD. Both the enormous heterogeneity of ASD population and the recently reported variation in one’s ability to learn statistics across linguistic and non-linguistic domains, as well as across sensory modalities, might have contributed to such inconclusive results. The overall goal of this research is to understand whether the language heterogeneity in ASD can be attributed to variations of statistical learning in a specific domain (linguistic vs. nonlinguistic) or modality (auditory vs. visual). Aim 1 proposes to first characterize the relationship between children’s language abilities and statistical-learning profiles across domains and modalities in a large sample of children with ASD (6 to 8 years old) and typically developing (TD) controls. Both groups will be evaluated using a novel web-based testing platform. Aim 2 will focus on probing the neural mechanisms during statistical learning in each domain and modality in ASD, and how relative strengths and weaknesses in the groupings are related to language performance. Comparing the neural responses during statistical learning tasks among children with ASD in relation to high vs. low statistical learning abilities grouped by domain and modality, the study will test whether language performance in ASD is related to domain-specific, modality-specific, or domain/modality-general neural substrates of statistical learning. The proposed study will pave the way towards a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in language impairment in ASD. The results will provide crucial preliminary data for future investigations aiming to elucidate the causal relationship between statistical learning ability and language learning in a longitudinal intervention study and how statistical learning profile is related to different genetic risks in children with ASD. Narrative: The proposed research aims to understand the cognitive and neural bases of learning mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of language abilities in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The findings of this work will characterize the behavioral phenotypes of statistical learning in a large sample of children with ASD and provide critical pilot data for the brain bases that constrain language learning in children with ASD.!",The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD,9813899,R21DC017576,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' autistic children ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' children with autism ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' phonology ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 8 years of age ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven years of age ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' 11 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive process ', ' Foundational Skills ', ' Learning Skill ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,152317,0.1683277510287338

The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9600692,R01DC013996,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' American Sign Language ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,568221,0.26461287576055953
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9729661,R01DC015642,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,606922,0.30284283476609286
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.

"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9733185,R21DC016069,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' auditory pathway ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Michigan ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' auditory deprivation ', ' sound deprivation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Surgical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 4 year old ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' neural model ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' cognitive ability ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' personalized management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' preservation ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' deaf ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' deafened ', ' normal hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2019,173098,0.23882118967985982
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communication impairment ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,0.13281042307191826
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD Abstract Language delay is often one of the first concerns of parents of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and early language abilities predict broader outcomes for children on the autism spectrum. Yet, mechanisms underlying language deficits in children with ASD remain unspecified. One prominent component of linguistic behavior is the use of predictions or expectations during learning and processing. Several researchers have recently posited prediction-deficit accounts of ASD. The basic assumption of the prediction accounts is that information is processed by making predictions and testing violations against expectations (prediction errors). Flexible (neurotypical) brains attribute differential weights to prediction errors to determine when new learning is appropriate, while individuals with ASD are thought to assign disproportionate weight to prediction errors. These prediction deficits are hypothesized to lead to higher levels of perceived novelty, resulting in `hyperplasticity' of learning based on the most recent input. The proposed project will be the first study to examine whether language deficits in young children with ASD are linked to atypical domain-general prediction processes. Seven studies are proposed to address the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the ability of toddlers with ASD to generate predictions compared to typically developing (TD) peers; (2) to establish whether toddlers with ASD exhibit hyperplasticity of learning relative to TD peers; (3) to examine the extent to which certain child characteristics predict individual variability in predictive behavior and hyperplasticity in toddlers with ASD; and (4) establish whether predictive behavior or hyperplasticity of learning on verbal/visual tasks predicts vocabulary and/or syntactic ability one year later in young children with ASD. The sample will be comprised of 75 ASD toddlers (three cohorts of 25 toddlers) and 75 TD controls distribution-matched on cognition (raw scores), SES, and sex. In this project we will utilize anticipatory eye movements (AEMs) and looking-while-listening (LWL) methods to investigate prediction in visual and verbal tasks in toddlers with and without ASD. Studies 1 (auditory) and 2 (visual) examine prediction as indexed by AEMs under conditions in which probabilities of the occurrence of events are relatively stable. Studies 3 (verbal) and 4 (nonverbal) will investigate hyperplasticity of learning in AEM tasks in which probabilities of the events change and predictions must be updated. Study 5 will explore hyperplasticity within the context of novel word learning using a LWL task. Study 6 will examine the relationship between child characteristics (cognition, language, autism symptom severity) and prediction. In Study 7, performance on Studies 1-5 will be used to predict language abilities in the same sample of toddlers one year later (from 18-35 mo to 30-47 mo) using both standardized tasks and an online incremental language processing task. All studies were developed to have minimal task demands in order to include toddlers with ASD across a wide range of functioning. Findings from this research will provide important new insights into ASD phenotypes and mechanisms underlying language development that could open new pathways for intervention. Project Narrative Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenges in numerous domains of functioning which often include significant impacts on language development. The proposed research investigates the assumption that individuals with ASD have difficulties making predictions, leading to atypical learning. Using methods designed to study learning in toddlers based on their eye movements, the proposed studies will examine links between language abilities and performance on verbal and visual learning tasks in toddlers with ASD and toddlers with typical development.",Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD,9797068,R01DC017974,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Matched Group ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Learning ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' autistic children ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' children with autism ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' interest ', ' visual learning ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Toddler ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' sequence learning ', ' language processing ', ' central coherence ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' word learning ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,609106,0.10452956582431382
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9607105,R01HD037082,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' lexical ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' deaf ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' deafened ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,580188,0.32879271297746093
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9753018,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' longterm memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,268205,0.20123285572283295
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9788034,F32DC017373,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' farmer ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' language processing ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2019,22217,0.2708508446472145
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9836112,F31DC018220,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Connecticut ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Logic ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Word Processing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' phonology ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' clinical risk ', ' neural correlate ', ' word learning ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2019,40450,0.250826311387531
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3.

"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading.

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Language ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Illinois ', ' Infant ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Interruption ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' protective effect ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' high risk ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' word learning ', ' language impairment ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,0.3118205422594653
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Language ', ' language training ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' model building ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' clinical database ', ' FHIR ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' ']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,470604,0.11593502843944087
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal

"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering.

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9825536,R01DC013996,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' American Sign Language ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,574747,0.26461287576055953
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' career networking ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' improved outcome ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,0.13281042307191826
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9875268,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family history of ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,663947,0.32213435364615833
"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9975626,F31DC018220,"['multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' clinical risk ', ' neural correlate ', ' word learning ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' support vector machine ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Connecticut ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Logic ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Word Processing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Early Intervention ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' phonology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2020,15602,0.250826311387531
"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death.

Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,9913498,R01DC017736,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hearing ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Neurites ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Organizational Change ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic children ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Peripheral ', ' Diffuse ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Auditory system ', ' myelination ', ' phonology ', ' early childhood ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Toddler ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' TEP1 ', ' TLP1 ', ' TP1 ', ' hTEP1 Gene ', ' TEP1 gene ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Impairment ', ' critical period ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' longitudinal design ', ' language impairment ', ' translational impact ', ' auditory processing ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,592142,0.2814785775377272
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.
