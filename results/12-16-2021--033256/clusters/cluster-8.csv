"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.  Using this combination of techniques it should be possible to detect any post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by rat hepatocytes in response to chronic injury.

"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"INTERACTIVE 3-D COMPUTER ANIMATION AND ANALYSIS OF SPORT More Americans than ever before are participating in competitive sports, and the number of sports-related injuries has increased to about 17 million per year.  For the elderly, such injuries often signal an end to vigor, productivity, and enjoyment of their lifestyle.  At the same time, American performance in inter- national sports competition seems to be declining if one is to judge by Olympic medals, Davis Cup, Ryder Cup, World Cup Skiing, and the like.  The field of computer biomechanics has proved useful both for improvement in athletic performance and for analysis of injury- causing motion.  But application of the method in sports medicine is hampered by the lack of a basic measurement tool a general method for digitization of the entire human body which is accurate, rapid, and inexpensive, i.e. automatic.  The long-range goal of this proposal (Phase II) is to provide such a method and put it on the market.  In Phase I, we propose to carry out the basic feasibility studies for the video imaging method of Joint center coordinate determination, and to field test, refine, and expand our pilot 3-D BIOVISION software for computer animation and analysis of top professional golf models.

"RESPONSIVE PLANNING FOR MULTIPLE GOAL SATISFACTION Injuries, accidental and intentional, result in more years of human life lost in the United States than any other disease.  The purpose of the American College of Surgeon's Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course is to enable physicians to provide immediate expert response in the initial evaluation, resuscitation, and stabilization of severely injured patients, prior to their initial definitive management.  The goal of our system, TraumAID, is to optimize this next phase.  TraumAID is a surgical consultation system for the initial definitive care of injuries.  It currently deals with penetrating injuries to the abdomen and chest.  Our specific aim is to improve its performance through the design, implementation and validation of a module that can take a set of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and integrate them into a sensible and coherent plan.  In doing this, our goals are two-fold.  We hope both to increase TraumAID's clinical accuracy and practical utility - i.e., the range of cases on which it can produce patient-specific protocols equivalent to those of trauma experts - and to develop a general approach to the problem of formulating plans that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  The planner we propose to design and build complements the logical reasoning already done by the system.  Logical reasoning produces recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that address the system's suspicions and conclusions.  The purpose of the planner is to weave these recommendations into a clinically valid plan.  Since a plan that contains diagnostic procedures cannot, by definition, have its final therapeutic goals known initially, the system consisting of both reasoner and planner is designed to operate incrementally:  as the physician follows the plan, findings and results that emerge from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that address them.  These the planner will use in forming a revised plan.  In forming its plans, the planner's decisions will be based on standard practices of trauma care, logistics, and a rich knowledge of procedures.  It will use these to create an coarse ordering of the recommended procedures, resolve conflicts between them, and then optimize the resulting plan.  While the resulting plan may be revised again, in response to new information, an entire plan is presented so that the physician may at all times be aware of what may still be pending and why.  As part of this proposal, an initial validation will be done of the combined system (reasoner plus planner), just as such validations have been done of its abdomen and chest modules.

"TESTING A DECISION AID FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INJURIES The goal of this project is to optimize the clinical management of a significant acute clinical problem with a high variation in outcome between specialized centers and community hospitals, namely the initial definitive management of acutely injured patients after resuscitation and stabilization.  The objective is to rigorously evaluate a recently developed artificial intelligence decision aid to improve the initial definitive management of patients with injuries, specifically to evaluate the recommendations of an expert system that makes recommendations for the initial definitive management of patients, currently confined to those with stab wounds and gunshot wounds of the chest and abdomen.  The specific aims of this pilot study are to show that the program makes recommendations comparable to actual care (face and criterion-based validity), to show that patients whose care is the same as the recommendations of the program are unlikely to have bad outcomes from errors in judgement (predictive validity), to show that the program can be changed to reflect changes in the standards of care, to show that it is practical to use the program during the actual care of the patient, and to show that using the program does improve the care plan for the patient.  The evaluation will be done using 200 cases abstracted retrospectively and 100 cases tested prospectively in a trauma center.  The recommendations will be evaluated using the best professional judgment of both local trauma surgeons and national trauma experts.  The long term objective is to expand the expertise of the program to generate recommendations for the initial definitive management of multiple trauma for adult patients with penetrating or blunt injuries to any part of the body, specifically stab wounds, gunshot wounds, vehicular accidents, falls, or beatings.  Such programs could be information resources for practice guidelines, quality assurance, education, intelligent data collection and other research.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED TRAUMA MANAGEMENT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES Trauma is one of the leading causes of death and disability in rural communities.  Many of these fatalities and disabilities could be avoided if significant injuries were detected earlier or if there were improvements in resuscitation and stabilization of the injured patients.  We are proposing to develop a microcomputer-based program, specifically an expert system, to aid rural health-care professionals in the diagnosis, treatment, stabilization, and triage of trauma victims.  Such a program could serve as an educational tool as well as stimulating recall and acting as a second opinion during actual medical emergencies.  During Phase I, the proposed program will be developed in four stages: a literature search, interviews with six health-care professionals in two rural clinics and two regional trauma centers, development of an expert-system trauma advisor for head injuries based on these interviews and evaluation of this program with the same healthcare professionals.  In Phase II all types of trauma will be considered using consultants from a greater diversity of rural communities.  This type of program is an innovative approach to training and skill maintenance for those who work in rural medical clinics and also offers these professionals a ready reference during actual medical emergencies.

"CORRELATES OF FERTILITY IN SPINAL CORD-INJURED MEN This proposal seeks support for our studies on the effect of spinal cord injury on male reproduction.  Although anejaculation is a relatively uncommon occurrence in the general population, over 12,000 new cases are reported annually.  The major cause of ejaculatory dysfunction is spinal cord injury, usually occurring as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Infertility in spinal cord injured men is reported to approach 95%.  This impaired fertility is thought to be due to anejaculation secondary to neuromuscular dysfunction, obstruction of the genital passages secondary to infections and/or impaired spermatogenesis.  Electroejaculation, a procedure for inducing the seminal fluid emission by electrically stimulating specific nerves of the male reproductive tract with rectal probe electrostimulation, has been used to obtain sperm from these patients.  Nevertheless, poor sperm quality has been a consistent finding and pregnancy rates remain low.  Although adequate sperm densities usually can be obtained, the low sperm motility appears to be a limiting factor.  The information on variables that correlate with semen quality and ultimate pregnancy success or failure is far from complete.  We have proposed to develop a standardized protocol to be used in a large multi-- institutional study of electroejaculation (EEJ) of SCI men to correlate patient evaluation, treatment and data collection.  We will evaluate the epididymal secretion of specific proteins, as well as the hormonal and spermatogenic characteristics of a large population of spinal cord injured men.  Changes in genital tract protein secretion after neurologic injury will provide the potential to develop a useful prognostic assay for damage to the proximal ductal system.

"RESPONSIVE PLANNING FOR MULTIPLE GOAL SATISFACTION Injuries, accidental and intentional, result in more years of human life lost in the United States than any other disease.  The purpose of the American College of Surgeon's Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course is to enable physicians to provide immediate expert response in the initial evaluation, resuscitation, and stabilization of severely injured patients, prior to their initial definitive management.  The goal of our system, TraumAID, is to optimize this next phase.  TraumAID is a surgical consultation system for the initial definitive care of injuries.  It currently deals with penetrating injuries to the abdomen and chest.  Our specific aim is to improve its performance through the design, implementation and validation of a module that can take a set of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and integrate them into a sensible and coherent plan.  In doing this, our goals are two-fold.  We hope both to increase TraumAID's clinical accuracy and practical utility - i.e., the range of cases on which it can produce patient-specific protocols equivalent to those of trauma experts - and to develop a general approach to the problem of formulating plans that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  The planner we propose to design and build complements the logical reasoning already done by the system.  Logical reasoning produces recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that address the system's suspicions and conclusions.  The purpose of the planner is to weave these recommendations into a clinically valid plan.  Since a plan that contains diagnostic procedures cannot, by definition, have its final therapeutic goals known initially, the system consisting of both reasoner and planner is designed to operate incrementally:  as the physician follows the plan, findings and results that emerge from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that address them.  These the planner will use in forming a revised plan.  In forming its plans, the planner's decisions will be based on standard practices of trauma care, logistics, and a rich knowledge of procedures.  It will use these to create an coarse ordering of the recommended procedures, resolve conflicts between them, and then optimize the resulting plan.  While the resulting plan may be revised again, in response to new information, an entire plan is presented so that the physician may at all times be aware of what may still be pending and why.  As part of this proposal, an initial validation will be done of the combined system (reasoner plus planner), just as such validations have been done of its abdomen and chest modules.

"TESTING A DECISION AID FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INJURIES The goal of this project is to optimize the clinical management of a significant acute clinical problem with a high variation in outcome between specialized centers and community hospitals, namely the initial definitive management of acutely injured patients after resuscitation and stabilization.  The objective is to rigorously evaluate a recently developed artificial intelligence decision aid to improve the initial definitive management of patients with injuries, specifically to evaluate the recommendations of an expert system that makes recommendations for the initial definitive management of patients, currently confined to those with stab wounds and gunshot wounds of the chest and abdomen.  The specific aims of this pilot study are to show that the program makes recommendations comparable to actual care (face and criterion-based validity), to show that patients whose care is the same as the recommendations of the program are unlikely to have bad outcomes from errors in judgement (predictive validity), to show that the program can be changed to reflect changes in the standards of care, to show that it is practical to use the program during the actual care of the patient, and to show that using the program does improve the care plan for the patient.  The evaluation will be done using 200 cases abstracted retrospectively and 100 cases tested prospectively in a trauma center.  The recommendations will be evaluated using the best professional judgment of both local trauma surgeons and national trauma experts.  The long term objective is to expand the expertise of the program to generate recommendations for the initial definitive management of multiple trauma for adult patients with penetrating or blunt injuries to any part of the body, specifically stab wounds, gunshot wounds, vehicular accidents, falls, or beatings.  Such programs could be information resources for practice guidelines, quality assurance, education, intelligent data collection and other research.  Meeting the standards of this initial evaluation would justify dissemination, continued refinement, and expansion of this computer-based decision aid that provides guidelines for the initial definitive management of injured patients in a format appropriate for clinical care, education, control of liability, and review of the quality of care.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED TRAUMA MANAGEMENT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES Trauma is one of the leading causes of death and disability in rural communities.  Many of these fatalities and disabilities could be avoided if significant injuries were detected earlier or if there were improvements in resuscitation and stabilization of the injured patients.  We are proposing to develop a microcomputer-based program, specifically an expert system, to aid rural health-care professionals in the diagnosis, treatment, stabilization, and triage of trauma victims.  Such a program could serve as an educational tool as well as stimulating recall and acting as a second opinion during actual medical emergencies.  During Phase I, the proposed program will be developed in four stages: a literature search, interviews with six health-care professionals in two rural clinics and two regional trauma centers, development of an expert-system trauma advisor for head injuries based on these interviews and evaluation of this program with the same healthcare professionals.  In Phase II all types of trauma will be considered using consultants from a greater diversity of rural communities.

"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm. Results of this pilot study will be used to design a future multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial.

"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         ",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['laboratory rat ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' spinal cord injury ', ' psychomotor function ', ' limb movement ', ' gait ', ' ']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,219209,0.06713767264613664
"A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO PEDIATRIC TRAUMA TRIAGE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injuries result in more deaths in children than all other causes combined. Because injured children have better outcomes at centers with specialized trauma care, appropriate transport to these centers may reduce morbidity and mortality. Prehospital information must be used to determine the need for transport to a trauma center and for planning care after arrival. Several triage schemes have been evaluated for stratifying minimally and severely injured children based on prehospital information. These have used a diverse range of inputs, including physiological parameters, anatomic site of injury and mechanism of injury, and have used both linear techniques of analysis and logistic regression. Despite these efforts, no pediatric trauma triage method has yet met the goal of being sufficiently accurate (avoiding under- or over-triage) and reproducible. One potential explanation for the limited success of triage criteria developed using standard regression and classification techniques is the complexity of prehospital data and the uncertain relationship of this data to outcome. Neural networks are a family of models that have an advantage over conventional methods when classification requires using different types of input data or the relationships between these variables and the final classification are vaguely understood. While their use for triage has not been described, neural networks have been better than logistic regression methods in predicting morbidity and mortality in adult trauma patients. Neural networks may be well suited for analysis of pediatric trauma triage because of the diversity and age-specificity of prehospital variables and the uncertain relationship between these variables and the outcome of injured children. These observations have led to the hypothesis that a neural network can more accurately classify pediatric trauma patients by severity of injury and need for hospital resources than current triage methods. Neural networks will be trained to classify injured children based on severity of injury and need for hospital resources using information available to prehospital providers. The classification accuracy of trained networks will be compared with that based on current triage strategies.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           ",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Support Techniques ', ' Decision Support Technics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Support of Research ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Injury Severity Score ', ' ISS Score ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Numbers ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' tool ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' information gathering ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' injured ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,0.038294130890952516
"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.

"Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this G20 proposal is to create a shared Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility (NCAF) to study acute and long-term responses in large animal models of disease and injury to enable the development and translation of new treatments and technologies that promote and preserve neurological function. This revised proposal responds specifically and substantively to each comment raised in the initial review. The NCAF will be a one-of-a-kind shared porcine facility for the study of neurological injury and recovery after stroke, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, and traumatic brain injury in pigs/piglets d 25kg. The facility will consist of 5 components: (1) a non-sterile procedure room for closed head injuries and terminal procedures, (2) an intensive care housing room, (3) a cognitive and behavioral assessment laboratory, (4) a survival surgical room, and (5) animal prep area. Facilities will be upgraded to allow survival surgery on USDA-regulated species and meet requirements of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILAR, 1996; pre-publication, 2010), and provide a state-of-the art intensive care unit for monitoring and housing animals. Additional space will be renovated to serve as procedural space for cognitive and behavioral assessment using a battery of porcine-specific tests developed by the Facility Director. Finally, the NCAF facility will be upgraded to meet federal and other regulatory requirements that ensure safety, sanitization, security, vermin control and environmental control for surgery, experimental procedure, intensive care housing and behavioral study areas. The NCAF will be used for the study of more than 800 piglets/pigs per year, and will be shared by 25 investigators spanning the School of Medicine (SOM) and School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) with over $42, million in current and pending funding. Moreover, this new facility will be a unique opportunity to create synergy between SOM faculty investigating cell and molecular approaches to therapeutic interventions that preserve neurofunction, with SEAS faculty who are innovators in device development, data integration, data processing, machine learning, biosensors and minimally invasive surgical technology. Thus, these renovations will enhance PHS-funded research, will advance the conduct of animal welfare in experimental research, and will positively impact the scope and pace of the preclinical research at Penn.          ",Neurointensive Care and Assessment Facility,8188836,G20RR029785,"['Intensive Care ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Cardiopulmonary Bypass ', ' heart bypass ', ' Heart-Lung Bypass ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Security ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Animal Housing ', ' guide for the care and use of laboratory animals ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' data integration ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ensure ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Funding ', ' Schools ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Caring ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Technology ', ' Biosensor ', ' sensor (biological) ', ' Housing ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Family suidae ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Faculty ', ' Area ', ' Translations ', ' Acute ', ' Research ', ' Behavioral ', ' Cells ', ' Animals ', ' Safety ', ' Engineering ', ' response ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Injury ', ' Laboratories ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Goals ', ' meetings ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Testing ', ' Molecular ', ' Monitor ', ' Procedures ', ' neurological recovery ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Closed head injuries ', ' Nonpenetrating Head Injuries ', ' Closed Head Trauma ', ' ']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,G20,2011,500000,0.015589917336878341

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation.  Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.              Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.                 Narrative This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Di(R)usion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Near Miss Narratives from the Fire Service: A Bayesian Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009). Near miss reporting systems have made major contributions to safety in such industries as aviation, nuclear power, petrochemical processing, steel production, and military operations, because the same patterns of causes of failure and their relations precede both adverse events and near misses. However, firefighters and researchers lack a scientific system to fully analyze the near miss data collected each year. This innovative effort will advance knowledge in firefighter safety by applying novel Bayesian methods of analysis to the narrative text fields of a new data source that has not yet been rigorously investigated. The proposal has 3 aims:  I. to use recently developed auto coding methods to characterize firefighter near miss narratives and classify these narratives into mechanisms of risk/injury. This analysis will apply the International Classification of External Cause of Injuries (ICECI) using Bayesian machine learning techniques to identify the various mechanisms captured in the near miss narratives and their relative prevalence.  II. To identify the correlation between each mechanism of risk/injury and each of the ""Contributing Factors"" listed on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will reveal any patterns and trends in the distribution of the contributing factors among the mechanisms, creating a deeper understanding of near miss circumstances, as well as a basis for improving the quality of future near miss data collection.  III. To use manual coding to identify actual injury incidents contained within a random sample of 1,000 near miss narratives and correlate these injuries with the ""Loss Potential"" categories on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will demonstrate how actual injuries are distributed within the reporting form's ""Loss Potential"" categories. This proposed study of the near miss narrative text in combination with coded data has the potential to reveal new insights that can strengthen firefighter safety through primary prevention. This study addresses a major gap in firefighter safety knowledge, i.e. the insufficient understanding of near miss events, and will have a high impact on efforts to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters.

"Developing an online educational curriculum to enhance parent-supervised driving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs. The CDC has identified traffic crashes and associated injuries as a top public health priority. Inexperience is the leading cause of crashes among novice teen drivers, but accumulating the necessary experiences to become a safe driver can take many years. Fortunately, evidence from driving and other domains suggests that it is possible to increase experiential knowledge through scenario-based training. Current methods for providing teens with practice focus on parent-supervised driving. However, parents are ill-prepared to handle this role, with many focusing only on the mechanics of driving, laws and general safety advice. Few parents discuss decision-making aspects of driving and may even pass on inaccurate information. Many parents limit the range of driving situations teens are exposed to mistakenly believing that this increases safety rather than dangerously limiting teens' ability to accumulate important driving experience. Our long-term objective is to design and validate an innovative tool that aims to accelerate the acquisition of critical safety knowledge for teen drivers. We propose to extend our team's past work by developing scenarios appropriate for parents to use to mentor their inexperienced teen drivers. The scenarios will be part of an online educational curriculum designed to help parents provide teens with guided practice as they learn how to drive. The online tool will combine scenario- based training with innovative applications of machine learning technology to evaluate scenario responses and provide tailored feedback containing practical, developmentally appropriate strategies for improving safety as well as recommendations for parent-supervised on-the-road practice. Phase I will address these specific aims: 1) Conduct foundational research to identify realistic scenarios commonly encountered by novice teen drivers through semi-structured interviews with teen drivers aged 15-18. 2) Collect representative responses to scenarios from teens with different levels of driving experience and adults to identify the progression of knowledge and identify developmentally appropriate strategies to use as feedback. 3) Create machine learning algorithms to provide tailored feedback and recommend on-the-road driving experiences based on responses to the scenarios. 4) Develop prototype online system. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 5) Develop the Phase I proof of concept into a complete online curriculum with refined algorithms. 6) Evaluate the online curriculum for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a driving simulator experiment and limited field trial with novice teen drivers. The proposed product represents a significant shift in trainig approaches for teen drivers and through Phase III dissemination it will fill a critical need for evidence- based parent-taught driver's education.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.              Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation.  Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.        Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting ', '

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients.

"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Flow Velocity ', ' concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Spin Labels ', ' Sports ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' CBF ', ' Core-Binding Factor ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Licensing ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' high school ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' injured ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' balance testing ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' mTBI ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Physical Performance ', ' brain health ', ' cerebral hemodynamics ', ' ']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1440519,0.12285239107519029

"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Corpus Callosums ', ' Corpus Callosum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Far Go ', ' FarGo ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' white matter injury ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' neuropsychological ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mood regulation ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' Patient risk ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' mTBI ', ' axon injury ', ' axonal injury ', ' axonal damage ', ' axon damage ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,0.1049082146221897
"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability.

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Animals ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Attention ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' clotting factor ', ' Coagulation Factors ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endothelium ', ' Evolution ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Ligands ', ' Maps ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015).

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9401793,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Axon ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Recombinant C5a ', ' Complement C5a ', ' C5a ', ' C5 a ', ' Complement 5a ', ' Bruise ', ' Contusions ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Injectable ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Dorsal ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' novel ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' Institution ', ' small molecule ', ' Dose ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' axonal regeneration ', ' axon regeneration ', ' axonal growth ', ' axon growth ', ' injured ', ' reconstruction ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' SCI Patients ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapeutic target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' regenerative ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,474406,0.10525809940676675
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9357691,U01MH110925,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Budgets ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' endophenotype ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2017,4969685,-0.008413565630278851
"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease.

"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Corpus Callosums ', ' Corpus Callosum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' FarGo ', ' Far Go ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' white matter injury ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mood regulation ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' Patient risk ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' MTBI ', ' axon injury ', ' axonal injury ', ' axonal damage ', ' axon damage ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,0.1049082146221897
"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9348493,R44GM123799,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Creatinine ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Equipment ', ' body fluid balance therapy ', ' Fluid Therapy ', ' Grant ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' pressure ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Syndrome ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' vasopressor ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Catheters ', ' Guidelines ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' abdominal pressure ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Fluid overload ', ' hypervolemia ', ' Equation ', ' Medical center ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' monitoring device ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' urinary tract catheter infection ', ' catheter associated urinary tract infection ', ' catheter associated UTI ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' ']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,1574973,0.06522790897075646
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spin Labels ', ' Sports ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' CBF ', ' Core-Binding Factor ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Licensing ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' pediatric department ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' high school ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' portability ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' injured ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' balance testing ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' MTBI ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Physical Performance ', ' brain health ', ' cerebral hemodynamics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1806623,0.12285239107519029
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities.

"Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying resiliency to multiple sclerosis related damage is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions.

"Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients This R21 application responds to RFA-MH-18-611 “Altered neuronal circuits, receptors and networks in HIV-induced Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction (R21)”. Despite effective viral suppression from combined antiretroviral therapy, up to 50% of the patients continue to have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The cognitive deficits or impairment in HIV patients may be due to legacy effects from early stages of the infection, residual viral reservoirs with ongoing neuroinflammation, and potential neurotoxicity from some of the antiretroviral medications. Furthermore, co-morbid disorders associated with the aging HIV+ population, the high prevalence of substance use, and host characteristics, may further increase the risk and exacerbate the severity of HAND. Optimal care for patients with HAND requires efficient and appropriate diagnosis that can guide effective treatments. However, the current diagnostic approach for HAND requires lengthy and specialized cognitive tests and involves subjective components. Our overall goal is to develop an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm to assess brain pathology, using objective measures such as alterations in structural connectivity on DTI, augmented with other neuroimaging and clinical variables. Ultimately, this may lead to a robust approach to classify subtypes and to quantify brain injury in HIV-infected individuals. This exploratory project has three specific aims (SA): SA1: Employ an automated unsupervised ML algorithm to detect subgroups of HIV-infected subjects, based solely on DTI tractography (structural connectivity). SA2: Add objective demographic, genetic, clinical, and non-DTI MR variables to the training DTI tractography data set, and determine their effects on predicting HAND and cognitive performance. SA3: Evaluate the optimized model for stability to undersampling, and determine whether it can be generalized to other data sets, including those from multi-center studies (i.e. Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study). Our optimized ML model has the potential to provide efficient, objective and reproducible biomarkers to identify individuals with or at risk for HAND, to guide prevention and treatment for HAND, and thereby ameliorate the burden of HIV infection and dementias. Narrative Although HIV-infected individuals can be treated and have normal life expectancies, up to 50% of them continue to suffer from cognitive problems that are often difficult to evaluate. The current exploratory study aims to use a machine learning algorithm to combine different types of brain imaging and clinical data to generate an objective and reproducible approach to assess brain injury associated with HIV-infection. Our approach, if validated, may provide a useful biomarker to evaluate brain injury and monitor treatments in these patients in both research and clinical settings.",Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients,9623490,R21NS108811,"['Aging ', ' AIDS Dementia Complex ', ' HIV-related dementia ', ' HIV-Associated Cognitive Motor Complex ', ' HIV-1 dementia ', ' HIV-1 associated dementia ', ' HIV associated dementia ', ' HIV Dementia ', ' Dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease ', ' Dementia associated with AIDS ', ' Dementia Due to HIV Disease ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome related dementia ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Dementia Complex ', ' AIDS-related dementia ', ' AIDS-Related Dementia Complex ', ' AIDS with dementia ', ' AIDS Dementia ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Choline ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamine ', ' Q.

"Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease.

"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury  PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9611100,F32DK118870,[''],NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,81158,0.17863696597617115
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Astrocytes ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Production ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Probes ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' Seizures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' innovative technologies ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Devices ', ' Sorting -

"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9431808,K99EY028625,"['Optic Nerve ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vivo ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Retinal ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' human model ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like event ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' ']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,107618,0.06729809747637099
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9554957,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Creatinine ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equipment ', ' Fluid Therapy ', ' body fluid balance therapy ', ' Grant ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' pressure ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Syndrome ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Catheters ', ' Guidelines ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' abdominal pressure ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Fluid overload ', ' hypervolemia ', ' Equation ', ' Medical center ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' monitoring device ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' urinary tract catheter infection ', ' catheter associated urinary tract infection ', ' catheter associated UTI ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' human error ', ' secondary end point ', ' secondary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' primary endpoint ', ' ']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2018,1143986,0.06522790897075646
"Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT  The loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). An accurate characterization of the left ventricular (LV) distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic MR may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention. Only recently have high-resolution LV regional contractile metrics become clinically available to map myocardial ischemic substrates (hibernating, infarcted) across patient-specific LV geometry. Application of MRI-based multiparametric strain analysis in our pilot ischemic MR study group suggested that high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of LV contractile injury may reveal a more complex array of associated regional contractile injury than is discernible from echocardiography. This initial study identified a “sentinel” LV region (basilar and mid subregions of the posterior and posterolateral LV regions) in which the presence of severe contractile injury clearly predisposes to the development of ischemic MR.  We will enroll ischemic coronary artery disease patients with (≥3+ MR; n=90) and without (≤1+ MR; n=90) ischemic MR who are scheduled for standardized surgery (ACC/AHA Clinical Guidelines). Preoperative MRI- based multiparametric strain analysis will provide high-resolution 3D LV topographical maps of regional contractile injury to statistically correlate to occurrence of ischemic MR and to postoperative studies obtained at 3-months and yearly. An independent core laboratory will catalogue all echocardiography-based metrics of ischemic MR for inclusion in Support Vector Machine analyses, along with all other identified clinical variables.  MRI-based LV displacement datasets are obtained in <30 minutes using Navigator-gated Spiral Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE). Patient-specific LV strain fields are calculated using the recently developed Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Regional contractile function is “normalized” by comparing multiple patient-specific strain metric values (at each of 11,520 LV grid points) to their respective average +/- SD values from our normal human strain database, with z- score (SD) calculation (total computer analysis <20 seconds). Support Vector Machine analyses will search all metric variables (multiparametric strain, echo-based metrics, and all clinical variables) for patterns that predict ischemic MR recurrence.  We will use high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of “normalized” LV contractile function to characterize the distribution, magnitude, and reversibility of the regional contractile injury substrates (hibernating; infarcted) associated with ischemic MR. We will then test the hypothesis that the novel application of machine learning Support Vector Machine analyses can identify hybrid combinations of both regional contractile injury patterns and clinical variables that accurately predict post-repair recurrence of ischemic MR. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Since the loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation, an accurate characterization of the left ventricular distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates (hibernating/infarcted) that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic mitral regurgitation may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention.

We will test the hypothesis that in patients with ischemic CAD, the ischemic status of a 4-subregion “sentinel” zone (basilar/mid subregions of posterior/posterolateral regions) is the primary determinant of the presence of significant ischemic MR and that three defining ischemic substrate (infarcted, hibernating) characteristics (location, magnitude, and reversibility) can be used in a hybrid model to predict recurrence of ischemic MR.",Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation,9769299,R56HL136619,"['Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Vessels ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Hibernation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mitral Valve Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Valve Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Incompetence ', ' Mitral Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Incompetence ', ' papillary muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Troponin ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Anterolateral ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Sentinel ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Impairment ', ' Geometry ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2018,389375,0.1318937408395276
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9583334,K99HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning.

"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules.

"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia. The project goal is to use machine learning methods to develop a prescription that prevents second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care.",Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury,9685513,R21LM012922,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Amnesia ', ' Amnesia-Memory Loss ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Intracranial Pressure ', ' Subarachnoid Pressure ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Postoperative Care ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' vasoactive agent ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Agreement ', ' Prevention ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Cerebral Ischemia ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Perioperative ', ' sex ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Outcome ', ' Patients with traumatic brain injury ', ' TBI Patients ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2018,201642,0.02957586444054792
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9515069,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement 5a ', ' Recombinant C5a ', ' Complement C5a ', ' C5a ', ' C5 a ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Dorsal ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' novel ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' Institution ', ' small molecule ', ' Dose ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' axonal regeneration ', ' axon regeneration ', ' axonal growth ', ' axon growth ', ' injured ', ' reconstruction ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' SCI Patients ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' therapeutic target ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' regenerative ', ' screening ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,465464,0.10525809940676675
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Affect ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inpatients ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' prototype ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Patient risk ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' imaging study ', ' clinical decision support ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,330660,0.11429512251074894
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Shock ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Family suidae ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Organ failure ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' data base structure ', ' database structure ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' cardiovascular insufficiency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.0524994943072498
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9547665,UG3NS106899,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Modernization ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' vertebral injury ', ' spine injury ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Injury ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' success ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' Address ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' productivity loss ', ' cost ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' data integration ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' injury response ', ' response to injury ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench to bedside ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' spinal cord & brain injury ', ' spinal cord and brain injury ', ' sharing data ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR principles ', ' data resource ', ' Precision Health ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2018,239813,0.13879453637955233
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9536120,K23HL133495,"['Adult

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9783238,U01MH110925,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Budgets ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' endophenotype ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' clinical decision support ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2018,2500000,-0.008413565630278851
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Antiepileptic Agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurologic Models ', ' Neurological Models ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Time ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Training ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' disease subgroups ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' active comparator ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' effectiveness research ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' improved outcome ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' phenotypic data ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' stroke patient ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,0.07525442763597653
"Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) strikes over 300,000 people in the US annually. Between 30-50% of OHCA survivors experience some degree of long-term neurologic injury, from mild cognitive defects to severe disability. These injuries are the result of a complex set of ischemia-reperfusion phenomena, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), that occurs over the first few days after resuscitation. Prognostication during this critical period, and prediction of neurologic disability, remains an enormous challenge. Serologic markers of brain injury, such as nerve-specific enolase or S100-B, have been tested extensively but have limited predictive value. Quantifying PCAS injury during clinical care has remained a key knowledge gap; with more accurate injury measurement, clinicians would be better able to tailor patient care appropriately by adjusting the intensity of brain-protective therapies including targeted temperature management. Our team has developed a novel approach to injury assessment that applies nanofluidic technology to isolate and analyze brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, small circulating bodies that represent their cells of origin and are released into the blood in greater quantity when cells are damaged or die. Exosomes carry a collection of microRNA (miRNA) species that can be measured and sequenced, allowing for precise analysis of a “transcriptome of brain injury”. When we coupled brain-derived exosomal miRNA analysis with machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that exosomal measurement predicted injury severity after traumatic brain injury. We now seek to apply this technology to post-arrest neurologic assessment; we hypothesize that serial EV sampling will allow for more precise measurement of PCAS-related brain injury. We will perform serial blood sampling of adult (age>17 y) non-traumatic resuscitated OHCA patients (0,6,12,24 h post-arrest) as well as from a negative control set of patients with myocardial infarction and positive control set of patients with significant cerebrovascular accident. We will characterize brain-derived miRNA species from both cohorts, first in a “derivation group” (n=10) and then a “validation group” (n=40) for each cohort. We will collect demographic and clinical outcome data, including neurologic status at discharge and at 90 d via modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized into “good” (mRS 0-2) or “poor” (mRS 3-6) outcome. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to the derivation group to develop an injury predictive tool, which will then be tested in the validation group. We hypothesize that (1) EV-derived miRNA will identify OHCA patients with brain injury at discharge compared to negative controls and (2) miRNA analysis will discriminate between OHCA patients with good or bad outcomes. Finally, we will apply the predictive tool across 4 timepoints in the OHCA cohort, hypothesizing that more injured patients will show a more significant injury miRNA pattern among earlier timepoints. If successful, this strategy could be coupled to post-arrest trials that require real-time neurologic injury evaluation, and could enable clinicians to tailor care to improve long-term neurologic outcomes. NARRATIVE Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest afflicts >300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Many resuscitated victims die before hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury, yet our ability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited.

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients This R21 application responds to RFA-MH-18-611 “Altered neuronal circuits, receptors and networks in HIV-induced Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction (R21)”. Despite effective viral suppression from combined antiretroviral therapy, up to 50% of the patients continue to have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The cognitive deficits or impairment in HIV patients may be due to legacy effects from early stages of the infection, residual viral reservoirs with ongoing neuroinflammation, and potential neurotoxicity from some of the antiretroviral medications. Furthermore, co-morbid disorders associated with the aging HIV+ population, the high prevalence of substance use, and host characteristics, may further increase the risk and exacerbate the severity of HAND. Optimal care for patients with HAND requires efficient and appropriate diagnosis that can guide effective treatments. However, the current diagnostic approach for HAND requires lengthy and specialized cognitive tests and involves subjective components. Our overall goal is to develop an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm to assess brain pathology, using objective measures such as alterations in structural connectivity on DTI, augmented with other neuroimaging and clinical variables. Ultimately, this may lead to a robust approach to classify subtypes and to quantify brain injury in HIV-infected individuals. This exploratory project has three specific aims (SA): SA1: Employ an automated unsupervised ML algorithm to detect subgroups of HIV-infected subjects, based solely on DTI tractography (structural connectivity). SA2: Add objective demographic, genetic, clinical, and non-DTI MR variables to the training DTI tractography data set, and determine their effects on predicting HAND and cognitive performance. SA3: Evaluate the optimized model for stability to undersampling, and determine whether it can be generalized to other data sets, including those from multi-center studies (i.e. Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study). Our optimized ML model has the potential to provide efficient, objective and reproducible biomarkers to identify individuals with or at risk for HAND, to guide prevention and treatment for HAND, and thereby ameliorate the burden of HIV infection and dementias. Narrative Although HIV-infected individuals can be treated and have normal life expectancies, up to 50% of them continue to suffer from cognitive problems that are often difficult to evaluate. The current exploratory study aims to use a machine learning algorithm to combine different types of brain imaging and clinical data to generate an objective and reproducible approach to assess brain injury associated with HIV-infection. Our approach, if validated, may provide a useful biomarker to evaluate brain injury and monitor treatments in these patients in both research and clinical settings.",Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients,9751995,R21NS108811,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Choline ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Q.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9747350,K23HL133495,"['Adult

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology. Project Narrative The proposed research will study the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) optic nerve head (ONH) related structure and glaucoma.

"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9650587,K99EY028625,"['Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Physiology ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retina ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Retinal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' T cell tumor trafficking ', ' T cell infiltration ', ' Immune infiltrates ', ' human model ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like event ', ' retinal ganglion cell regeneration ', ' ']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,107618,0.06729809747637099
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities.

Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,9821055,K23HD096134,"['Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Mentors ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Probability ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Time ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Secondary to ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' muscle strength ', ' Coin ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Movement science ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' translational study ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' neurological recovery ', ' improved mobility ', ' optimized mobility ', ' mobility improvement ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait training ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' patient mobility ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,136420,0.10564743688093106
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant.

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Economics ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Probability ', ' Productivity ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Records ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' dorsal column ', ' posterior column ', ' Physical Function ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Rogaine ', ' Regaine ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' spinal cord imaging ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Motor output ', ' prospective ', ' Spinal cord damage ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' open source ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' motor function recovery ', ' recovered motor function ', ' Locomotor training ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' T2 imaging ', ' motor recovery ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' deep learning ', ' functional independence ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,0.009430005257529584
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9756462,U01MH110925,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Budgets ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' Psychophysics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' high risk ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' clinical decision support ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2019,5432897,-0.008413565630278851
"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia.

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9756832,R01NS111744,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Posttraumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Posttraumatic Epilepsy ', ' Post-Traumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Post-Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Theoretical Techniques ', ' Theoretical Technics ', ' Psychological Technics ', ' Psychologic Techniques ', ' Psychologic Technics ', ' Psychological Techniques ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Voting ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' animal data ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' Antiepileptogenic ', ' Anti-epileptogenic ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,250346,0.07898187595930785
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9757500,F31LM012946,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Reading ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Glasgow Outcome Scale ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Tomography, Computed, Scanners ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' care costs ', ' human error ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,0.08455827198856775
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9788528,R21MH118170,"['Archives ', ' Astrocytes ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Calibration ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' RNA Probes ', ' Seizures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' innovative technologies ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Devices ', ' Sorting -

"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Athletic Injuries ', ' Sports Injuries ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Sports ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Genetic ', ' light weight ', ' lightweight ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' environmental change ', ' injured ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' stem ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' complex biological systems ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' precision genetics ', ' personalized genetics ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision treatment ', ' precision therapies ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' behavioral plasticity ', ' mixed reality ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,0.17047947603918465
"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,9667415,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cues ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Feedback ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hunger ', ' Imagination ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motion ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thirst ', ' Time ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Dissociation ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' member ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Output ', ' injured ', ' feeding ', ' willingness ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Coupled ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.09182038893765243
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego.

"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9746883,R01HL121226,"['Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Blood Vessels ', '

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9675348,UG3NS106899,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Modernization ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' vertebral injury ', ' spine injury ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Injury ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' success ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Address ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' productivity loss ', ' cost ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' data integration ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' functional outcomes ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' spinal cord and brain injury ', ' spinal cord & brain injury ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' FAIR principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' FAIR data ', ' data resource ', ' Precision Health ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2019,298078,0.13879453637955233
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical

"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cognition ', ' Complication ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Post-Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Post-Traumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Posttraumatic Epilepsy ', ' Posttraumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Athletic Injuries ', ' Sports Injuries ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Sports ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Custom ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' environmental change ', ' injured ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' treatment strategy ', ' complex biological systems ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized genetics ', ' precision genetics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' behavioral plasticity ', ' mixed reality ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' data fusion ', ' recovery after injury ', ' recovery following injury ', ' recovery post injury ', ' injury recovery ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,0.17047947603918465
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9989634,F31LM012946,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Glasgow Outcome Scale ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Computed Tomography Scanners ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Data Science ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' care costs ', ' human error ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,32086,0.08455827198856775
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,10236755,R03HD094577,"['Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Economics ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Productivity ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' posterior column ', ' dorsal column ', ' Physical Function ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Regaine ', ' Rogaine ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' spinal cord imaging ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Motor output ', ' prospective ', ' Spinal cord damage ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' open source ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' recovered motor function ', ' motor function recovery ', ' Locomotor training ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' motor recovery ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' deep learning ', ' functional independence ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2020,46297,0.009430005257529584
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10042756,F32NS117728,"['Affect ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Closed head injuries ', ' Closed Head Trauma ', ' Nonpenetrating Head Injuries ', ' non-penetrating head injuries ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Common Data Element ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' controlled cortical impact ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' injury response ', ' response to injury ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bedside ', ' preclinical research ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' data sharing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' Data Science ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' multiple data sets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' Data Commons ', ' data framework ', ' data curation ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69810,0.15017612847378126
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine,

"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Link ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' novel ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Myocardial ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' case-based ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' individual patient ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' feature selection ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.06570406962886563
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10003374,K23HD096134,"['Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Secondary to ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' muscle strength ', ' Coin ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Movement science ', ' Kinesiology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' translational study ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' neurological recovery ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' improved mobility ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' patient mobility ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,132314,0.10564743688093106
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10266768,K99HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['Abbreviations ', ' Affect ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' Axon ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Retina ', ' central retinal artery ', ' Retinal Artery ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Structure of central vein of the retina ', ' Central Retinal Vein ', ' Retinal Vein ', ' retina blood vessel structure ', ' Retinal Blood Vessels ', ' Retinal Vessels ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Veins ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' vascular factor ', ' vascular component ', ' Measures ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' retina ischemia ', ' retinal ischemia ', ' Velocimetries ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Ocular Tonometry ', ' Intraocular pressure test ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' Performance ', ' retina circulation ', ' attenuation ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Glossary ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Optic Nerve Transections ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' traditional therapy ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' data acquisition ', ' prototype ', ' metabolic rate ', ' preservation ', ' retina imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,0.07340664968171515
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury According to the World Health Organization, corneal blindness from disease and injury is one of the top causes of blindness. Diabetes increases the risk of improper wound repair after minor scratches, corneal transplantation, and removal of epithelium during vitrectomy or refractive surgery. Altered focal adhesion, hemidesmosome, and cell-cell junction dynamics are common hallmarks of poor wound healing. Our group has demonstrated increased expression of the ATP-binding purinoreceptor, P2X7 in human diabetic corneas and in a murine model of Type II diabetes (DIO) accompanied by impaired wound healing. Furthermore, changes in P2X7 alters focal adhesion turnover and actin bundling in vitro that may lead to impaired wound healing. We have preliminary data from both wounded corneal epithelial cultures and explants demonstrating that sustained calcium oscillations occur after stimulation and travel between cells for hours. We found that when calcium mobilizations were absent between cells at the leading edge, that lamellipodial protrusions were absent. It is not known which receptor is required for this activity; however, we predict that the oscillations are a result of a highly-orchestrated activation of purinoreceptors. Previously we demonstrated that knockdown of specific purinoreceptors altered downstream signaling pathways that involve cell motility and adhesion proteins.  Our goal in this innovative proposal is to use image processing and machine learning to understand the events that occur in cell-cell communication that induce cell migration in corneal epithelia and to examine how these events are mediated in corneas from a diabetic induced obesity murine model. The proposal challenges the accepted paradigm that the cell-cell communication wave in the wounded cornea is a short-lived on-and-off signal, but that it is a prolonged oscillating signal needed for healthy epithelial cell migration to effectively heal the wounded cornea. As the calcium and motility assays yield large data sets and complex patterns, we are collaborating with a neuroscientist and a computer scientist to utilize machine learning to determine when cells will interact if specific receptors or complexes of receptors are activated. To address these questions, we will simultaneously perform live cell imaging of calcium mobilization, actin and ATP release in epithelium of wounded corneas under normal and diabetic conditions. The aims are: 1. To determine if there are specific response signatures elicited by the sustained calcium mobilizations and signaling generated with injury in control corneas and corneas from diet induced obesity mice; and 2. To determine if the intercellular calcium mobilizations required for the initiation of lamellipodial ruffling are necessary for proper migration? Narrative Injury to the cornea can be both painful and compromise vision. We and others have shown that repair and innervation of the diabetic cornea is compromised. Our goal is to use a combination of live cell imaging, computational modeling and molecular tools to determine the changes in signals that tell corneal epithelial cells to heal under control conditions compared to those under pathologic conditions such as diabetes.",Calcium oscillations and cell motility with corneal injury,9853790,R21EY029097,"['Actins ', ' Affect ', ' Biological Assay

"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT:

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing.

"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Glasgow Coma Scale ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurological Models ', ' Neurologic Models ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Training ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Rural ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' active comparator ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' improved outcome ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' phenotypic data ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' stroke patient ', ' side effect ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,0.07525442763597653
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning.

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics Kidney transplantation offers the best quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure. Antibody and T-cell mediated rejection (ABMR and TCMR) are key factors that determine graft survival. Currently, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rejection relies on histopathologic examination which has known limitations such as subjective interpretations, limited reproducibility, and the need for expert transplant pathologists. There is an unmet need to develop more specific and quantitative molecular tests that can complement and enhance conventional histologic assessment. Among the molecular assays, proteome profiling is more attractive than genomic and transcriptomic profiling which are subjected to numerous post-translational and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, morphologic changes form the basis of classifying different allograft diseases. Therefore, the transplant community needs to invest in biopsy-based assays in addition to the blood/urine-based assays that are being developed by others. This study is aimed to fully map the proteomic changes in routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. To meet the needs of personalized medicine, this platform uses a novel strategy and machine learning to simultaneously measure the absolute expression levels of a panel of targeted biomarkers as well as thousands of untargeted proteins. The central hypothesis is that LC-MS/MS can be used to define disease-specific biomarkers using a discovery data set, which can then be followed up by a validation data set to determine if LC-MS/MS based tests can be implemented in clinical practice. In the current project, we will focus on developing molecular assays for ABMR since antibody contributes to graft loss in 60% of patients. Two Aims are proposed. In Aim #1, quantitative proteomic strategies will be used to map proteome-level changes in a discovery set of biopsies with ABMR and its mimics, such as acute tubular injury (ATI), TCMR, BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), and stable renal function (STA). The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers that can distinguish ABMR from its mimics. In Aim #2, the potential ABMR biomarkers obtained in Aim #1 will be validated and optimized in an independent validation data set. Using a hybrid proteomic platform combing targeted, shotgun proteomics and machine learning, information on absolute quantitation of potential protein biomarkers and thousands of other proteins will be collected to build a kidney transplant Protein Atlas for assay development. Successful completion of this study has great potential to be translated into clinical tests that will enhance the diagnosis of ABMR from other diseases that can mimic that pathology. It will also serve as a model for developing a new generation of clincal diagnositc tests that will use routinely fixed biopsy materials. This will eliminate the need for intense biobanking efforts, which have hampered the more widespread implementation of molecular diagnostics into the transplant clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is aimed at devising more accurate and reliable tests for diagnosing rejection of transplanted kidneys. Better tests will lead to more effective treatment, prolong graft life, and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure.",Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases.

"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' prognostic tool ', ' inter-institutional ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational scientist ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' acute care ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' computable phenotypes ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.07252422552322464
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9890853,R01HL121226,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Blood Vessels ', '

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the

"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and

"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Apnea ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' indexing ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Information Theory ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulse Oximetry ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' Polysomnography ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' CPAP ', ' CPAP Ventilation ', ' Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive ', ' Obstructive Sleep Apnea ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Older Population ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' cognitive ability ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' marker evaluation ', ' biomarker evaluation ', ' Risk stratification ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,-0.0021303327435975156
"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10104351,K99NS120278,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ligands ', ' macrophage ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Junction ', ' Myoneural Junction ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sciatic nerve ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sprains and Strains ', ' Standardization ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' mdx mouse ', ' Training ', ' Muscle function ', ' reinnervate ', ' reinnervation ', ' insight ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Myotubes ', ' Rhabdomyocyte ', ' Skeletal Fiber ', ' Skeletal Muscle Cell ', ' Skeletal Muscle Fiber ', ' Skeletal Myocytes ', ' Muscle Fibers ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Autoimmune ', ' Autoimmune Process ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' myogenesis ', ' success ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Experimental Myasthenia ', ' Experimental Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' B220 ', ' CD45 ', ' GP180 ', ' LY5 ', ' PTPRC ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuromuscular ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' progenitor ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' strain injury ', ' tissue repair ', ' connectome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,88722,0.024498366145643196
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",10087165,R00EY028625,"['Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' Immune infiltrates ', ' T cell infiltration ', ' T cell tumor trafficking ', ' immune cell infiltrate ', ' immune infiltration ', ' intratumoral immune cell ', ' tumor immune cell ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' stroke-like event ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' retinal ganglion cell regeneration ', ' recovery after injury ', ' recovery following injury ', ' recovery post injury ', ' injury recovery ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R00,2020,249000,0.06729809747637099
"Combinatorial matrix-mimetic recombinant proteins as engineered nerve guidance conduits ABSTRACT Over 500,000 Americans suffer from peripheral nerve injury (PNI), and despite surgical interventions, most suffer permanent loss of motor function and sensation. Current clinical options for long nerve gap PNI include naturally- derived grafts, which provide native matrix cues to regenerate neurons but suffer from very limited supply and batch-to-batch variability, or synthetic nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), which are easy to manufacture but often fail due to lack of regenerative cues. The main challenge with using any NGC for treatment of PNI is the immense trade-off between providing the complex matrix cues necessary for optimal nerve regeneration while providing a conduit that is readily available, reproducible, and easily fabricated. To overcome this challenge, we propose an entirely new type of biomaterial: a computationally optimized, protein-engineered recombinant NGC (rNGC). This rNGC combines the reliability of synthetic NGCs with the presentation of multiple regenerative matrix cues of natural NGCs. Because current understanding of cell-matrix interactions is insufficient to enable to direct design of a fully functional rNGC, we hypothesize that the use of machine learning, computational optimization methods will allow identification of an rNGC that promotes nerve regeneration similar to the current gold standard autograft. We utilize a family of protein-engineered, elastin-like proteins (ELPs) that are reproducible, with predictable, consistent material properties, and fully chemically defined for streamlined FDA approval. Due to ELPs’ modular design, they have biomechanical (i.e. matrix stiffness) and biochemical (i.e. cell-adhesive ligand) properties that are independently tunable over a broad range. While numerous studies detail the effects of individual biomechanical or biochemical matrix cues on neurite outgrowth using single-variable approaches, their combinatorial effects have been largely unexplored as insufficient knowledge exists to make accurate predictions of their interactions a priori. This fundamentally prohibits the direct design of combinatorial matrix cues. We hypothesize that optimized presentation of biomechanical and biochemical cues will create a microenvironment that better mimics the native ECM milieu, resulting in synergistic ligand cross-talk to improve nerve regeneration. In Aim 1, we use computational optimization methods to identify the combination of ligand identities, ligand concentrations, and matrix stiffness that best enhances neurite outgrowth. We will develop and characterize a library of ELP variants with distinct cell-adhesive ligands derived from native ECM, and assess their ability to support neurite outgrowth from rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In Aim 2, we will validate our in vitro optimization results in a preclinical, rat sciatic nerve injury model. A core-shell, ELP-based rNGC with an inner core matrix of the optimized ELP formulation from Aim 1 will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to enhance therapeutic outcome. Controls include reversed nerve autograft, hollow silicone conduit, and non-optimized ELP- based rNGC. This study would represent the first use of computational optimization methods to design a reproducible, reliable, recombinant biomaterial with multiple regenerative matrix cues.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Adult

"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' built environment ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,0.07499326422704783
"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary

"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year.

"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10096452,R01DK126815,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Adult

"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9931317,R03NS112760,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cues ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hunger ', ' Imagination ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Motion ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Thirst ', ' Time ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Acute Brain Injuries ', ' Dissociation ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' member ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Output ', ' feeding ', ' willingness ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Coupled ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,81000,-0.09182038893765243
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,9954680,R21AG067335,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Atlases ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Crystallization ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' eosinophil ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' macrophage ', ' male ', ' mast cell ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' mastocyte ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity -

"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Staging ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Allografting ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Formalin ', ' Fibrillar Collagen ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Trichrome ', ' Trichrome stain method ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Quantitative Microscopy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' stem ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' Data Science ', ' histologic stains ', ' histological stains ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' digital pathology ', ' renal biopsy ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal fibrosis ', ' kidney fibrosis ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Basement membrane ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biopsy ', ' Buffaloes ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Collagen ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' instrumentation ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Sirius Red F3B ', ' picrosirius red ', ' sirius red F 3B ', ' Measures ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Organ ', ' Microscope ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,0.10018760678754304
"Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis modality for solute and volume control. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high (~75%) but kidney recovery occurs in up to two-thirds of survivors. Fluid overload is a potentially modifiable risk factor associated with these outcomes. However, there are currently no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. Due to recent advances in computer science and widespread big data usage, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach. DL allows construction of risk prediction models using time-series data that incorporate thousands of variables and dynamic changes in these variables derived from multi-dimensional sources and not only static values of these variables. We propose to develop and validate innovative DL approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes using multi-modal data from electronic health records and CRRT machines. We demonstrated superiority of DL models without a-priori variable selection compared to optimized logistic regression (C-Statistic of 0.72 vs. 0.62) for prediction of RRT liberation. We also showed that mortality prediction improved by incorporating changes in clinical data within 6-hour intervals after CRRT initiation. In addition, we identified distinctive mortality risk according to quintiles of achieved net ultrafiltration rates, after adjustment by patient’s weight, duration of CRRT, and other clinical parameters: OR 8.0 (95% CI: 2.7-25.1) when the highest quintile (>36 ml/kg/day) was compared to the lowest quintile (<13 ml/kg/day). We hypothesize that innovative DL approaches integrating time- series data will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction models that can impact CRRT delivery. We will utilize a multi-institutional dataset that encompasses clinical data and CRRT programmatic and therapy data (CRRTnet registry, n=1500 patients) for model development and an independent multi-institutional dataset for validation (n=1500 patients) to: 1) continuously predict short-term (7-day) and medium-term (28-day) liberation from RRT due to kidney recovery; 2) continuously predict 24-hour mortality; and 3) identify and validate sub- phenotypes of patients with AKI on CRRT with differing achieved net ultrafiltration rates. This innovative research will assist 1) the development of novel clinical decision support platforms for guiding informed CRRT delivery and promoting kidney recovery; 2) the identification of sub-phenotypes of patients that can benefit from precision- medicine approaches to fluid removal during CRRT; and 3) the design of interventional studies focusing on fluid removal during CRRT to impact patient-centered outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and hemodynamic instability, yet mortality is high (~75%). Presently, there are no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. We propose to develop and validate innovative deep learning approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes, which could guide CRRT decision-making including intensification, de-escalation, and enrich clinical trials focusing on fluid removal during CRRT.",Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy,10261059,R56DK126930,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Ultrafiltration ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Survivors ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' hypervolemia ', ' Fluid overload ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Performance ', ' solute ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' deep learning ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' risk prediction model ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R56,2020,100000,0.06132181472476379
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,10021207,U01MH110925,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Budgets ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Schedule ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' response ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' high risk ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' recruit ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' clinical decision support ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' posttrauma exposure ', ' post-trauma exposure ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2020,111582,-0.008413565630278851
